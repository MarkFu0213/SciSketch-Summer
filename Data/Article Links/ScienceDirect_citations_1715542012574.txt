Abstract: Background
Inherited perforin deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes severe form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL2). The main aim of this study was to analyze the nature of gene mutations in a cohort of Indian patients with FHL2 and to utilize this knowledge for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.
Methods
13 HLH patients with abnormal perforin expression on NK cells by flow cytometry were included in the study. The entire coding region and intronic splice sites of the PRF1 gene were sequenced from the genomic DNA of these patients.
Results
10 patients from the present series had an early presentation with severe clinical manifestations, while 3 had a delayed onset with unusual presenting features viz Hodgkin's lymphoma, tuberculosis and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Sequence analysis revealed 11 different mutations (8 novel and 3 previously reported) spread over the entire coding region of PRF1 gene. Missense mutation Trp129Ser in heterozygous state was present in all the 3 patients with a delayed onset of the disease.
Conclusion
A wide heterogeneity was observed in the nature of mutations in Indian FHL2 patients. Molecular characterization of PRF1 gene was not only used in the confirmation of diagnosis but also in genetic counseling and pre-natal diagnosis in affected families.

Abstract: Subcellular partitioning of creatine kinase contributes to the formation of patterns in intracellular ATP distribution and the fuelling of cellular processes with a high and sudden energy demand. We have previously shown that brain-type creatine kinase (CK-B) accumulates at the phagocytic cup in macrophages where it is involved in the compartmentalized generation of ATP for actin remodeling. Here, we report that CK-B catalytic activity also helps in the formation of protrusive ruffle structures which are actin-dependent and abundant on the surface of both unstimulated and LPS-activated macrophages. Recruitment of CK-B to these structures occurred transiently and inhibition of the enzyme's catalytic activity with cyclocreatine led to a general smoothening of surface morphology as visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Comparison of the dynamics of distribution of YFP-tagged CK-mutants and isoforms by live imaging revealed that amino acid residues in the C-terminal segment (aa positions 323–330) that forms one of the protein's two mobile loops are involved in partitioning over inner regions of the cytosol and nearby sites where membrane protrusions occur during induction of phagocytic cup formation. Although wt CK-B, muscle-type CK (CK-M), and a catalytically dead CK-B-E232Q mutant with intact loop region were normally recruited from the cytosolic pool, no dynamic transition to the phagocytic cup area was seen for the CK-homologue arginine kinase and a CK-B-D326A mutant protein. Bioinformatics analysis helped us to predict that conformational flexibility of the C-terminal loop, independent of conformational changes induced by substrate binding or catalytic activity, is likely involved in exposing the enzyme for binding at or near the sites of membrane protrusion formation.

Abstract: Background
Monocytes and neutrophils are activated during disseminated intravascular coagulation. Tissue factor, the main initiator of coagulation, is expressed by monocytes, while elastase is released by neutrophils.
Aims
This study investigated tissue factor production by peripheral monocytes after stimulation with human neutrophil elastase.
Methods
Tissue factor mRNA levels were investigated by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and tissue factor protein production was assessed by western blotting when monocytes were exposed to neutrophil elastase with or without preincubation using various inhibitors.
Results
Neutrophil elastase upregulated tissue factor mRNA and protein levels in monocytes. Both U73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor) and TMB-8 (intracellular calcium antagonist) prevented the upregulation of tissue factor mRNA. SB203580 (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor) suppressed this response, but PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor) did not. Ro-318425 (ATP-competitive and selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor) and Go 6976 (inhibitor of conventional PKCs and PKCμ) blocked the upregulation of tissue factor mRNA expression. Go 6983 (broad-spectrum PKC inhibitor) and CGP 4125 (staurosporine analog) partially attenuated it, as did a PKC theta/delta inhibitor.
Conclusions
Neutrophil elastase mainly enhances tissue factor production by monocytes via the phospholipase C/conventional PKC/p38 MAPK pathway, although a novel PKC is also involved.

Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited blood disorder is due to a single amino acid substitution on the beta chain of hemoglobin, and is characterized by anemia, severe infections, acute and chronic pain, and multi-organ damage. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is dedicated to support basic, translational and clinical science research to improve care and ultimately, to find a cure for SCD that causes such suffering. This report provides a detailed analysis of grants funded by the NIH for SCD research in Fiscal Years 2007 through 2013. During this period, the NIH supported 247 de novo grants totaling $272,210,367 that address various aspects of SCD. 83% of these funds supported research project grants investigating the following 5 scientific themes: Pathology of Sickle Red Blood Cells; Globin Gene Expression; Adhesion and Vascular Dysfunction; Neurological Complications and Organ-specific Dysfunction; and Pain Management and Intervention. The remaining 17% of total funds supported career development and training grants; Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grants; large Center grants; and Conference grants. Further analysis showed that the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is the largest funder of SCD research within NIH with 67% of total grants, contributing 77% of total funds; followed by the National Institute for Digestive Diseases and Kidney (NIDDK) that is funding 19% of grants, contributing 13% of total funds. The remaining 14% of grants totaling 10% of the funds were supported by all other NIH Institutes/Centers (ICs) combined. In summary, the NIH is using multiple funding mechanisms to support a sickle cell disease research agenda that is intended to advance the detection, treatment, and cure of this debilitating genetic disease.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents a heterogeneous group of malignancies with great variability in clinical course and response to therapy. Several molecular markers have been described that help to classify AML patients into risk groups. Mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) gene were recently demonstrated in AML. Approximately 20% patients with AML carry DNMT3A gene mutations and were associated with a poor clinical outcome but its clinical implications in Egyptian AML patients are largely unknown. The aim of the study was to study the incidence and prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. A total of 120 patients with de novo AML were examined for mutations in DNMT3A by sequencing. DNMT3A mutations were identified in 34/120 (28%) of AML patients. 15 patients with M4, 14 patients with M5, 3 patient with M2 and 2 patient with M6. DNMT3A mutations were more frequently associated with older age, higher platelet counts and intermediate risk. DNMT3A-mutated patients did not differ regarding complete remission (CR) and disease-free survival (DFS), but had shorter overall survival (OS; P=0.048) than DNMT3A-wild-type patients. Mutations in DNMT3A independently predicted a shorter OS (P=0.049) by multivariate analysis. We concluded that DNMT3A mutations are highly frequent in Egyptian patients with AML and are associated with an unfavorable prognosis.

Abstract: Impaired cardiovascular function during acute myocardial infarction (MI) is partly associated with recruitment of activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils. The protective role of arjunolic acid (AA; 2,3,23-trihydroxy olean-12-en-28-oic acid) is studied in the modulation of neutrophil functions in vitro by measuring the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Neutrophils were isolated from normal and acute MI mice to find out the efficacy of AA in reducing oxidative stress. Stimulation of neutrophils with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) resulted in an oxidative burst of superoxide anion (O2−) and enhanced release of lysosomal enzymes. The treatment of neutrophils with PMA induced phosphorylation of Ser345 on p47phox, a cytosolic component of NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, we observed activated ERK induced phosphorylation of Ser345 in MI neutrophils. Treatment with AA significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of P47phox and ERK in the stimulated controls and MI neutrophils. Oxidative phosphorylation activities in MI cells were lower than in control, while the glycolysis rates were elevated in MI cells compared to the control. In addition, we observed AA decreased intracellular oxidative stress and reduced the levels of O2− in neutrophils. This study therefore identifies targets for AA in activated neutrophils mediated by the MAPK pathway on p47phox involved in ROS generation.

Abstract: Thalassemia is an inherited autosomal recessive blood disorder characterized by the underproduction of globin chains as a consequence of globin gene defects, resulting in malfunctioning red blood cells and oxygen transport. Analysis of globin chains is an important aspect of thalassemia research. In this study we developed a capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method for human globin determination in the diagnosis of thalassemia and hemoglobin variants. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, α/β area ratios were determined for samples from 310 thalassemia patients and healthy controls. The separation was performed on uncoated capillary with simple preparation. Distinct globin peaks were resolved in 17min, and coefficients of variation (CV) for migration time and areas ranged from 0.37%–1.69% and 0.46%–6.71%, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the α/β area ratios gave 100% sensitivity and specificity for indicating β-TI/TM, and 100% sensitivity and 97.4% specificity for Hb H disease. Hemoglobin G-Honolulu (Hb G-Honolulu) and Hb Westmead (Hb WS) were successfully detected using this CZE method. This automated methodology is simple, rapid and cost-effective for the fast determination of human globin chains, which could be an important diagnostic tool in the field of hemoglobinopathies.

Abstract: Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a heterogeneous disorder of iron metabolism. The most common form of the disease is Classic or type 1 HH, mainly caused by a biallelic missense p.Cys282Tyr (c.845G>A) mutation in the HFE gene. However, the penetrance of p.Cys282Tyr/p.Cys282Tyr genotype is incomplete in terms of both biochemical and clinical expressivity. Lack of penetrance is thought to be caused by several genetic and environmental factors. Recently, a lot of evidences on HH genetic modifiers were produced, often without conclusive results. We investigated 6 polymorphisms (rs10421768 in HAMP gene, rs235756 in BMP2 gene, rs2230267 in FTL gene, rs1439816 in SLC40A1 gene, rs41295942 in TFR2 gene and rs2111833 in TMPRSS6 gene) with uncertain function in order to further evaluate their role in an independent cohort of 109 HH type 1 patients. Our results make it likely the role of rs10421768, rs235756, rs2230267 and rs1439816 polymorphisms, respectively in HAMP, BMP2, FTL and SLC40A1 genes in HH expressivity. In addition, previous and our findings support a hypothetical multifactorial model of HH, characterized by a principal gene (HFE in HH type 1) and minor genetic and environmental factors that still have to be fully elucidated.

Abstract: β-Thalassemia/HbE disease is caused by a defective β-globin synthesis that leads to accumulation of excess unbound α-globins, and consequently oxidative stress, ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic anemia. Cell replication and oxidative stress are factors contributing to erosion of telomeres responsible for maintaining genomic stability and cell replication capability. In this study, the rate of telomere shortening in β-thalassemia/HbE patients was compared to the rate of telomere shortening in normal individuals. Telomere length was determined from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 43 β-thalassemia/HbE patients and 22 normal controls using Flow-FISH analysis. The telomere length was shown to be age-dependent in normal group (rs=0.715, P=0.002), whereas severity-dependent telomere shortening was observed in the patients. The telomere length of patients who had severe clinical symptoms (10.07±2.15%) was shorter than that of patients who showed mild symptoms (15.59±2.27%), moderate symptoms (14.50±1.41%) and those in the normal group (14.75±3.11%, P<0.05). Additionally, reticulocyte count and oxidative stress were correlated with telomere length. This indicates that increased oxidative stress and markedly enhanced erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia/HbE patients leads to accelerated telomere erosion in clinically severe patients.

Abstract: For many decades, the major function of mRNA was thought to be to provide protein-coding information embedded in the genome. The advent of high-throughput sequencing has led to the discovery of pervasive transcription of eukaryotic genomes and opened the world of RNA-mediated gene regulation. Many regulatory RNAs have been found to be incapable of protein coding and are hence termed as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, studies in recent years have shown that several previously annotated non-coding RNAs have the potential to encode proteins, and conversely, some coding RNAs have regulatory functions independent of the protein they encode. Such bi-functional RNAs, with both protein coding and non-coding functions, which we term as ‘cncRNAs’, have emerged as new players in cellular systems. Here, we describe the functions of some cncRNAs identified from bacteria to humans. Because the functions of many RNAs across genomes remains unclear, we propose that RNAs be classified as coding, non-coding or both only after careful analysis of their functions.

Abstract: Three major loci have been associated with HbF levels, including −158C/T (XmnI) at HBG2 promoter region, and several polymorphisms at BCL11A intron-2 and HBS1L-MYB (HMIP) intergenic region. Mutations in the KLF1 gene were recently associated with increased HbF levels. This study aims to evaluate whether genetic variability at these loci influences HbF levels in β-thalassemia carriers and in normal individuals of Portuguese origin. Sixty five β-thalassemia carriers, HbF levels ranging from 0.2% to 9.5%, and 60 individuals with normal hematological parameters, HbF levels ranging from 0.2% to 7.4%, were selected for this study. In β-thal carriers linear regression models revealed a strong statistical significant association for HBG2 (XmnI) rs7482144 (β=0.455; P=5.858×10−7), and nominal significance for BCL11A rs766432 (β=0.215; P=0.029) and HMIP rs9399137 (β=0.209; P=0.011). In normal individuals, a case (HbF>2%; n=15) vs. control (HbF<1.7%; n=45) model, showed nominal significant associations for BCL11A SNPs rs11886868 (OR=4; P=0.001), rs766432 (OR=3.7; P=0.002) and rs7606173 (OR=0.36; P=0.032). KLF1 rs3817621 was not found associated with HbF levels. Our results suggest that in Portuguese β-thal carriers the HBG2 XmnI polymorphism is strongly associated with HbF levels. In normal individuals, BCL11A polymorphisms, but not HMIP or HBG2 (XmnI) loci, are nominally associated with HbF expression.

Abstract: It is well established that mTORC1 suppresses autophagy by phosphorylation and inactivation of proteins involved in autophagosome formation. However, the role of its substrate, p70S6 kinase1 (S6K1), in autophagy is quite controversial. In some models S6K1 activity correlates with autophagy suppression, however, some other studies show that S6K1 promotes rather than inhibits this process. Here, we investigated the role of S6K1 in prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and non-cancerous, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), either treated with autophagy inducer sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous plants, or deprived of serum. Our results indicate that constitutively active S6K1 decreases the level of LC3 processing and foci formation by autophagosomal vacuoles in cells treated with sulforaphane. On the other hand, presence of S6K1 is necessary for autophagosome maturation under conditions of autophagy induced by either sulforaphane or serum deprivation. Diminished level of S6K1 or lack of S6 kinases results in both, accumulation of autophagosomes and drop in the autophagolysosome number, and thus disturbs autophagy flux under stress conditions. Moreover, lack of S6 kinases reduces cell survival under stress conditions.

Abstract: Direct conversion by overexpression of defined transcription factors (TFs) is a promising new method that can generate desired cell types from abundant, accessible cells. While previous studies have reported hepatic generation from fibroblasts, tremendous interest exists in the understanding of hepatic reprograming and its applicability in regenerative medicine. Here, we show that overexpression of Yamanaka factors can induce reprograming of mouse fibroblasts into cells that closely resemble hepatocytes in vitro in the presence of an optimized hepatic growth medium. By screening the effects of 20 candidate transcription factors, we identified a combination of three TFs (Hnf4a, Cebpa, and Nr1i2) that can convert fibroblasts into a hepatic fate. These factors in conjunction with Yamanaka factors increase the efficiency of hepatic reprograming. The induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells have multiple hepatocyte-specific characteristics; express hepatocyte-specific markers, glycogen storage, albumin secretion, urea production, as well as low-density lipoprotein and indocyanin green uptake. Production of iHep cells by these novel approaches may bring new insights into the molecular nature of hepatocyte differentiation and future cell-based therapeutics for liver diseases.

Abstract: Taliglucerase alfa is a plant cell–expressed beta-glucocerebrosidase approved in the United States, Israel, Australia, Canada, and other countries for enzyme replacement therapy in adults with Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD), for treatment of pediatric patients in the United States, Australia, and Canada, and for the hematologic manifestations of Type 3 GD in pediatric patients in Canada. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-dose, 12-month study assessed efficacy and safety of taliglucerase alfa in pediatric patients with GD. Eleven children were randomized to taliglucerase alfa 30U/kg (n=6) or 60U/kg (n=5) per infusion every other week. From baseline to month 12, the following changes were noted in the taliglucerase alfa 30-U/kg and 60-U/kg dose groups, respectively: median hemoglobin concentrations increased by 12.2% and 14.2%; the interquartile ranges of median percent change in hemoglobin levels from baseline were 20.6 and 10.4, respectively; mean spleen volume decreased from 22.2 to 14.0 multiples of normal (MN) and from 29.4 to 12.9 MN; mean liver volume decreased from 1.8 to 1.5 MN and from 2.2 to 1.7 MN; platelet counts increased by 30.9% and 73.7%; and chitotriosidase activity was reduced by 58.5% and 66.1%. Nearly all adverse events were mild/moderate, unrelated to treatment, and transient. One patient presented with treatment-related gastroenteritis reported as a serious adverse event due to the need for hospitalization for rehydration. No patient discontinued. These data suggest that taliglucerase alfa has the potential to be a therapeutic treatment option for children with GD. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01132690.

Role of AKT and ERK pathways in controlling sensitivity to ionizing radiation and adaptive response induced by low-dose radiation in human immune cells,

Abstract: Despite many studies of the effect of ionizing radiation, biological mechanisms of action might differ greatly depend on dose, dose rate, and cell type. This study was performed to explore the effects of low- and high-dose radiation in human immune cell lines. We examined cell sensitivity after irradiation with 0.05, 0.1, or 2Gy in two normal cell lines and three tumor cell lines. Low-dose radiation of 0.05 and 0.1Gy had no effect on cell survival in any tested cell line, with the exception of IM-9 cells, whose viability was transiently increased. However, IM-9 and C1R-sB7 cells were very sensitive to high-dose radiation-induced cell death, whereas Jurkat and JM1 cells showed moderate sensitivity, and THP-1 cells were completely resistant. This radiosensitivity was correlated with basal AKT activation, which is induced by phosphorylation. In radiosensitive IM-9 cells, priming with chronic low-dose irradiation blocked cell death induced by high-dose radiation challenge via inhibition of caspase activation and PARP cleavage. AKT phosphorylation was not altered in IM-9 cells, but ERK phosphorylation was greatly elevated immediately after chronic low-dose irradiation. Taken together, our results suggest that the different responses of normal and tumor cells to low-dose and high-dose radiation depend on AKT activation, which is regulated by protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A). In radiosensitive normal cells lacking basal AKT activity, chronic low-dose radiation increases activation of the ERK pathway, which plays an important role in the adaptive response to radiation, providing a very important insight into understanding the effects of ionizing radiation on health.

Abstract: Some myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients harbor JAK2V617F mutation, and CALR mutations were recently discovered in wild type (WT) JAK2V617F. We evaluated the frequency and type of CALR mutations, and clinical and hematological characteristics in WT JAK2V617F and MPLW515K/L MPN patients. Sixty-five patients were included: 21 with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 21 with myelofibrosis post-essential thrombocythemia (MPET) and 23 with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Screening for JAK2V617F and MPLW515K/L were performed using real-time PCR, while CALR mutations were analyzed by fragment analysis and Sanger sequencing. JAK2V617F was the most frequent mutation (54.5%) and one patient (1.5%) harbored MPLW515L. CALR mutations were present in 38.1% of PMF, 12.5% of ET and 33.3% of MPET patients. Five types of CALR mutations were detected, among which type 1 (32.1%) and type 2 (21.4%) were found to be the most common. A novel CALR mutation in a PMF patient was found. Patients carrying CALR mutations had higher platelet count and less presence of splenomegaly than JAK2V617F, while triple negatives had higher C-reactive protein levels than CALR mutant carriers. Screening for CALR mutations and its correlation with clinical features could be useful for the characterization of MPN patients and result in its incorporation into a new prognostic score.

Abstract: The formin homology domain-containing protein1 (FHOD1) suppresses actin polymerization by inhibiting nucleation, but bundles actin filaments and caps filament barbed ends. Two polyclonal antibodies against FHOD1 were generated against (i) its N-terminal sequence (residues 1–339) and (ii) a peptide corresponding the sequence from position 358–371, which is unique for FHOD1 and does not occur in its close relative FHOD3. After affinity purification both antibodies specifically stain purified full length FHOD1 and a band of similar molecular mass in homogenates of cardiac muscle. The antibody against the N-terminus of FHOD1 was used for immunostaining cells of established lines, primary neonatal (NRC) and adult (ARC) rat cardiomyocytes and demonstrated the presence of FHOD1 in HeLa and fibroblastic cells along stress fibers and within presumed lamellipodia and actin arcs. In NRCs and ARCs we observed a prominent staining of presumed intercalated discs (ICD). Immunostaining of sections of hearts with both anti-FHOD1 antibodies confirmed the presence of FHOD1 in ICDs and double immunostaining demonstrated its colocalisation with cadherin, plakoglobin and a probably slightly shifted localization to connexin43. Similarly, immunostaining of isolated mouse or pig ICDs corroborated the presence of FHOD1 and its colocalisation with the mentioned cell junctional components. Anti-FHOD1 immunoblots of isolated ICDs demonstrated the presence of an immunoreactive band comigrating with purified FHOD1. Conversely, an anti-peptide antibody specific for FHOD3 with no cross-reactivity against FHOD1 immunostained on sections of cardiac muscle and ARCs the myofibrils in a cross-striated pattern but not the ICDs. In addition, the anti-peptide-FHOD1 antibody stained the lateral sarcolemma of ARCs in a banded pattern. Double immunostaining with anti-cadherin and -integrin-ß1 indicated the additional localization of FHOD1 in costameres. Immunostaining of cardiac muscle sections or ARCs with antibodies against mDia3-FH2-domain showed colocalisation with cadherin along the lateral border of cardiomyocytes suggesting also its presence in costameres.

Abstract: 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a canonical member of a group of dioxins which are byproducts of industrial combustion and are dangerous environmental pollutants. TCDD has been shown to cause several abnormalities in humans and wildlife, and recently, some dioxins have been found to activate platelets. However, TCDD-mediated platelet activation pathways are elusive and virtually nothing is known about TCDD activation of fish thrombocytes. To investigate TCDD effect on thrombocyte function, we tested zebrafish blood in presence of TCDD using a thrombocyte functional assay. We found that TCDD activated thrombocytes. Further experiments showed that thrombocytes of fish treated with TCDD formed both aggregates and filopodia. To investigate the mechanism of TCDD-mediated activation of thrombocytes we used inhibitors for Gq, cyclooxygenase-1, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), c-src, Akt, and ERK1/2. We found that TCDD induces AHR which activates c-src and signals the activation of Akt and ERK1/2 which are ultimately involved in generation of thromboxane A2. Furthermore, we found that ADP potentiates TCDD action, which led to the discovery that ADP itself activates AHR in the absence of TCDD. Taken together, these results resolved the pathway of TCDD activation of thrombocytes and led to the finding that ADP is an activator of AHR.

Abstract: Mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase isoform 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) genes have been identified in glioblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, little is known about the molecular alterations of IDH genes in preleukemic disorders with a propensity to transform to AML. We performed polymerase chain reaction–denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (PCR–DHPLC) followed by direct sequencing to detect IDH mutations in 237 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs; n=108), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n=22), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH; n=41), and aplastic anemia (AA; n=66). No IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutations were identified in the entire cohort, whereas IDH1 G105G allele was detected in 4/108 MPN (3.70%), 2/22 MDS (9.09%), and 2/41 PNH (4.88%) patients. Three IDH2 R140Q mutations were found in 2/108 MPN (1.85%) and 1/22 MDS (4.54%) patients, while one IDH2 G145G allele was found in 0.92% (1/108) of MPN patients. Overall, our data suggest that IDH mutations are rare in the preleukemic disorders and may not be the major initial step in AML leukemogenesis.

Abstract: EZH2, a histone methyltransferase, is overexpressed in several human tumors, but whether it exerts any impact in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains unknown. We used real time PCR to investigate the expression profile of EZH1 and EZH2 in 59 CLL patients, 10 samples of purified B-cells from healthy donors and 12 normal adult tissues. EZH2 was overexpressed in CLL patients and correlates with high white blood cell count, ZAP-70 expression and chromosomal abnormalities. EHZ1 expression does not correlate with CLL progression. EZH2 overexpression is related to a poor prognosis of CLL and could be a useful tool to assess its aggressiveness.

Abstract: Human enteric α-defensins (HD5 and HD6), major antimicrobial peptides produced by Paneth cells in the intestine, play important roles in intestinal innate immunity. Since their expression is decreased in Crohn's disease (CD), with decreased expression being more pronounced in the presence of NOD2 mutations, it would be extremely interesting to investigate the mechanism by which NOD2 may regulate expression of human enteric α-defensins. Here we show that although NOD2 by itself can slightly up-regulate expression of enteric α-defensins mainly through activation of the NF-κB pathway, it can strongly down-regulates their expression during differentiation of the Paneth cell lineage mainly by inhibiting activation of the MAPK pathway. Since NOD2 is over-expressed in CD and mutant NOD2 cannot result in NF-κB activity, our finding can provide an explanation of the previous observation showing decreased expression of human enteric α-defensin in CD and even more so in the presence of NOD2 mutations. In addition, this finding provides a new view on the function of NOD2 in regulating intestinal innate immunity.

Abstract: We studied whether chemokines may have a role in relapses in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We compared the levels of chemokine receptors in marrow samples from 82 children with ALL at diagnosis versus 15 at relapses, and quantified the levels of chemokines in central system fluid (CSF) samples. The functional role of specific chemokines was studied in vitro and in vivo. The expression of some chemokine receptors was upregulated upon leukemic relapse, both in B- and in T-ALL, and in cases of medullary and extramedullary involvement. CXCL10 induced chemotaxis in leukemic cell lines and in primary leukemic cells, depending upon the levels of CXCR3 expression. CXCL10 specifically diminished chemotherapy-induced apoptosis on ALL cells expressing CXCR3, partially inhibiting caspase activation and maintaining the levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Finally, immunodeficient mice engrafted with CXCR3-expressing human leukemic cells showed decreased infiltration of marrow, spleen, and CNS after receiving a CXCR3-antagonist molecule. CXCR3 signaling in ALL may have a dual function: chemotactic for the localisation of leukemic blasts in specific niches, and it may also confer resistance to chemotherapy, enhancing the chances for relapses.

Abstract: Reduced or absent cytotrophoblast invasion of the maternal uterine spiral arterioles is a common clinical finding in studies of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, suggesting that the mechanisms mediating invasion of these cells is perturbed. The placenta initially develops in a low oxygen environment of 1–2% oxygen until after the 10th week of pregnancy. During this time oxygen concentration exerts a major influence over trophoblast activity and, hypoxia inducible factors are proposed to be one of many key regulators of first trimester trophoblast behaviour. We used a global gene expression microarray approach to identify signalling pathways and hypoxia-responsive genes of interest involved in invasion of the first trimester trophoblast cell line HTR8/SVneo under hypoxic conditions where HIF-1 was active. Additionally, first trimester placental samples from different gestational age groups were labelled with anti HIF-1α and HIF-2α to evaluate whether HIFs are differentially expressed and localised across two periods of placental development: (1) early first trimester characterised by hypoxia (6–8 weeks) and (2) late first trimester after initiation of maternal blood flow into the placenta (10–12 weeks). Invasion of HTR8/SVneo was assessed in real-time and was significantly increased in 1% compared with 5% and 21% oxygen and did not differ between 5% and 21% oxygen treatments. Eighty-eight genes were differentially expressed between cells cultured in 1% oxygen (where HIF-1α protein was localised to the nucleus) and 5% oxygen (where HIF-1α was mainly cytoplasmic). 65% of the genes were predicted to contain HIF-1α:HIF-1β transcription factor binding sites. While HIF-2α staining intensity in trophoblasts of late first trimester placenta was higher than early first trimester (+57%) the percentage of positively stained trophoblast nuclei did not differ between the two time points. There was no difference in the expression level of any of the hypoxia responsive genes of interest, IGFBP3, P4HA1, P4HA2, ANGPTL4 and MMP1 between early and late first trimester placenta. While HIF-1α and its downstream targets are clearly induced in HTR8/SVneo during in vitro hypoxic conditions, it appears that hypoxia inducible factors and genes are not altered throughout the first 7–12 weeks of placental development, during which the onset of maternal blood flow to the intervillous space takes place.

Abstract: PIP4K2A is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates PtdIns5P, generating PtdIns4,5P2. Recently, PIP4K2A was identified as a potential target in acute myeloid leukemia cells. The objective of the present study was to investigate the PIP4K2A expression in hematological malignancies and verify the effects of PIP4K2A silencing on proliferation and survival of leukemia cell lines. PIP4K2A was found to be a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein with reduced levels in leukemia cell lines compared to normal leukocytes. PIP4K2A mRNA levels were significantly reduced in bone marrow cells from acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) patients compared with healthy donors and in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ≥5% compared with <5% bone marrow blasts. Low PIP4K2A expression (lowest tertile versus 2 higher tertiles) negatively impacted overall survival of MDS patients by univariate analysis. PIP4K2A silencing did not modulate cell proliferation, clonogenicity and apoptosis of HEL and Namalwa leukemia cells. In summary, we characterized the expression of PIP4K2A in a cohort of patients with hematological malignancies and we found that PIP4K2A mRNA expression is downregulated in RAEB-1/RAEB-2 MDS and ALL cells, and PIP4K2A silencing does not modulate cell survival in HEL and Namalwa leukemia cells.

Abstract: India along with Nigeria and DRC contribute to 57% of the world sickle cell anemia population. The annual number of newborns in India with SCA was estimated at 44,000 in 2010. Even with this high prevalence there is minimal information about genetic factors that influence the disease course in Indian patients. The current study was conducted on 240 patients with SCD and 60 with sickle cell trait, to determine the association of genetic variants at the BCL11A (rs1427407) and HBS1-MYB (rs6934903) loci with fetal hemoglobin levels (HbF). Both these loci have been implicated with influencing HbF levels, a powerful modulator of the clinical and hematologic features of SCD. Our results indicate the BCL11A rs1427407 G>T variant to be significantly associated with HbF levels {19.12±6.61 (GG), 20.27±6.92 (GT) and 24.83±2.92 (TT) respectively} contributing to ~23% of the trait variance. Interestingly no association of the HBS1L-MYB rs6934903 with the HbF levels was seen. The present study indicates the BCL11A (rs1427407) but not HMIP (rs6934903) to be associated with elevated HbF levels in Indian patient. Further interrogation of additional variants at both the loci; as also a GWAS which may help uncover new loci controlling HbF levels.

Abstract: Introduction
Congenital dysfibrinogenemia (CD) is a rare qualitative disorder of fibrinogen (Fg) with heterogeneous clinical manifestations. We aimed to analyze clinical phenotype and molecular basis of 102 Chinese CD patients and to evaluate the application of thromboelastography (TEG).
Materials and methods
Clinical manifestations were recorded and quantified using the consensus ISTH bleeding assessment tool. Kaolin activated TEG and functional Fg TEG were applied in 30 patients. Genetic analysis of Fg genes were performed by direct sequencing.
Results
27.5% patients experienced bleeding, 3.9% had thrombosis and 68.6% were asymptomatic. Females were more prone to experience bleeding (P=0.01). Significant difference (P<0.05) in TEG results were found between patients with hot-spot mutations at AαArg35(16) and γArg301(275), but were not identified between patients with and without bleeding. Normal TEG results were found in patients with mutations at AαArg35(16), AαPro37(18) or AαArg38(19). Six novel mutations were identified, including AαGly33(14)del, AαAsp57(38)_Trp60(41)delIVS2+1_+2GTdel, AαPhe742(723)Tyr, γAsn334(308)Thr, γGly335(309)Cys and γTrp395(369)Leu.
Conclusions
CD patients have similar clinical manifestations and hot-spot mutations worldwide with no ethnic difference. TEG results could not indicate the bleeding risk in patients, but priority of mutation screening at thrombin cleavage site or polymerization site on Aа chain may be given if TEG results are normal.

Abstract: Voltage-gated calcium channel blockers are widely used for the management of cardiovascular diseases, however little is known about their effects on cardiac cells in vitro. We challenged neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes (CMs) with therapeutic L-type and T-type Ca2+ channel blockers (nifedipine and mibefradil, respectively), and measured their effects on cell stress and survival, using fluorescent microscopy, Q-PCR and Western blot. Both nifedipine and mibefradil induced a low-level and partially transient up-regulation of three key mediators of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), indicative of endoplasmic (ER) reticulum stress. Furthermore, nifedipine triggered the activation of macroautophagy, as evidenced by increased lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), decreased levels of polyubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1 and ubiquitinated protein aggregates, that was followed by cell death. In contrast, mibefradil inhibited CMs constitutive macroautophagy and did not promote cell death. The siRNA-mediated gene silencing approach confirmed the pharmacological findings for T-type channels. We conclude that L-type and T-type Ca2+ channel blockers induce ER stress, which is divergently transduced into macroautophagy induction and inhibition, respectively, with relevance for cell viability. Our work identifies VGCCs as novel regulators of autophagy in the heart muscle and provides new insights into the effects of VGCC blockers on CMs homeostasis, that may underlie both noxious and cardioprotective effects.

Abstract: DEK is important in regulating cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and maintenance of stem cell phenotype. The translocation t(6;9) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), which fuses DEK with NUP214, confers a poor prognosis and a higher risk of relapse. The over-expression of DEK in AML has been reported, but different studies have shown diminished levels in pediatric and promyelocytic leukemias. This study has characterized DEK expression, in silico, using a large multi-center cohort of leukemic and normal control cases. Overall, DEK was under-expressed in AML compared to normal bone marrow (NBM). Studying specific subtypes of AML confirmed either no significant change or a significant reduction in DEK expression compared to NBM. Importantly, the similarity of DEK expression between AML and NBM was confirmed using immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue mircorarrays. In addition, stratification of AML patients based on median DEK expression levels indicated that DEK showed no effect on the overall survival of patients. DEK expression during normal hematopoiesis did reveal a relationship with specific cell types implicating a distinct function during myeloid differentiation. Whilst DEK may play a potential role in hematopoiesis, it remains to be established whether it is important for leukemagenesis, except when involved in the t(6;9) translocation.

Abstract: Copy number variations (CNV) in CEBPA locus represent heterogeneous group of mutations accompanying acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aim of this study was to characterize different CEBPA mutation categories in regard to biological data like age, cytology, CD7, and molecular markers, and identify possible factors affecting their etiology. We report here the incidence of 12.6% of CEBPA mutants in the population of 262 normal karyotype AML (NK-AML) patients. We confirmed that double mutant AMLs presented uniform biological features when compared to single CEBPA mutations and accompanied mostly younger patients. We hypothesized that pathogenesis of distinct CEBPA mutation categories might be influenced by different factors. The detailed sequence analysis revealed frequent breakpoint-associated microhomologies of 2 to 12bp. The analysis of distribution of microhomology motifs along CEBPA gene showed that longer stretches of microhomology at the mutational junctions were relatively rare by chance which suggests their functional role in the CEBPA mutagenesis. Additionally, accurate quantification of CEBPA transcript levels showed that double CEBPA mutations correlated with high-level CEBPA expression, whereas single N-terminal CEBPA mutations were associated with low-level CEBPA expression. This might suggest that high-level CEBPA expression and/or accessibility of CEBPA locus contribute to B-ZIP in-frame duplications.

Abstract: Heat shock factor 4 (HSF4) is an important transcriptional factor that plays a vital role in lens development and differentiation, but the mechanism underlying the regulation of HSF4 is ambiguous. BCAS2 was reported to be an essential subunit of pre-mRNA splicing complex. Here, we identified BCAS2 as a novel HSF4 interacting partner. High expression of BCAS2 in the lens epithelium cells and the bow region of mouse lens was detected by immunohistochemistry. In human lens epithelial cells, BCAS2 negatively regulates HSF4 protein level and transcriptional activity, whereas in BCAS2 knockdown cells, HSF4 protein stability was increased significantly. We further demonstrated that the prolonged protein half-time of HSF4 in BCAS2 knockdown cells was due to reduced ubiquitination. Moreover, we have identified the lysine 206 of HSF4 as the key residue for ubiquitination. The HSF4-K206R mutant blocked the impact of BCAS2 on HSF4 protein stability. Taken together, we identified a pathway for HSF4 degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome system, and a novel function for BCAS2 that may act as a negative regulatory factor for modulating HSF4 protein homeostasis.

Abstract: Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans on stromal and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) help form the stem cell niche, co-localize molecules that direct stem cell fate, and modulate HSPC homing and retention. Inhibition of HS function mobilizes marrow HSPC. In vitro, HSPC maintenance is influenced by stromal HS structure and concentration. Because inhibition of HS activity or synthesis may be developed for HSPC transplantation, it is important to examine if systemic HS deficiency influences hematopoiesis in vivo. In a transgenic mouse model of HS haploinsufficiency, we examined endogenous hematopoiesis and engraftment of allogeneic bone marrow. Endogenous hematopoiesis was normal except gender-specific alterations in peripheral blood monocyte and platelet counts. Donor engraftment was achieved in all mice following myeloablative irradiation, but HS deficiency in the stromal microenvironment, on HSPC, or both (the 3 test conditions), was associated with a trend towards lower donor engraftment percentage in the bone marrow. Following non-myeloablative irradiation, competitive engraftment was achieved in 22% of mice in the test conditions, vs 50% of control animals (P=0.03). HS deficiency did not re-direct donor engraftment from bone marrow to spleen or liver. Normal HS levels in the stromal microenvironment and HSPC are required for HSPC engraftment following non-myeloablative conditioning.

Abstract: The true frequency of the JAK2 46/1 haplotype in patients of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) with CALR mutations was unknown. Totally 187 MPN cases with diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) were recruited. The frequency of 46/1 haplotype was significantly higher in JAK2V617F-positive PV (51%, p<0.001) and ET (41%, p=0.005) compared to normal controls. The exact location of JAK2V617F mutation was located at the cis-46/1 haplotype in 86.4% (32/37) PV patients and 87.5% (28/32) ET patients, respectively. Among the 51 patients of ET without JAK2V617F mutation, 38 (75%) patients harbored CALR mutations and 3 patients had MPL mutation. The frequency of 46/1 haplotype in the 38 ET patients with CALR mutations was 27%, which is not significantly different from that of normal control (p value=0.879). Compared to non-46/1 haplotype, the presence of 46/1 haplotype had a trend to have higher white blood cell count in JAK2V617F-mutated PV and ET patients but not in CALR-mutated ET. We conclude that the 46/1 haplotype could have functioning effect but only in the context of JAK2V617F mutation.

Abstract: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) support malignant hematopoiesis in CML. Conversely, the multi-functional BMP antagonist Gremlin1 supports self-renewing cancer stem cells of other malignancies. Inhibition of BMP signaling in CML, or of Gremlin1 in solid tumors, may therefore have therapeutic potential. However, since BMPs regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) decisions in the stem cell niche, it is necessary to determine how Gremlin1 influences normal HSC. We examined the effects of Gremlin1 on long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) and transplantable hematopoietic stem cells (SCID-repopulating cells: SRC) in human umbilical cord blood. Gremlin1 inhibited BMP signaling, downregulated BMP-6 and cyclin E2 expression and upregulated hairy and enhancer of split-1 (HES-1; a Notch transcriptional target) and Hedgehog interacting protein-1 (HHIP-1; an inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling). The functional effects of Gremlin1 on SRC, i.e. skewing of their myelopoietic:lymphopoietic potential towards B lymphopoiesis without affecting long-term engraftment potential, were entirely consistent with changes in gene expression induced by Gremlin1. Since both BMPs and Gremlin1 are secreted by osteoblasts in vivo, our studies provide potential insights into the molecular regulation of hematopoiesis in the stem cell niche. These results also suggest that Gremlin1 (and possibly its mimetics that may be developed for therapeutic use) may not adversely affect normal human hematopoietic stem cell survival, though they may reduce their myelopoietic potential.

Abstract: Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase belongs to the Nedd4 family of proteins, which affect a wide variety of processes in the cell. Here we document that Rsp5 shows several phosphorylated variants of different mobility and the migration of the phosphorylated forms of Rsp5 was faster for the tpk1Δ tpk3Δ mutant devoid of two alternative catalytic subunits of protein kinase A (PKA), indicating that PKA possibly phosphorylates Rsp5 in vivo. We demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of GFP-HA-Rsp5 protein using the anti-phospho PKA substrate antibody that Rsp5 is phosphorylated in PKA sites. Rsp5 contains the sequence 758-RRFTIE-763 with consensus RRXS/T in the catalytic HECT domain and four other sites with consensus RXXS/T, which might be phosphorylated by PKA. The strain bearing the T761D substitution in Rsp5 which mimics phosphorylation grew more slowly at 28°C and did not grow at 37°C, and showed defects in pre-tRNA processing and protein sorting. The rsp5-T761D strain also demonstrated a reduced ability to form colonies, an increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hypersensitivity to ROS-generating agents. These results indicate that PKA may downregulate many functions of Rsp5, possibly affecting its activity. Rsp5 is found in the cytoplasm, nucleus, multivesicular body and cortical patches. The rsp5-T761D mutation led to a strongly increased cortical localization while rsp5-T761A caused mutant Rsp5 to locate more efficiently in internal spots. Rsp5-T761A protein was phosphorylated less efficiently in PKA sites under specific growth conditions. Our data suggests that Rsp5 may be phosphorylated by PKA at position T761 and that this regulation is important for its localization and function.

Abstract: Changes in weight/height ratio, delayed sexual maturation, hypogonadism and impaired fertility have been demonstrated in sickle cell disease (SCD). This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and laboratory views of the Leydig cells function after stimulation with hCG in adults with sickle cell disease. We studied 15 patients with SCD (18 to 40years; median=27yearsold), fourteen homozygous S, and one with SC disease. The control group, composed by adult males, was divided into two groups: I — 10 relatives (18–39years, median=26years) with the same socioeconomic level of the patients, and II — 9 normal individuals (23–28, median=31years) randomly chosen. Clinically it was observed a slight degree of malnutrition, important puberty delay, rarefaction of chest, underarm and pubic hair, and important reduction of the testis and penis size, featuring a mild hypogonadism in patients with SCD. The hormonal level assessment of testosterone at baseline and at 24, 48 and 72h after hCG stimulation showed no significant differences between the groups studied. We can presume that adult men with SCD showed clinical hypoandrogenism with normal testicular hormonal function, a fact inconsistent with the hypothesis of primary hypogonadism.

Abstract: MXD3 is a transcription factor that plays an important role in proliferation of human DAOY medulloblastoma cells. Here, we demonstrate that MXD3 is highly enriched in human precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (preB ALL) samples compared to mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bone marrow, or hematopoietic stem cells from healthy donors. MXD3 knock-down in the preB ALL cell line Reh resulted in decreased cell numbers with no change in G0/G1, S or G2/M populations but increased apoptosis compared to control cells. Our results suggest that MXD3 is important for survival of Reh preB ALL cells, possibly as an anti-apoptotic factor.

Abstract: Chronic inflammation and reduced blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids (n−3) are known characteristics of sickle cell disease (SCD).The anti-inflammatory properties of n−3 fatty acids are well recognized. Omega-3 treated (n=24), hydroxyurea (HU) treated (n=18), and n−3 untreated (n=21) homozygous SCD patients (HbSS) and healthy (HbAA) controls (n=25) matched for age (5–16years), gender and socioeconomic status were studied. According to age (5–10) or (11–16) years, two or three capsules containing 277.8mg docosahexaenoic (DHA) and 39.0mg eicosapentaenoic (EPA) or high oleic acid placebo (41%) were assigned to n−3 treated and n−3 untreated groups, respectively. Hydroxyurea treated group was on dosage more than 20mg/kg/day. The effect of supplementation on systemic and blood cell markers of inflammation was investigated. The n−3 treated group had higher levels of DHA and EPA (p<0.001) and lower white blood cell count and monocyte integrin (p<0.05) compared with the n−3 untreated. No difference was detected between the two groups regarding C-reactive protein, granulocytes integrin and selectin, plasma tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-10. The n−3 treated group had lowered nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) gene expression compared to n−3 untreated and HU treated groups (p<0.05). This study provides evidence that supplementation with n−3 fatty acids may ameliorate inflammation and blood cell adhesion in patients with SCD.

Abstract: Reggies/flotillins are implicated in trafficking of membrane proteins to their target sites and in the regulation of the Rab11a-dependent targeted recycling of E-cadherin to adherens junctions (AJs). Here we demonstrate a function of reggies in focal adhesion (FA) formation and α5- and β1-integrin recycling to FAs. Downregulation of reggie-1 in HeLa and A431 cells by siRNA and shRNA increased the number of FAs, impaired their distribution and modified FA turnover. This was coupled to enhanced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rac1 signaling and gain in plasma membrane motility. Wild type and constitutively-active (CA) Rab11a rescued the phenotype (normal number of FAs) whereas dominant-negative (DN) Rab11a mimicked the loss-of-reggie phenotype in control cells. That reggie-1 affects integrin trafficking emerged from the faster loss of internalized antibody-labeled β1-integrin in reggie-deficient cells. Moreover, live imaging using TIRF microscopy revealed vesicles containing reggie-1 and α5- or β1-integrin, trafficking close to the substrate–near membrane and making kiss-and-run contacts with FAs. Thus, reggie-1 in interaction with Rab11a controls Rac1 and FAK activation and coordinates the targeted recycling of α5- and β1-integrins to FAs to regulate FA formation and membrane dynamics.

Hematological consequences of a FANCG founder mutation in Black South African patients with Fanconi anemia,

Abstract: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare disorder of DNA repair, associated with various somatic abnormalities but characterized by hematological disease that manifests as bone marrow aplasia and malignancy. The mainstay of treatment, in developed nations, is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with subsequent surveillance for solid organ and non-hematological malignancies. In South Africa, FA in the Black population is caused by a homozygous deletion mutation in the FANCG gene in more than 80% of cases. Many affected patients are not diagnosed until late in the disease course when severe cytopenia and bone marrow aplasia are already present. Most patients are not eligible for HSCT at this late stage of the disease, even when it is available in the state health care system. In this study, the hematological presentation and disease progression in 30 Black South African patients with FA, confirmed to have the FANCG founder mutation, were evaluated and compared to those described in other FA cohorts. Our results showed that patients, homozygous for the FANCG founder mutation, present with severe cytopenia but progress to bone marrow failure at similar ages to other individuals affected with FA of heterogeneous genotype. Further, the incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome is similar to that which has been previously described in other FA cohorts. Although severe cytopenia at presentation may be predicted by a higher number of somatic anomalies, the recognition of the physical FA phenotype in Black South African patients is challenging and may not be useful in expediting referral of suspected FA patients for tertiary level investigations and care. Given the late but severe hematological presentation of FA in Black South African patients, an investigative strategy is needed for earlier recognition of affected individuals to allow for possible HSCT and management of bone marrow disease.

Abstract: Polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells (PMNs) are known to spontaneously undergo apoptosis and then eliminated by professional phagocytes to prevent inflammation, a process called efferocytosis. However, when efferocytosis is impaired, PMNs will fall into secondary necrosis. Whether this state can persist for a certain period of time is unclear, since most of the studies investigating secondary necrosis are performed within 24h following induction by a proapoptotic agent. In this study, freshly isolated human PMNs were incubated without addition of exogenous agents in order to force them to undergo apoptosis and then secondary necrosis, an ideal experimental condition to study the behavior of secondary necrotic PMNs in absence of efferocytosis. By monitoring PMN cell morphology over time, we observed that an increasing proportion of cells harbored a ghost-like phenotype. Because these cellular remnants persist in plates for several days, we introduce here the terminology RIPs for ‘rest-in-plate’ structure. Heating of freshly isolated PMNs for 5min did not lead to the apparition of RIPs over time. In vivo administration of 7-days old RIPs in the murine air pouch model induced a slight inflammation resorbed within 24h. PKH26-stained RIPs were found to be ingested by professional phagocytes in vitro and in vivo in the murine air pouch and peritonitis models. Therefore, aged-PMNs have the potential to become RIPs in absence of efficient efferocytosis. Fortunately RIPs are recognized by professional phagocytes and, therefore, the concept of resolution of inflammation based on elimination of apoptotic and secondary necrotic PMNs could also be applied to RIPs.

Cross-talk between TLR4 and PPARγ pathways in the arachidonic acid-induced inflammatory response in pancreatic acini,

Abstract: Arachidonic acid (AA) is generally associated with inflammation in different settings. We assess the molecular mechanisms involved in the inflammatory response exerted by AA on pancreatic acini as an approach to acute pancreatitis (AP). Celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor), TAK-242 (TLR4 inhibitor) and 15d-PGJ2 (PPARγ agonist) were used to ascertain the signaling pathways. In addition, we examine the effects of TAK-242 and 15d-PGJ2 on AP induced in rats by bile-pancreatic duct obstruction (BPDO). To carry out in vitro studies, acini were isolated from pancreas of control rats. Generation of PGE2 and TXB2, activation of pro-inflammatory pathways (MAPKs, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT3) and overexpression of CCL2 and P-selectin was found in AA-treated acini. In addition, AA up-regulated TLR4 and down-regulated PPARγ expression. Celecoxib prevented the up-regulation of CCL2 and P-selectin but did not show any effect on the AA-mediated changes in TLR4 and PPARγ expression. TAK-242, reduced the generation of AA metabolites and repressed both the cascade of pro-inflammatory events which led to CCL2 and P-selectin overexpression as well as the AA-induced PPARγ down-regulation. Thus, TLR4 acts as upstream activating pro-inflammatory and inhibiting anti-inflammatory pathways. 15d-PGJ2 down-regulated TLR4 expression and hence prevented the synthesis of AA metabolites and the inflammatory response mediated by them. Reciprocal negative cross-talk between TLR4 and PPARγ pathways is evidenced. In vivo experiments showed that TAK-242 and 15d-PGJ2 treatments reduced the inflammatory response in BPDO-induced AP. We conclude that through TLR4-dependent mechanisms, AA up-regulated CCL2 and P-selectin in pancreatic acini, partly mediated by the generation of PGE2 and TXB2, which activated pro-inflammatory pathways, but also directly by down-regulating PPARγ expression with anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro and in vivo studies support the role of TLR4 in AP and the use of TLR4 inhibitors and PPARγ agonists in AP treatment.

Abstract: Calreticulin mutation represents the second most frequent mutation after JAK2 V617F in myeloproliferative disorder and is considered to be a driving mutation. Herein the mutation burden was evaluated in patients with essential thrombocythemia or myelofibrosis and found to increase by 5.7% over time unrelated to the time elapsed from the initial to the final positive test. The longer the course of the disease when first tested (range 0–30years, mean 7.9years) the lower mutation burden was observed. The mutated clone was larger in type II in comparison with type I mutation when first tested but the difference in mutation burden from the final to the first positive test was significantly higher in those with type I. Similarly, the difference in mutation burden was higher in patients with essential thrombocythemia reaching almost 8% in comparison to 1.3% in post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis. Thus a repeat calreticulin quantitative test is not warranted.

Abstract: The poor prognosis of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) indicates the existence of key candidate genes that affect pediatric ALL and its prognosis. The limma package in R was applied to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the Survival package and KMsurv package in R were used to screen disease free survival time related genes (prognosis genes). Then, based on latent pathway identification analysis (LPIA), latent pathways were identified, and pathway–pathway interaction network was constructed and visualized by Cytoscape. Based on the expression values of 8284 genes in 126 chips, 2796 DEGs and 353 prognosis genes were screened out. After overlapping DEGs and prognosis genes, 75 key genes were identified, which were most significantly enriched in 25 GO functions and chronic myeloid leukemia pathway. For the 75 key genes, 27 disease risk sub-pathways were identified, and HK3, HNMT, SULT2B1, KYNU, and PTGS2 were the significant key genes which were enriched in these sub-pathways. Furthermore, based on pathway–pathway interaction analysis, HK3 and PTGS2 were predicted as the most important genes. Through glycolysis and arachidonic acid metabolism, HK3 and PTGS2 might play important roles in pediatric ALL and its prognosis, and thus, might be potential targets for therapeutic intervention to suppress pediatric ALL.

Abstract: Arsenic trioxide has been proven to trigger apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Endoplasmic reticulum stress has been known to be involved in apoptosis through the induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein. However, it is unknown whether endoplasmic reticulum stress mediates arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our data showed that arsenic trioxide significantly induced apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Furthermore, arsenic trioxide triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress, as indicated by endoplasmic reticulum dilation, upregulation of glucose-regulated protein 78 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein. We further found that 4-phenylbutyric acid, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum stress, alleviated arsenic trioxide-induced expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein. More important, knockdown of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein by siRNA or inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress by 4-phenylbutyric acid alleviated apoptosis induced by arsenic trioxide. Consequently, our results suggested that arsenic trioxide could induce endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein might play an important role in this process.

Abstract: Sickle cell anemia (SCA), a disorder characterized by both acute and chronic inflammation, exhibits substantial phenotypic variability. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-6 are important in acute and chronic diseases, and their single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been considered as predictors of prognosis in several inflammatory conditions. This study aims at exploring possible association of IL-1β and IL-6 SNPs as potential genetic modifiers and or predictors of SCA clinical and laboratory phenotypes. This cross-sectional study involved 107 SCA patients and 110 age, sex and ethnicity-matched healthy individuals. The SNPs were identified by PCR-RFLP for IL-1β (−511C>T and +3954C>T) and IL-6 (−597G>A and −174G>C) genes. Associations between these SNPs and the clinical and laboratory profiles of patients with SCA were then determined. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of IL-1β and IL-6 SNPs between patients with SCA and controls were similar and followed HWE. IL-1β +3954C>T SNP was associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and lower absolute reticulocyte count, while IL-6 −597G>A was associated with higher likelihood of retinopathy and leg ulcer. These data indicate that IL-1β and IL-6 gene SNPs are associated with SCA complications among Brazilian patients and may act as genetic predictors of SCA clinical heterogeneity.

Abstract: There exists a general recognition of the fact that post translational modification of CYLD protein through proteolytic cleavage by MALT-1 results in sustained cellular NF-kB activity which is conspicuously found to be associated with cancer in general and hematological malignancies in particular. The present study was directed to understand the contribution of MALT-1 and deubiquitinase CYLD to the initiation of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Such a study revealed for the first time that the 35kDa CYLD cleaved factor generated by MALT-1 mediated proteolytic cleavage was conspicuously present in human T- ALL subjects of pediatric age group. Further, over-expression of this 35kDa CYLD factor within normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells had the inherent capacity to program the genome of these cells resulting in T-cell lineage ALL. Based upon these results, we propose that MALT1 inhibitors may be of crucial importance in the treatment of T-ALL subjects of pediatric age group.

Abstract: In this work, we investigated the influence of the mobility (μ) and the lifetime (τ) of charge carriers on the short-circuit current, the fill factor, and the efficiency of a bulk heterojunction solar cell based on a P3HT:PCBM biphasic film. Measurements of the photocurrent as a function of the applied voltage Jph(V), photo-CELIV, and the transient photovoltage (TPV) were carried out at different temperatures (100–340K). With the help of an analytical model for the photocurrent, we shed light on which recombination mechanism is dominant along the Jph(V) curve and quantitatively evaluated the impact of the μτ product on the cell parameters. We conclude that for voltages close to the open-circuit voltage, nongeminate recombination is the main loss factor in a bulk heterojunction solar cell, while as the photocurrent approaches its saturated value, the loss factor is essentially defined by the dissociation probability (P) of the charge transfer states (CTC states). Thermomechanical analysis (DMA) provided additional information about structural changes of the P3HT:PCBM active layer, which can be correlated with changes in the loss factor and in the cell parameters.

Abstract: CLL is characterized by extremely variable clinical course. Several prognostic factors can predict disease progression and therapeutic outcomes in those patients. The aim was to evaluate the use of CD49d and CD26 as independent prognostic markers in CLL patients. The present study measured surface expression of CD49d and CD26 by three-color flow cytometry in a series of 103 untreated CLL patients. We evaluated the prognostic role of CD49d and CD26 to predict the risk of lymphocyte doubling, disease progression and overall survival. We confirmed that CD49d and CD26 were significant predictors of lymphocyte doubling(P<0.001 for both markers) and disease progression (P<0.001 for both markers) but insignificant for overall survival(P=0.303 and 0.519 respectively. Multivariate analysis between clinical parameters and flow cytometry markers revealed that CD49d and CD26 are independent prognostic markers for lymphocyte doubling (HR=1.487 P=007 and HR=2.248, P=0.014 respectively) and progression to a more advanced stage (HR=3.191, P=0.049 and HR=7.887, P=0.003). Also, concordant expression of both markers was found to improve their predictive power. Many studies reported that CD49d and CD26 combined analysis was found to improve their power to predict the risk of lymphocyte doubling and disease progression.CD49d and CD26 have independent prognostic value and we suggest its use as a part of routine panel for prognostic stratification of CLL.

Abstract: Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), novel protein markers of oxidative damage, accumulate in the plasma of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Osteoporosis, which is closely related to the regulation of intestinal calcium transport channels (CTCs), is a prevalent extraintestinal complication of IBD and is associated with oxidative stress. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The present study aimed to verify whether AOPPs inhibit CTCs in the small intestinal epithelium and to identify the underlying mechanisms that may contribute to IBD-associated osteoporosis. Normal Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with AOPP-modified rat serum albumin. The calcium ion level in serum was not significantly altered, while the duodenal expression of CTCs (e.g. transient receptor potential vanilloid [TRPV6], calbindin-D9k [CaBP-D9k], plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1 [PMCA1], and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 1 [NCX1]) were decreased. In contrast, the levels of the related hormones that regulate calcium absorption including parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-(OH)D3, and 1,25-(OH)2D3 were increased, although the trend toward an increase in PTH levels was not significant. In order to further investigate the effects of AOPP exposure, we also evaluated the expression of CTCs (including the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel [CaV1.3], TRPV6, CaBP-D9k, PMCA1, and NCX1) in cultured human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2). The expression levels of total CTC protein and mRNA, except for CaV1.3, were significantly down-regulated in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was observed in vivo and in vitro. The p44/42 inhibitor U0126 reversed the down-regulation of CTCs induced by AOPPs in the Caco-2 monolayer. Our results indicate that AOPPs down-regulate the expression of CTCs through p44/42 MAPK signaling mechanisms in the small intestinal epithelium. These data provide new insights regarding the molecular basis of AOPP-induced reductions in intestinal CTCs, and are relevant to understanding the mechanisms of IBD-associated osteoporosis. Further studies are needed to explore these mechanisms in greater detail.

Abstract: Sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) develops in up to 30% of sickle cell disease patients (SCD) during the second decade of life. Treatment for this affection remains palliative, so studies on its pathophysiology may contribute to the future development of novel therapies. SCR is more frequently observed in hemoglobin SC disease and derives from vaso-occlusion in the microvasculature of the retina leading to neovascularization and, eventually, to blindness. Circulating inflammatory cytokines, angiogenic factors, and their interaction may contribute to the pathophysiology of this complication. Angiopoietin (Ang)-1, Ang-2, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, IL1-β, TNF-α, pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) and vascular endothelial growth factor plasmatic levels were determined in 37 SCD patients with retinopathy, 34 without retinopathy, and healthy controls. We observed that sICAM-1 is significantly decreased, whereas PEDF is elevated in HbSC patients with retinopathy (P=0.012 and P=0.031, respectively). Ang-1, Ang-2 and IL1-β levels were elevated in SCD patients (P=0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively), compared to controls, and HbSS patients presented higher levels of Ang-2 compared to HbSC (P<0.001). Our study supports the possible influence of sICAM-1 and PEDF on the pathophysiology of retinal neovascularization in SCD patients.

Abstract: Myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) functions in muscle-specific and/or growth factor-related transcription and is involved in cell growth, survival, and apoptosis. To evaluate the role of this transcription factor in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in diabetes mellitus, we performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. We used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to inhibit the expression of MEF2A in CFs in vitro. Inhibition of MEF2A significantly reduced hyperglycemia-induced CF proliferation and migration, myofibroblast differentiation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities, and collagen production. Furthermore, MEF2A inhibition attenuated HG-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Akt, and TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathways. For in vivo analysis in a mouse model, type-1 diabetes was induced by streptozotocinand MEF2A expression was knocked down by myocardial injection with lentivirus carrying shRNA-MEF2A. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. Total collagen deposition was assessed by Masson's trichrome and Picrosirius red staining. Knockdown of MEF2A ameliorated diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction and collagen deposition. Our study suggests that inhibition of MEF2A could alleviate HG-induced extracellular matrix accumulation by blocking the activation of Akt and TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway in CFs. Thus, inhibition of MEF2A has therapeutic potential in the treatment of diabetic-induced cardiac remodeling.

Abstract: We previously found that blood samples collected from steady-state patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) without exposure to air contain a new type of reversibly sickled cells (RSCs) with blunt edges at a level of as high as 78%. Since partial oxygenation of once-deoxygenated sickled cells with pointy edges to near venous oxygen pressure generates similar sickled cells with blunt edges in vitro, we named them as partially oxygenated sickled cells (POSCs). On the other hand, partial deoxygenation of once-oxygenated SS cells to venous oxygen pressure generates partially deoxygenated sickled cells (PDSCs) with pointy edges. In this study, we obtained blood samples from 6 steady-state patients with SCD under venous oxygen pressure without exposure to air, subjected them to various oxygenation/deoxygenation/reoxygenation cycles, and studied their filterability through a membrane filter with pore diameter of 3μm, the theoretical minimum diameter of a capillary. Our results indicated that discocytes, POSCs with blunt edges, and irreversibly sickled cells could deform and pass through the filter, while PDSCs with pointy edges were rigid and could not. The filterability of SS cells seems to be related to the length and amount of deoxy-hemoglobin S fibers in the cells.

Abstract: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by the accumulation of functionally abnormal, monoclonal B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen, resulting in a reduction count of normal immunocompetent cells and their impaired immune function. The defect in transmission of signals from various types of extracellular receptors, leading to aberrant cytokines and transcription factors gene expression, may underlie the basis of immune failure in B-CLL. The aim of the study was to assess of IL-6, IL-10, c-Jun, and STAT3 expression. In response to antigenic stimulation IL-6, IL-10, c-Jun, and STAT3 proteins induce mutual activity. The subject of the study was subpopulations of leukemic lymphocytes (CD5+ CD19+) and CD19+ B cells from healthy donors (control group). Our results provide evidence that the regulation of IL-6, IL-10, c-Jun, and STAT3 gene expression in CLL B cells is clearly different from normal B lymphocytes. In B-CLL STAT3 expression in unstimulated lymphocytes is significantly higher (p<0.0001) compared with normal subpopulation of B cell. In contrast, IL-6, IL-10, and c-Jun mRNA expressions are statistically lower in B-CLL in comparison with the control group, in all cases (p<0.0001). When analyzing the relationship between c-Jun expression and B-CLL stage according Rai we revealed decreasing c-Jun expression, both at the mRNA and protein levels, along with advancing stage of disease.

Abstract: Chronic inflammation is often linked to the presence of type 2-polarized macrophages, which are induced by the T helper type 2 cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 (IL-13). IL-13 is a key mediator of tissue fibrosis caused by T helper type 2-based inflammation. Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. This study investigated the priming effect of granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on IL-13 expression by macrophages stimulated with HNE. Adherent macrophages were obtained from primary cultures of human mononuclear cells. Expression of IL-13 mRNA and protein by GM-CSF-dependent macrophages was investigated after stimulation with HNE, using the polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. GM-CSF had a priming effect on IL-13 mRNA and protein expression by macrophages stimulated with HNE, while this effect was not observed for various other cytokines. GM-CSF-dependent macrophages showed a significant increase in the expression of protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) mRNA and protein. The response of IL-13 mRNA to HNE was significantly decreased by pretreatment with alpha1-antitrypsin, a PAR-2 antibody (SAM11), or a PAR-2 antagonist (ENMD-1068). These findings suggest that stimulation with HNE can induce IL-13 production by macrophages, especially GM-CSF-dependent macrophages. Accordingly, neutrophil elastase may have a key role in fibrosis associated with chronic inflammation.

In this context, the study reported here revealed for the first time that cooperativity between Apoptosis Antagonizing Transcription Factor (AATF) mRNA and miR-2909 within cellular AATF RNome ensures the regulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) expression in a cyclic fashion and this phenomenon is substantiated when the immune cells face high glucose threat.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial growth factor type A (VEGFA) is a key regulator of angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are able to secrete VEGFA and express VEGFA receptors, thus it can be hypothesized that VEGFA-mediated signaling influences CLL clone survival. In this case–control study we verified whether inherited differences in activities of VEGFA and its main receptor VEGFR2 impact predisposition to CLL or the course of the disease. Four functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including two SNPs in VEGFA gene, namely rs2010963 (+405G>C) and rs3025039 (+936C>T) and two SNPs in VEGFR2 gene including rs7667298 (−271G>A) and rs1870377 (+1719A>T) were genotyped using PCR-based assays in 223 Caucasian CLL patients and 150 matched controls. Regarding VEGF rs2010963 SNP, we observed an association between CLL and allele C distribution with an OR of 1.52 (95% CI, 1.002–2.312), p=0.04. The distribution of other genotypes and alleles was similar in CLL and control groups. No genotype or allele was significantly associated with important prognostic factors in CLL including clinical stage, IgVH mutational status, ZAP-70 expression and FISH cytogenetic abnormalities. In conclusion, the results of our study indicate that genetic polymorphisms in VEGFA mediated pathway may influence the susceptibility to CLL.

Abstract: Background
Radioactive synoviorthesis was carried out by an injection of radioactive materials into the joint that has been known as a successful alternative treatment to invasive surgical synovectomy. This study was designed to evaluate short-term and long-term results and complications of radioactive synovectomy of hemophilic arthropathy using radioactive phosphorus.
Materials and methods
This study was conducted on 40 patients with hemophilic arthropathy. After obtaining clotting factors, the intra-articular injections of radioactive phosphorus were done. Thirteen patients were evaluated during 36months (short-term follow-up) and 27 patients were followed up for more than 36months (long-term follow-up). Patients were evaluated for hemarthrosis, factor consumption per month, joint range of motion (ROM) and clinical and radiological involvement grade.
Results
The patients mean age was 22.9±6.6 and there were 38 men and 2 women. Consumption of clotting factors was significantly reduced in the short-term follow-up of patients (p<0.05), but there was no significant difference in the long-term follow-up (p>0.05). ROM decreased significantly in the long-term follow-up (p<0.05). Radiologic evaluation showed significantly increased involvement in their joints (p<0.05).
Conclusion
Using radioactive synoviorthesis led in decreased consumption of clotting factors and the hemarthrosis incidence in short term but it did not have significant impact on clinical situation (ROM) and radiological findings of hemophilic patients in long-term follow-up.

Abstract: Objective
In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), simultaneous expression of proliferative (FLT3, KIT) and anti-apoptotic genes (BCL2) is unknown. The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate proliferative and anti-apoptotic gene transcripts, their interrelationship and impact on the outcome in pediatric AML patients.
Methods
We assessed proliferative and anti-apoptotic gene transcripts by Q-polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan probe) in 64 consecutive pediatric AML patients. Survival data was analyzed by Kaplan–Meier curves followed by log rank test to compare statistical significance between groups. Stepwise multivariable Cox regression method was used to evaluate independent prognostic factors.
Results
In univariate analysis, transcript ratio of FLT3/BCL2 and FLT3+KIT/BCL2 significantly predicted event free survival (EFS) (<0.01 and <0.01 respectively) and overall survival (OS) (<0.01 and<0.01 respectively). In stepwise Cox-regression model, high white blood cell count and high FLT3+KIT/BCL2 ratio predicted EFS (HR: 2.2 and 2.3); high hemoglobin and high FLT3+KIT/BCL2 ratio predicted OS (HR: 0.45 and 3.85). Prognostic index (PI) was calculated using the hazard coefficient of independent prognostic factors; at 57.3months, predicted OS of patients with the highest PI of 1.8 was 8% versus 73% for the lowest PI of −0.3. The mean PI of patients who died was 1.8±0.72 versus 0.54±0.70 for those who are alive, P=0.004.
Conclusions
This first study showed that individual expression of proliferative and anti-apoptotic transcripts is not as important in AML patients, rather their interrelationship and relative level probably determines the outcome.

Abstract: Associating the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with genetic predisposition is still a challenge. Here, we discuss two non-twinned sibs (girl and boy) diagnosed with B-cell precursor (BCP-ALL) and ETV6-RUNX1. BCP-ALL clinical onset occurred 10months apart from each diagnosis. One child is alive in complete continuous remission, whereas, the other relapsed and evolved to death with resistance to ALL treatment. Despite the fact that BCP-ALL with ETV6-RUNX1 usually results in a very good prognosis, the sibs experienced divergent outcomes; a remarkable difference in one child that presented a more aggressive disease was higher leukocytosis associated with IKZF1 deletion. The familial history of cancer and genetic susceptibility was explored. The sibs were absolutely identical in all 17 loci of genes tested; GSTM1, GSTT1, NQO1, TP53, and TP63 were wild-type, whereas at least one copy of the variant allele for IKZF1, ARID5B, PTPRJ and CEBPE was present. The familial pattern of ETV6 was tested by the 12p microsatellite analysis and demonstrated that deletions occurred in one child but not the other, while heterozygous patterns were found in the parents. Altogether, our data suggest that genetic predisposition aligned with chance haa an additive effect in BCP-ALL outcome.

Abstract: The most frequently hypothesized cause of unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) refers to a defective maternal haemostatic response leading to uteroplacental thrombosis. Approximately 20% women suffering from pregnancy loss (PL) are associated with autoimmune disorders and more than 50% remain idiopathic after common traditional investigations. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of different genetic and acquired thrombophilia markers in a large series of Indian women with RPL. Such studies will help analyze the markers which pose maximum risk and help in the appropriate treatment in subsequent pregnancies. The study comprised of 587 women with no apparent etiological causes of RPL and 115 healthy women controls. p values were calculated with two tailed Fisher's exact test; statistical significance was assumed at p<0.05, 95% confidence interval. Relative risks were also calculated. Among genetic thrombophilia, the risk of PL was highest with protein S deficiency (16%, p=0.006) followed by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 4G/4G (23%, p=0.007) polymorphism. Among acquired markers, the risk of PL was the highest in women with anti-cardiolipin antibodies (24%, p=0.0001), followed by anti-annexin V antibodies (23%, p=0.0009) and lupus anticoagulants (8%, p=0.02). Thrombophilia, inherited and acquired, is an important contributing factor in unexplained RPL and should be screened in the order of its prevalence.

Abstract: Diverse subcellular localizations of the huntingtin-containing inclusion bodies are frequently suspected of reflecting crucial divisions between different cellular pathways contributing to the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease. Here, we use a panel of different N-terminal huntingtin fragments overexpressed in transfected neuronal and non-neuronal cells to demonstrate that it is the length of the N-terminal huntingtin fragments rather than a presence of any specific amino acid sequences that determines the ratio between the nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Importantly, the length of those fragments does also seem to strongly influence the folding of the aggregating huntingtin species, as indicated by the apparent differences in their accessibility for different antibodies directed against particular subdomains within the N-terminal part of huntingtin, although these differences do not correlate with the peptides’ ability to efficiently aggregate within the cell nucleus. Furthermore, the relatively long huntingtin fragment containing 588 amino acids of the reference sequence shows intracellular behavior that is substantially different from that exhibited by its shorter counterparts (containing either 171, 120, 89 or 64 amino acids), as this rarely aggregating peptide is not only accumulating in cytoplasmic inclusions of slightly different morphology but is also most strongly affected by the FLAG-tagging procedure that unexpectedly induces (or enhances) autophagy-related processes. Together, our results reveal a significant heterogeneity of the huntingtin accumulation patterns that are observed at the cellular level. These patterns are not only strongly dependent on both the length and the amino acid composition of the N-terminal huntingtin peptides but also seem to engage different cellular mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease, including the non-proteasomal degradation of potentially toxic huntingtin forms.

Suppression of centrosome protein TACC3 induces G1 arrest and cell death through activation of p38–p53–p21 stress signaling pathway,

Abstract: The centrosome regulates diverse cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. TACC3, a member of the human transforming acidic coiled-coil protein family, is a key centrosomal protein that is up-regulated in many cancers. Previous studies have demonstrated that TACC3 is essential for the survival of vertebrates and is involved in cell cycle regulation in human cells. However, the details of the underlying mechanisms in its cell cycle regulatory activity remain poorly understood. In this study, we showed that suppression of TACC3 expression induced G1 cell cycle arrest and triggered cell death in human cells. TACC3 depletion-induced G1 arrest and cell death were significantly reduced in cells either lacking p53 or with pharmacologically-inhibited p38, indicating that G1 arrest and cell death induction both require p53 and p38. TACC3 depletion up-regulated the levels of p53 and p21 and induced the accumulation of p53 both in the nucleus and at the centrosome. Interestingly, TACC3 depletion led to the activation of p38 and stimulated the recruitment of activated p38 to the centrosome. Depletion of TACC3 up-regulated the phosphorylation of p53 at Serine 33, a site known to be phosphorylated by p38 under cellular stress and further induced the accumulation of phosphorylated p53 to the centrosome. Loss of TACC3 affected centrosome integrity by disrupting the localization of components of the γ-tubulin ring complex at the centrosome. The results demonstrate that TACC3 depletion induces G1 arrest and cell death by activating p38–p53–p21 signaling and triggering a centrosome-mediated cellular stress response.

Abstract: The fungus Ustilago maydis is a pathogen that establishes a biotrophic interaction with Zea mays. The interaction with the plant host is largely governed by more than 300 novel, secreted protein effectors, of which only four have been functionally characterized. Prerequisite to examine effector function is to know where effectors reside after secretion. Effectors can remain in the extracellular space, i.e. the plant apoplast (apoplastic effectors), or can cross the plant plasma membrane and exert their function inside the host cell (cytoplasmic effectors). The U. maydis effectors lack conserved motifs in their primary sequences that could allow a classification of the effectome into apoplastic/cytoplasmic effectors. This represents a significant obstacle in functional effector characterization. Here we describe our attempts to establish a system for effector classification into apoplastic and cytoplasmic members, using U. maydis for effector delivery.

Abstract: Leukocyte adhesion deficiency 1 (LAD-1) is caused by defects in the β2 integrin subunit. We studied 18 missense mutations, 14 of which fail to support the surface expression of the β2 integrins. Integrins with the β2-G150D mutation fail to bind ligands, possibly due to the failure of the α1 segment of the βI domain to assume an α-helical structure. Integrins with the β2-G716A mutation are not maintained in their resting states, and the patient has the severe phenotype of LAD-1. The β2-S453N and β2-P648L mutants support the expression of integrins and adhesion functions. They should be re-classified as polymorphic variants.

Abstract: Background
Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality and one of the main causes of morbidity in β-thalassemia. Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, is a marker of ineffective erythropoiesis in several anemias.
Aim
To determine GDF-15 levels in children and adolescents with TI and the relation to hemolysis, iron overload and cardiovascular complications.
Methods
GDF-15 was measured in 35 TI patients without symptoms for heart disease and correlated to echocardiographic parameters and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT).
Results
GDF-15 levels were significantly higher in TI patients compared with controls (p<0.001). Transfusion dependent patients had higher GDF-15 than non-transfusion dependent patients. TI patients with splenectomy, pulmonary hypertension risk, and heart disease had higher GDF-15 levels than those without. GDF-15 was lower among hydroxyurea-treated patients. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that transfusion index (p=0.012), serum ferritin (p<0.001), tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (p<0.001), ejection fraction (p=0.01) and CIMT (p=0.007) were independently related to GDF-15. According to ROC curve analysis, the cutoff value of GDF-15 at 1500pg/mL could differentiate patients with and without heart disease.
Conclusion
GDF-15 would identify TI patients at increased risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications as well as subclinical atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is a severe complication associated with sickle cell anemia. Abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) identifies some children at high risk, but other markers would be helpful. This cohort study was aimed at evaluating the effects of genetic biomarkers on the risk of developing CVD in children from Minas Gerais, Brazil. Clinical and hematological data were retrieved from children's records. Outcomes studied were overt ischemic stroke and CVD (overt ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, abnormal TCD, or abnormal cerebral angiography). Out of 411 children, 386 (93.9%) had SS genotype, 23 (5.6%) had Sβ0-thal and two had severe Sβ+-thal (0.5%). Frequency of CVD was lower in Sβ-thal group (p=0.05). No effect of VCAM-1 polymorphism on stroke or CVD risks was detected. Cumulative incidence of stroke was significantly higher for children with TNF-α A allele (p=0.02) and lower for children with HBA deletion (p=0.02). However, no association between CVD and TNF-α -308G>A was found. CVD cumulative incidence was significantly lower for children with HBA deletion (p=0.004). This study found no association between VCAM1 c.1238G>C and stroke. An association between stroke and TNF-α -308A allele has been suggested. Our results have confirmed the protective role of HBA deletion against stroke and CVD.

Abstract: Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) holds a unique phylogenetic position at the base of the mammalian lineage due to an amalgamation of mammalian and sauropsid-like features. Here we describe the set of four lamin genes for platypus. Lamins are major components of the nuclear lamina, which constitutes a main component of the nucleoskeleton and is involved in a wide range of nuclear functions. Vertebrate evolution was accompanied by an increase in the number of lamin genes from a single gene in their closest relatives, the tunicates and cephalochordates, to four genes in the vertebrate lineage. Of the four genes the LIII gene is characterized by the presence of two alternatively spliced CaaX-encoding exons. In amphibians and fish LIII is the major lamin protein in oocytes and early embryos. The LIII gene is conserved throughout the vertebrate lineage, with the notable exception of marsupials and placental mammals, which have lost the LIII gene. Here we show that platypus has retained an LIII gene, albeit with a significantly altered structure and with a radically different expression pattern. The platypus LIII gene contains only a single CaaX-encoding exon and the head domain together with coil 1a and part of coil1b of the platypus LIII protein is replaced by a novel short non-helical N-terminus. It is expressed exclusively in the testis. These features resemble those of male germ cell-specific lamins in placental mammals, in particular those of lamin C2. Our data suggest (i) that the specific functions of LIII, which it fulfills in all other vertebrates, is no longer required in mammals and (ii) once it had been freed from these functions has undergone structural alterations and has adopted a new functionality in monotremes.

Abstract: As renal dysfunction is a leading cause of morbidity in sickle cell disease it is important that clinicians have accurate means of assessing its risk and severity. Cystatin C (Cys-C) is being recognized as a useful marker of renal function in other populations and this study aims to determine its utility in adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA). 98 persons with the homozygous SS disease (55 females: 43 males; mean age 34±2.3years) had hematological and biochemical, including Cys-C, measurements; and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measured using a 99mTc-DTPA nuclear renal scan. The measured GFR was 94.9±27.4mL/min/1.73m2, and mean Cys-C level was 0.80±0.78mg/L. Cys-C was significantly correlated with measured GFR (r=−0.61), hemoglobin (r=−0.32), serum creatinine (r=0.91), urine ACR (r=0.79), and systolic blood pressure (r=0.38). The Cys-C based CKD-EPI showed the greatest agreement than the other commonly used Cys-C based as well as the serum creatinine based MDRD and CKD-EPI equations. Cys-C also showed a strong association with GFR in a significant regression model. In conclusion, Cys-C has shown strong associations with GFR and albuminuria among patients with SCA and so may be a useful screening tool in this patient population.

Abstract: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have an important role in antimicrobial innate immunity and release substances that may modulate the immune response. We investigated the effects of soluble factors from NETs and neutrophil granule proteins on human monocyte function by using the Transwell system to prevent cell–cell contact. NET formation was induced by exposing human neutrophils to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). When monocytes were incubated with PMA alone, expression of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA was upregulated, but IL-10, IL-12, and interferon (IFN)-gamma mRNA were not detected. Incubation of monocytes with NETs enhanced the expression of IL-10 and IFN-gamma mRNA, but not IL-12 mRNA. Myeloperoxidase stimulated IFN-gamma production by monocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Both a nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitor (PDTC) and an intracellular calcium antagonist (TMB-8) prevented upregulation of IFN-gamma production. Neither a combined p38alpha and p38beta inhibitor (SB203580) nor an extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor (PD98059) suppressed IFN-gamma production. Interestingly, a combined p38gamma and p38delta inhibitor (BIRB796) significantly decreased IFN-gamma production. These findings suggest that myeloperoxidase induces IFN-gamma production by monocytes via p38gamma/delta mitogen-activated protein kinase.

Abstract: A switching of reflectivity with temperature can be achieved in the infrared region, using thermally activated charge carriers in a single semiconductive layer on a reflective base material, when the interference effect between front and back side of the layer is used. We outline, how a surprisingly small change in conductivity – of less than an order of magnitude – changes the reflectivity more than 60% when the semiconductive material is tailored to its task regarding its activation energy and charge carrier density. As a proof of principle, titanium oxynitride layers were prepared on aluminum. A change of reflectivity of 21% was achieved when the sample temperature was increased from 25°C to 150°C, and a change of 34% when the sample was heated to 250°C.

Abstract: The oncogenic potential of APOBEC3G gene was recently appreciated by the finding that revealed inhibitory influence of APOBEC3G upon micro-RNA mediated repression of the gene responsible for hepatic metastasis. Here we report for the first time that sustained APOBEC3G expression is the characteristic trait exhibited by various cancer cells of different tissue origins as well as APOBEC3G represses cellular gene coding for tumor suppressor KLF4 by binding to its mRNA. This phenomenon was paralleled by the sustained expression of the cellular SP1 which ensured overexpression of genes coding for c-myc, Bmi-1, BCL-2 and MDM2 coupled with downregulation of tumor suppressor p53 thereby creating a favorable situation for oncogenic transformation.

Abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) are key initiators and regulators of the immune response. The development of the DC lineage and their subsets requires an orchestrated regulation of their transcriptional program. Gata1, a transcription factor expressed in several hematopoietic cell lineages, has been recently reported to be required for mouse DC development and function. In humans, GATA1 is involved in the lineage separation between monocyte-derived DCs and Langerhans cells (LC) and loss of GATA1 results in differentiation arrest at the monocyte stage. The hematopoietic GATA factors (i.e. Gata1, Gata2, Gata3) are known to regulate each other's expression and to function consecutively throughout lineage commitment (so-called GATA switch). In humans, mutations in GATA2 are causative of MonoMAC disease, a human immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by loss of DCs, monocytes, B and NK cells. However, additional data on the expression of hematopoietic GATA factors in the DC lineage is missing. In this study, we have characterized the expression of hematopoietic GATA factors in murine and human DCs and their expression dynamics upon TLR stimulation. We found that all hematopoietic GATA factors are expressed in DCs, but identified species-specific differences in the relative expression of each GATA factor, and how their expression fluctuates upon stimulation.

Abstract: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare congenital immune deficiency caused by mutations in any of the five genes encoding NADPH oxidase subunits. One of these genes is NCF1, encoding the p47phox protein. A group of 39 patients, 14 of whom are of Kavkazi Jewish descent, was investigated for a founder effect for the mutation c.579G>A (p.Trp193Ter) in NCF1. We analyzed various genetic markers in the NCF1 region, including two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NCF1 and two short tandem repeats (STRs) located near NCF1. Most patients were homozygous for the c.579G>A mutation, but three patients were hemizygotes, with a deletion of NCF1 on the other allele, and three patients were compound heterozygotes with another mutation in NCF1. All Kavkazi Jewish patients had a c.295G_c.345T SNP combination in NCF1 and shared a common number of repeats in STR3. In addition, 90% of the Kavkazi Jewish patients shared a common number of repeats in STR1. This uniformity indicates that the c.579G>A mutation in NCF1 was introduced some 1200–2300years ago in the Kavkazi Jewish population. Variation amongst the other investigated populations from the Middle East indicates that this mutation exists in these non-Kavkazi populations already for more than 5000years.

Abstract: Heterogeneity in thalassemia is due to various modifying factors viz. coinheritance of α-gene defects, abnormal hemoglobin, XmnI polymorphism, variation in repeat sequences present in LCR, and silencer region of the gene. The present work on populations from eastern regions of India was undertaken to study the genetic profile of heterogeneity in thalassemia patients. Mutation analysis in 126 index families revealed the presence of 3 novel mutations: CD2 (−A) in the 1st exon, −42 (C–G), and −223 (T–C) in the promoter region of β-globin gene. The modifying effect of coexisting α-gene defects, and abnormal Hb (HbS) was clearly observed in our study, however ameliorating effect of T allele of XmnI polymorphism was not found. Analysis of the regulatory regions (LCR) exhibited new combinations (CA15TA5 and CA13TA8) in HS1 region and one (AT)10T3 in (AT)xTy silencer region. Thus disparate factors, when considered together, were able to explain several of the thalassemic phenotypes, otherwise not explained by the β globin mutations. However, there were still some cases in this group whose molecular origin could not be ascertained. Our findings confirm not only the extensive genotypic and clinical heterogeneity in β thalassemia but also the need to look for more modulators and modifiers to better understand the genotype–phenotype correlation in thalassemia.

Abstract: Humans and mice with sickle cell disease (SCD) have rigid red blood cells (RBCs). Omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexanoic acid (DHA), may influence RBC deformability via incorporation into the RBC membrane. In this study, sickle cell (SS) mice were fed natural ingredient rodent diets supplemented with 3% DHA (DHA diet) or a control diet matched in total fat (CTRL diet). After 8weeks of feeding, we examined the RBCs for: 1) stiffness, as measured by atomic force microscopy; 2) deformability, as measured by ektacytometry; and 3) percent irreversibly sickled RBCs on peripheral blood smears. Using atomic force microscopy, it is found that stiffness is increased and deformability decreased in RBCs from SS mice fed CTRL diet compared to wild-type mice. In contrast, RBCs from SS mice fed DHA diet had markedly decreased stiffness and increased deformability compared to RBCs from SS mice fed CTRL diet. Furthermore, examination of peripheral blood smears revealed less irreversibly sickled RBCs in SS mice fed DHA diet as compared to CTRL diet. In summary, our findings indicate that DHA supplementation improves RBC flexibility and reduces irreversibly sickled cells by 40% in SS mice. These results point to potential therapeutic benefits of dietary omega-3 fatty acids in SCD.

Abstract: The biological activity of a recombinant protein is routinely measured using a bioassay such as an enzyme assay. However, many proteins have no enzymatic activity and in many cases it is difficult to devise a simple and reliable approach to test their activity. Semaphorins, Ephrins, Slits, Netrins or amylin-assisted proteins have numerous activities affecting many systems and cell types in the human body. Most of them are also able to induce rapid cytoskeleton changes at least in some cell types. We assumed therefore, that such proteins might be tested based on their ability to modulate the cytoskeleton. Here we tested a number of semaphorins in an impedance based label-free platform that allows for dynamic monitoring of subtle morphological and adhesive changes. This system has proved to be a very fast, sensitive and effective way to monitor and determine the activity of such proteins. Furthermore we showed that it is possible to customize a cell-protein system by transfecting the cells with specific receptors and test the cell response following the addition of the recombinant ligand protein. Since other protein families such as Ephrins and Netrins can also influence the cytoskeleton of some cells, this approach may be applicable to a large number of proteins.

Abstract: Centrosome cohesion maintains centrosomes in close proximity until mitosis, when cell cycle-dependent regulatory signaling events dissolve cohesion and promote centrosome separation in preparation for bipolar spindle assembly at mitosis. Cohesion is regulated by the antagonistic activities of the mitotic NIMA-related kinase 2 (Nek2), protein phosphatase 1, the cohesion fiber components rootletin, centrosomal Nek2-associated protein 1 (C-Nap1) and Cep68. The centrosomal protein Cep68 is essential for centrosome cohesion and dissociates from centrosomes at the onset of mitosis. Here, our cell line studies show the C-terminal 300–400 amino acids of Cep68 are necessary to localize Cep68 to interphase centrosomes while C-terminal 400–500 amino acids might regulate Cep68 dissociation from centrosomes at mitotic onset. In addition, Nek2 was demonstrated to phosphorylate Cep68 in vivo and this phosphorylation appears to promote Cep68 degradation in mitosis. We further show that the SCF complex destroys Cep68 at mitosis through recognition by the beta-Trcp F box component of SCF. Together, the findings provide a new insight into the control of centrosome separation by Cep68 during mitosis.

Abstract: Several chromosomal rearrangements involving band 3q26 are known to induce EVI1 overexpression. They include inv(3)(q21q26), t(3;3)(q21;q26), t(3;21)(q26;q22) and t(3;12)(q26;p13). Translocations involving the short arm of chromosome 2 and 3q26 have been reported in more than 50 patients with myeloid disorders. However, although the breakpoints on 2p are scattered over a long segment, their distribution had only been analyzed in 9 patients. We performed fluorescent in situ hybridization with a library of BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) clones in 4 patients with t(2;3)(p15–23;q26). Our results combined with those of the 9 previously reported patients showed scattering of the breakpoints in 2 regions. A 1.08Mb region in band 2p21 encompassing the MTA3, ZFP36L2 and THADA genes was documented in 5 patients. A second region of 1.83Mb in band 2p16.1 was identified in 8 patients. Four patients showed clustering around the BCL11A gene and the remaining 4 around a long intergenic non-coding RNA, FLJ30838. These regions are characterized by the presence of regulatory sequences (CpG islands and promoters) that could be instrumental in EVI1 overexpression.

Abstract: Thalassemia major is characterized by anemia, iron overload and cellular damage. The severity of symptoms correlates with the alpha/non-alpha globin imbalance and is proportional to the magnitude of alpha chain excess. Alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP), the erythroid specific alpha globin chaperone, stabilizes free alpha chains, and prevents the formation of reactive oxygen radicals. Though AHSP expression has been linked to the severity of beta thalassemia, its role as a probable genetic modifier of disease severity, has still not been unequivocally established. In the present study, the level of the chaperone has been seen to vary in regularly transfused beta thalassemia patients, being underexpressed in 64% of cases, upregulated in 16% and comparable to controls in 20% of the cases. This discrepancy may be attributed to the degree of DNA damage, % HbF, and the number of nucleated RBCs in the peripheral blood of these patients. Results reveal that a decrease in the free alpha chain pool, and hence the repertoire of unbound iron, due to elevated HbF and/or the presence of nucleated RBCs in the peripheral blood results in the upregulation of the AHSP gene.

Abstract: We report the molecular and hematological characteristics associated with a large cohort of β+-thalassemia in Thailand. Study was done on 21,068 unrelated subjects referred to our center in northeast Thailand for hemoglobinopathies investigation. Among 21,068 subjects, 2637 (12.5%) were found to carry β-thalassemia. Of these 2637 cases, 705 (26.7%) carried β+-thalassemia with eight different mutations including 6 promoter mutations; NT-28 (A–G), NT-31 (A–G), NT-50 (G–A), NT-86 (C–G), NT-87 (C–A) and NT-90 (C–T) and two missense mutations; Hb Malay (codon 19; AAC-AGC) and Hb Dhonburi (codon 126; GTG-GGG). Hematological features of carriers with these β+-thalassemia (n=528) were compared with those with β0-thalassemia (n=309). Data for Hb E-β+-thalassemia (n=177) were also presented along with Hb E-β0-thalassemia in our series (n=94). All patients with Hb E-β+-thalassemia were associated with mild thalassemia intermedia phenotypes. Most of the β+-thalassemia carriers had elevated Hb A2 and mild hypochromic microcytosis, some demonstrated borderline MCV and MCH values which, could compromise carrier screening. Analysis of α/β-globin mRNA ratio in representative cases with normal, Hb E trait, β+-thalassemia trait, Hb Dhonburi trait and β0-thalassemia trait demonstrated the average values of 1.1, 1.7, 2.1, 1.7 and 3.1, respectively which is helpful in identification and differentiation of the cases.

Abstract: Among harmful conditions damaging the blood–brain barrier, cerebral stroke and reperfusion injuries were proposed as contributing factors to Alzheimer's disease etiology. Indeed it was reported that ischemic conditions promote β-amyloid peptide production in brain endothelial cells, although implicated mechanisms are yet not fully understood. Oxidative injury related to ischemia affects membrane-lipids profile by altering their biochemical properties and structural dynamics, which are also believed to play significant role in the amyloid precursor protein processing, suggesting a link between alterations in lipid membrane composition and β-amyloid peptide production enhancement. Using brain microvascular endothelial cells, here we demonstrate how oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by normal conditions restoration, mimicking ischemic environment, increases cell cholesterol amount (+20%), reduces membrane fluidity and results in strong activation (+40%) of β-secretase 1 enzymatic activity. Moreover, we observed an increase of amyloid precursor protein and β-secretase 1 protein levels with altered localization in non-discrete (Triton X-100 soluble) membrane domains, leading to an enhanced production of amyloid precursor protein β-carboxyl-terminal fragment. Therefore, lipid alterations induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation enhance β-secretase 1 activity, favor its proximity to amyloid precursor protein and may concur to increased amyloidogenic cleavage. The latter, represents a detrimental event that may contribute to β-amyloid homeostasis impairment in the brain and to Alzheimer's disease-related BBB dysfunctions.

Abstract: Iron overload coupled with low hepcidin levels are characteristics of hereditary haemochromatosis. To understand the role of transferrin receptor (TFR) and intracellular iron in hepcidin secretion, Chinese hamster ovary transferrin receptor variant (CHO TRVb-1) cells were used that express iron-response-element-depleted human TFRC mRNA (TFRC∆IRE). Results showed that CHO TRVb-1 cells expressed higher basal levels of cell-surface TFR1 than HepG2 cells (2.2-fold; p<0.01) and following 5g/L holotransferrin treatment maintained constitutive over-expression at 24h and 48h, contrasting the HepG2 cells where the receptor levels significantly declined. Despite this, the intracellular iron content was neither higher than HepG2 cells nor increased over time under basal or holotransferrin-treated conditions. Interestingly, hepcidin secretion in CHO TRVb-1 cells exceeded basal levels at all time-points (p<0.02) and matched levels in HepG2 cells following treatment. While TFRC mRNA expression showed expected elevation (2h, p<0.03; 4h; p<0.05), slc40a1 mRNA expression was also elevated (2h, p<0.05; 4h, p<0.03), unlike the HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the CHO TRVb-1 cells prevented cellular iron-overload by elevating slc40a1 expression, thereby highlighting its significance in the absence of iron-regulated TFRC mRNA. Furthermore, hepcidin response to holotransferrin treatment was similar to HepG2 cells and resembled the human physiological response.

Abstract: The HUMARA assay, the most common method for evaluation of X-inactivation skewing in blood cells, has been reported to be usable in only about 80% of females, emphasizing the need for alternative methods for testing of HUMARA-uninformative individuals. We conducted an in silico search for potentially polymorphic tri-to-hexanucleotide repeats in the proximity of CpG islands located in 5′ regions of X-chromosome genes to design five candidate assays (numbered I, II, III, IV, and V) combining methylation-specific restriction digest with PCR amplification in a manner similar to the HUMARA assay. The results obtained by these assays in 100 healthy females were compared to X-inactivation skewing measured by the AR-MSP method which is based on methylation-specific PCR amplification of the first exon of the AR gene. On the basis of statistical evidence, three of the novel assays (II, IV, and V), which were informative in 18%, 61%, and 55% of females in the cohort, respectively, may be used as alternatives or conjointly with the HUMARA assay to improve its reliability. The three new assays were combined with the HUMARA assay into a novel X-inactivation test leading to the increase of informative females in the cohort from 67% to 96%.

Abstract: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) up-regulation induces FNDC5 expression in muscle and consequently causes browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). In addition to skeletal muscle, FNDC5 is mainly expressed in heart and brain tissues. Here, we demonstrate that FNDC5 expression increased during the process of cardiac differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) similar to PGC-1α and PPARα. To testify the correlation between PGC-1α and FNDC5 in cardiac cell differentiation of mESCs, we utilized specific PPARγ agonist and antagonist in two stages of cardiac differentiation, during and post-cardiac precursor cells (CPCs) formation. Our results indicated that a reduction in PGC-1α expression, via treatment with GW9662 during CPCs formation stage, down-regulated FNDC5 transcript levels as well as mitochondrial markers which negatively influenced on the whole process of cardiac differentiation efficiency. On the other hand, increase PGC-1α expression during CPCs formation stage via rosiglitazone treatment increase FNDC5 and mitochondrial markers transcript levels which enhanced cardiac differentiation efficiency. Importantly, such alteration in PGC-1α expression at post-CPCs formation stage did not affect overall cardiac differentiation rate as expression of FNDC5 and mitochondrial markers were not significantly changed. We concluded that PPARγ agonist and antagonist induced up and down-regulation of PGC-1α and subsequently modulated the process of CPCs formation through an alteration in FNDC5 and mitochondrial markers expression.

Abstract: The risk for pulmonary hypertension (PH) in thalassemia major (TM) patients remains controversial. We report echocardiography results from 60 TM patients: we evaluated the association between tricuspid regurgitation velocities (TRV), iron stores, and serologic markers of hemolysis and arginine dysregulation. Patients were enrolled from August 2004 until May 2009. All parameters were inversely weighted by the number of exams. TRV was comparable between sexes and it was uncorrelated with age. At the first exam, TR velocities at the upper limits of normal (2.5–2.7m/s) were observed in 8 patients. An abnormal TRV (2.9m/s) was found in 1 patient. Borderline increases in TRV were associated with a reduced global arginine bioavailability (R=−0.399 P=0.005), increased anemia (hemoglobin: R=−0.219 P=0.0461), cardiac index (R=0.223 P=0.0481), and diastolic dysfunction (E/A: R=0.289 P=0.0088; E/E′: R=0.223 P=0.0453), but not hemolysis, iron overload and systolic function evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and splenectomy. Well-transfused TM patients have a lower risk for PH than thalassemia intermedia patients. However, they do have vascular stressors that raise their lifetime PH risk to levels higher than for the general population. Consequently, we support recommendations for annual echocardiographic screening and cardiac catheterization for persistent TRV above 3m/s.

Abstract: JAK2V617F mutation can be detected in the majority of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients. The JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib is the first FDA-approved treatment for MPNs. However, its use is limited by various dose related toxicities. Here, we studied the metabolic state and glutamine metabolism of BaF3-hEPOR-JAK2V617F and BaF3-hEPOR-JAK2WT cells. We found that the JAK2V617F-mutant cells were associated with increased oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate than the JAK2WT cells and there was an increased glutamine metabolism in JAK2V617F-mutant cells compared to wild-type cells. Glutaminase (GLS), the key enzyme in glutamine metabolism, was upregulated in the JAK2V617F-mutant BaF3 cells compared to the JAK2WT BaF3 cells. In MPN patient peripheral blood CD34+ cells, GLS expression was increased in JAK2V617F-mutant progenitor cells compared to JAK2 wild-type progenitor cells from the same patients and GLS levels were increased at the time of disease progression compared to at earlier time points. Moreover, GLS inhibitor increased the growth inhibitory effect of Ruxolitinib in both JAK2V617F-mutant cell lines and peripheral blood CD34+ cells from MPN patients. Therefore, GLS inhibitor should be further explored to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of JAK2 inhibitor and allow the administration of lower doses of the drug to avoid its toxicity.

Abstract: Connexin proteins are the hemichannels that form gap junctions to regulate the intercellular communication. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is the most common gap junction protein that expresses in many cell types, including the olfactory sensory neurons. Phosphorylation is a crucial step to regulate the function of Cx43. Gap junction was found to modulate the odor response, but the specific role is still elusive. Here, we report that gap junctions play a role in odor-evoked calcium response in both heterologous cell system and primary olfactory sensory neurons. This regulation is mediated through gap junction protein Cx43. Overexpression of full length Cx43 can counteract the inhibitory effect of gap junction or connexin blockers on odor-evoked [Ca2+]i increase in hana3A cells. Carboxy-terminal of Cx43 (Cx43CT) has the similar function as the full length of Cx43. Furthermore, we found that expression level of phosphorylation of Cx43 at S368 is dynamic with the stimulation of odor in hana3A cells. Expression level of phosphorylated Cx43 at S368 was decreased when gap junction or connexin inhibitors were applied. Phosphorylation of Cx43 during odor or inhibitor stimulation may be mediated by ERK and JNK signaling pathway. Altogether our data suggest that expression of Cx43 can regulate the odor response. This study provides a clue to indicate the possible protective mechanism of gap junction in odor response.

Abstract: Background
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promotes classically activated M1 macrophages. GM-CSF upregulates protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) protein expression and activation of PAR-2 by human neutrophil elastase (HNE) regulates cytokine production.
Aim
This study investigated the mechanism of PAR-2-mediated interleukin (IL)-13 production by GM-CSF-dependent macrophages stimulated with HNE.
Methods
Adherent macrophages were obtained from primary cultures of human mononuclear cells. After stimulation with HNE to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway, IL-13 mRNA and protein levels were assessed by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively.
Results
PAR-2 protein was detected in GM-CSF-dependent macrophages by Western blotting. Unexpectedly, PD98059 (an ERK1 inhibitor) increased IL-13 production, even at higher concentrations. Interestingly, U0126 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor) reduced IL-13 production in a concentration-dependent manner. Neither SB203580 (a p38alpha/p38beta inhibitor) nor BIRB796 (a p38gamma/p38delta inhibitor) affected IL-13 production, while TMB-8 (a calcium chelator) diminished IL-13 production.
Discussion
Stimulation with HNE promoted the production of IL-13 (a Th2 cytokine) by GM-CSF-dependent M1 macrophages. PAR-2-mediated IL-13 production may be dependent on the Ca2+/ERK2 signaling pathway.

Abstract: The family of lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMP) includes the ubiquitously expressed LAMP1 and LAMP2, which account for half of the proteins in the lysosomal membrane. Another member of the LAMP family is LAMP3, which is expressed only in certain cell types and differentiation stages. LAMP3 expression is linked with poor prognosis of certain cancers, and the locus where it is encoded was identified as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated the role of LAMP3 in the two main cellular degradation pathways, the proteasome and autophagy. LAMP3 mRNA was not detected in mouse models of PD or in the brain of human patients. However, it was strongly induced upon proteasomal inhibition in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Induction of LAMP3 mRNA following proteasomal inhibition was dependent on UPR transcription factor ATF4 signaling and induced autophagic flux. Prevention of LAMP3 induction enhanced apoptotic cell death. In summary, these data demonstrate that LAMP3 regulation as part of the UPR contributes to protein degradation and cell survival during proteasomal dysfunction. This link between autophagy and the proteasome may be of special importance for the treatment of tumor cells with proteasomal inhibitors.

Abstract: Deficiency of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) leads to Gaucher disease (GD), an inherited disorder characterised by storage of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in lysosomes of tissue macrophages. Recently, we reported marked increases of deacylated GlcCer, named glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), in plasma of GD patients. To improve quantification, [5–9] 13C5-GlcSph was synthesised for use as internal standard with quantitative LC-ESI-MS/MS. The method was validated using plasma of 55 GD patients and 20 controls. Intra-assay variation was 1.8% and inter-assay variation was 4.9% for GlcSph (m/z 462.3). Plasma GlcSph levels with the old and new methods closely correlate (r=0.968, slope=1.038). Next, we analysed GlcSph in 24h urine samples of 30 GD patients prior to therapy. GlcSph was detected in the patient samples (median 1.20nM, range 0.11–8.92nM), but was below the limit of quantification in normal urine. Enzyme replacement therapy led to a decrease of urinary GlcSph of GD patients, coinciding with reductions in plasma GlcSph and markers of Gaucher cells (chitotriosidase and CCL18). In analogy to globotriaosylsphingsone in urine of Fabry disease patients, additional isoforms of GlcSph differing in structure of the sphingosine moiety were identified in GD urine samples. In conclusion, GlcSph can be sensitively detected by LC-ESI-MS/MS with an internal isotope standard. Abnormalities in urinary GlcSph are a hallmark of Gaucher disease allowing biochemical confirmation of diagnosis.

Abstract: The aim of the study was to assess the current state in terms of liver and heart iron overload as well as of liver and heart related morbidity and mortality in a large cohort of thalassemia patients. Myocardial iron loading was present in 28.9% patients, which was severe in 3.2%. Liver iron was normal in 9.3% and severe in 15%. The rate of cardiac deaths started to decrease between 2000 and 2003 and dropped significantly afterwards. The prescription of combination therapy soon after the hospital admission for decompensated heart failure was associated with a decrease in the short-term mortality. In 111 adult patients who underwent liver elastometry, 14 HCVRNA positive subjects and 2 HCVRNA negative, had stiffness values suggestive of cirrhosis. No cases of hepatocarcinoma were reported. Liver “iron free foci” occurred in a HCV negative patient and the occurrence of a malignant epithelioid hemangioendothelioma led to liver transplantation in another. The study suggests that a subset of patients continues to develop progressive hemosiderosis that may lead to cardiac disease and death. Beyond its key role in preventing myocardial iron overload, liver iron chelation is essential for hampering the onset of hepatic tumors, which may not be limited to hepatocarcinoma.

Abstract: Serum EPO concentration is related primarily to the rate of erythrocyte production and, under the stimulation of hypoxia, increases exponentially as hemoglobin (Hb) decreased. The level of EPO was determined in 141 subjects including 43 normal, 44 thalassemic patients and 54 thalassemic trait subjects. The EPO level was significantly higher in the thalassemic patients (54.8mU/ml in HbH disease [α thal1/α thal2;], 78.1mU/ml in HbH with Hb CS [α thal 1/CS]; 95.6mU/ml in β-thal/HbE splenectomized [BE(S)]; and 114.8mU/ml in β-thal/HbE non-splenectomized [BE(NS)]as compared with 12.0mU/ml in normal subjects. No significant differences were detected in thalassemic trait subjects. In addition, the levels of EPO in thalassemic patients is correlated significantly with the number of reticulocytes and the reticulocyte fractions especially the fraction of immature reticulocytes. Interestingly, the highest level of EPO/% retic ratio as indicated for EPO non-responder was detected in BE(NS) patients. However, the impaired reticulocytes maturation was found to be related significantly with the levels of TNF-α,IFN-γ,IL-10, and VEGF. Since, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10 and VEGF are reported as the cytokines with erythropoietic inhibitory mediators, the variation of these cytokines in thalassemic environments may be associated to the anemic crisis in these patients.

Abstract: Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is characterized by megakaryocyte hyperplasia, dysplasia and death with progressive reticulin/collagen fibrosis in marrow and hematopoiesis in extramedullary sites. The mechanism of fibrosis was investigated by comparing TGF-β1 signaling of marrow and spleen of patients with PMF and of non-diseased individuals. Expression of 39 (23 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated) and 38 (8 up-regulated and 30 down-regulated) TGF-β1 signaling genes was altered in the marrow and spleen of PMF patients, respectively. Abnormalities included genes of TGF-β1 signaling, cell cycling and abnormal in chronic myeloid leukemia (EVI1 and p21CIP) (both marrow and spleen) and Hedgehog (marrow only) and p53 (spleen only) signaling. Pathway analyses of these alterations predict an increased osteoblast differentiation, ineffective hematopoiesis and fibrosis driven by non-canonical TGF-β1 signaling in marrow and increased proliferation and defective DNA repair in spleen. Since activation of non-canonical TGF-β1 signaling is associated with fibrosis in autoimmune diseases, the hypothesis that fibrosis in PMF results from an autoimmune process triggered by dead megakaryocytes was tested by determining that PMF patients expressed plasma levels of mitochondrial DNA and anti-mitochondrial antibodies greater than normal controls. These data identify autoimmunity as a possible cause of marrow fibrosis in PMF.

Abstract: In the first days of life, low grade jaundice is essentially universal. The source of the elevated bilirubin level giving rise to “physiological jaundice of the newborn” is only partly known. We hypothesized that it is, at least in part, the result of active and specific hemolysis involving a physiological mechanism to lower the high fetal hematocrit, appropriate for the relatively low oxygen environment in utero, to a lower level appropriate for the state of oxygen abundance after birth. We tested this by quantifying end tidal carbon monoxide (ETCO) as a marker of the rate of heme metabolism to bilirubin. We found that ETCO values of 20 neonates and children with known hemolytic disorders were higher than 20 age-matched healthy controls (p<0.0001), indicating that this instrumentation recognizes hemolysis in neonates and children. We also found that ETCO reference intervals were indeed higher in healthy neonates during the first three days after birth (5th to 95th percentile reference range, 1.4 to 1.7ppm) than after 1month of age (all ≤1.0ppm, p<0.0001). These results suggest to us that hemolysis is physiological during the first days after birth. The cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for transient hemolysis after birth are topics of current investigation.

Abstract: Background
Patients with haematopoietic disorders requiring long-term blood transfusions are at risk of iron overload. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of long-term deferasirox monotherapy in patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia in the routine clinical practice setting.
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of patients who commenced deferasirox therapy at the Hospital Bianchi Melacrino Morelli in Reggio Calabria, Italy. Data collected included cardiac and hepatic iron load (assessed by magnetic resonance imaging); left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patients were divided into two groups for analysis: group A (baseline information collected prior to deferasirox initiation) and group B (baseline information collected after deferasirox initiation).
Results
Forty-six patients were included (group A: n=25; group B: n=21). The overall population was 63% male, with a mean age of 33years. The majority of patients (65%) had thalassaemia major. In the overall population, cardiac iron levels between the baseline and first follow-up visits improved in both groups A and B (29.2 vs. 32.5ms; p=0.04 and 28.4 vs. 31.4ms; p=0.038). Liver iron levels improved significantly from baseline to visit 1 in group A (7.2 vs. 12.1ms; p<0.004) and from baseline to visit 3 (6.9 vs. 10.7; p=0.049) in group B. Generally, there was no correlation between cardiac and liver iron levels. LVEF remained stable throughout the study period. Deferasirox was well tolerated and was not associated with significant adverse events.
Conclusion
Long-term treatment with deferasirox is effective and safe in patients with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies monitored in the clinical practice setting.

Abstract: Filovirus infection of target cells leads to the formation of virally induced cytoplasmic inclusions that contain viral nucleocapsids at different stages of maturation. While the role of the inclusions has been unclear since the identification of Marburg and Ebola viruses, it recently became clear that the inclusions are the sites of viral replication, nucleocapsid formation and maturation. Live cell imaging analyses revealed that mature nucleocapsids are transported from inclusions to the filopodia, which represent the major budding sites. Moreover, inclusions recruit cellular proteins that have been shown to support the transport of nucleocapsids. For example, the tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein (Tsg101) interacts with a late domain motif in the nucleocapsid protein NP and recruits the actin-nucleation factor IQGAP1. Complexes of nucleocapsids together with Tsg101 and IQGAP1 are then co-transported along actin filaments. We detected additional proteins (Alix, Nedd4 and the AAA-type ATPase VPS4) of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) that are recruited into inclusions. Together, the results suggest that nucleocapsids recruit the machinery that enhances viral budding at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we identified Lamp1 as a marker of the late endosomal compartment in inclusions, while ER, Golgi, TGN and early endosomal markers were absent. In addition, we observed that LC3, a marker of autophagosomal membranes, was present in inclusions. The 3D structures of inclusions show an intricate structure that seems to accommodate an intimate cooperation between cellular and viral components with the intention to support viral transport and budding.

Abstract: Decreased hemoglobinization of red cells resulting in hypochromia and microcytosis are the main features of thalassemia syndromes, and also of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). A simple and reliable method is required to distinguish the two conditions in the routine laboratories. In this study we analyzed the red cell and reticulocyte parameters from 414 samples of various types of thalassemias and IDA and discovered a variety of discriminating criteria including a discrimination index (DI) which should be useful for differential diagnosis. Slightly decreased MCV and CH are suggestive of α-thalassemia 2, Hb CS, and Hb E heterozygotes whereas the increased Rbc counts are obvious in α-thalassemia 1 and β-thalassemia. In Hb E, the number of microcytic red cells was greater than the number of hypochromic red cells resulting in an increased M/H ratio. Hb H diseases are characterized by a higher number of hypochromic red cells and decreased CHCM, while broadening of hemoglobin concentration histogram results in increased HDW in β-thalassemia diseases. Iron deficiency anemia results in hypochromic–microcytic red cells and increased RDW. The number of reticulocyte with %High Retic and CHr value were increased in the first month of iron supplementation indicating the response to iron therapy.

Abstract: Objective
To determine the contribution of the OCT-4 to the pathogenesis of leukemia.
Methods
Bone marrow (BM) samples obtained from 72 patients with leukemia, and 18 normal healthy subjects were assayed for their OCT-4 expression using both flow cytometry and RT-PCR.
Results
OCT-4 expression in BM nucleated cells of acute leukemia patients (n=33) was significantly higher than that of complete remission and chronic phase leukemia patients (n=39, p<0.001) and healthy donors (n=18, p<0.001). OCT-4 expression had a significant positive relation with CD34 expression (n=43, r=0.721, p<0.001) and the proportion of naive cells (n=60, r=0.687, p<0.001). In addition, the results of QRT-PCR detection showed that the OCT-4A had increased expression in BM nucleated cells in the patients with acute leukemia (n=33, median 16.585, range 0.38–169.62) compared to that in leukemia patients with chronic phase and in complete remission (n=39, median 3.34, range 0.04–44.49, p<0.001) and that of normal controls (n=18, median 2.89, range 0.18–16.23, p<0.001).
Conclusion
OCT-4A expression was significantly increased in the BM nucleated cells of patients with acute leukemia, indicating that OCT-4A may play an important role in the pathogenesis of leukemia and may serve as a molecular target for the development of novel diagnostic and treatment strategies in leukemia.

Abstract: Among the several cytokines involved in the psoriasis pathogenesis, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-17 play a central role. Many biomolecular steps remain unknown due to difficulty to obtain psoriatic models. To investigate the effect of TNF-alpha and IL-17 on the ultrastructure, immunophenotype, and number of epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs), human skin explants (n=7) were cultured air–liquid interface in a Transwell system. Four different conditions were used: medium alone (control), medium added with 100ng/ml TNF-alpha or 50ng/ml IL-17 or a combination of both cytokines. Samples were harvested 24 and 48h after cytokine addition and were frozen. Samples harvested at 24h were also processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). By immunofluorescence analysis with anti-human Langerin antibody (three experiments/sample) we calculated the percentage of LCs/mm2 of living epidermis after 24 and 48h of incubation (considering control as 100%). At 24h LC number was significantly higher in samples treated with both cytokines (216.71+15.10%; p<0.001) and in TNF-alpha (125.74+26.24%; p<0.05). No differences were observed in IL-17-treated samples (100.14+38.42%). After 48h, the number of epidermal Langerin-positive cells in IL-17- and TNF-alpha treated samples slightly decreased (94.99+36.79% and 101.37+23% vs. their controls, respectively). With the combination of both cytokines epidermal LCs strongly decreased (120+13.36%). By TEM, upon TNF-alpha stimulus LCs appeared with few organelles, mostly mitochondria, lysosomes, and scattered peripherical BGs. Upon IL-17 stimulus, LCs showed a cytoplasm with many mitochondria and numerous BGs close to the perinuclear space and Golgi apparatus, but also at the periphery, at the beginning of the dendrites. The addition of both cytokines did not affect LC ultrastructure. Our study showed that IL-17 induced significant changes in LC ultrastructure, while the combination of both cytokines seems to have a strong chemo-attractant effect on epidermal LCs, supporting the relevance of investigating the interplay between LCs and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the ongoing of the disease.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α induces matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that may disrupt skin integrity. We have investigated the effects and mechanisms of exogenous TNF-α on collagen degradation by incubating human skin explants in defined serum-free media with or without TNF-α (10ng/ml) in the absence or presence of the nonselective MMP inhibitor GM6001 for 8 days. The basal culture conditions promoted type I collagen catabolism that was accelerated by TNF-α (p<0.005) and accomplished by MMPs (p<0.005). Levels of the collagenases MMP-8 and MMP-13 were insignificant and neither MMP-2 nor MMP-14 were associated with increased collagen degradation. TNF-α increased secretion of MMP-1 (p<0.01) but had no impact on MMP-1 quantities in the tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed similar tissue MMP-1 expression with or without TNF-α with epidermis being the major source of MMP-1. Increased tissue-derived collagenolytic activity with TNF-α exposure was blocked by neutralizing MMP-1 monoclonal antibody and was not due to down-regulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. TNF-α increased production (p<0.01), tissue levels (p<0.005) and catalytic activity of the endogenous MMP-1 activator MMP-3. Type I collagen degradation correlated with MMP-3 tissue levels (rs=0.68, p<0.05) and was attenuated with selective MMP-3 inhibitor. Type I collagen formation was down-regulated in cultured compared with native skin explants but was not reduced further by TNF-α. TNF-α had no significant effect on epidermal apoptosis. Our data indicate that TNF-α augments collagenolytic activity of MMP-1, possibly through up-regulation of MMP-3 leading to gradual loss of type I collagen in human skin.
