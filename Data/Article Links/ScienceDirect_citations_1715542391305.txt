Abstract: Summary
Development of spermatogonia and spermatocytes are the critical steps of spermatogenesis, impacting on male fertility. Investigation of the related regulators benefits the understanding of male reproduction. The proteasome system has been reported to regulate spermatogenesis, but the mechanisms and key contributing factors in vivo are poorly explored. Here we found that ablation of REGγ, a proteasome activator, resulted in male subfertility. Analysis of the mouse testes after birth showed there was a decreased number of PLZF+ spermatogonia and spermatocytes. Molecular analysis found that REGγ loss significantly increased the abundance of p53 protein in the testis, and directly repressed PLZF transcription in cell lines. Of note, allelic p53 haplodeficiency partially rescued the defects in spermatogenesis observed in REGγ-deficient mice. In summary, our results identify REGγ-p53-PLZF to be a critical pathway that regulates spermatogenesis and establishes a new molecular link between the proteasome system and male reproduction.

Abstract: Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein associated with cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions, playing an important role in linkage of integrin adhesion molecules to the actin cytoskeleton. The planarian nervous system is a fascinating system for studying the organogenesis during regeneration. In this paper, a homolog gene of Vinculin, DjVinculin, was identified and characterized in Dugesia japonica. The DjVinculin sequence analysis revealed that it contains an opening reading frame encoding a putative protein of 975 amino acids with functionally domains that are highly conserved, including eight anti-parallel α-helical bundles organized into five distinct domains. Whole mount in situ hybridization showed that DjVinculin was predominantly expressed in the brain of intact and regenerating planarians. RNA interference of DjVinculin caused distinct defects in brain morphogenesis and influences the regeneration of planarian GABAergic neurons. The expression level of DjGAD protein was decreased in the DjVinculin-knockdown planarians. These findings suggest that DjVinculin is required for GABAergic neurons regeneration.

Abstract: CUB domains are most exclusively found in secreted proteins and in a few transmembrane proteins. These domains are approximately 110 amino acids long and have four conserved cysteines that form a β-sandwich fold. CUB domains proteins are involved in a wide range of biological functions. We have shown that CUB domains from Tolloid/BMP1 can bind BMP4 and block BMP signaling in the developing frog embryo. CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) is one of the few transmembrane glycoprotein that contains three extracellular CUB domains and regulates anchorage-independent growth and cancer cell migration through activation of Src kinases. In the extracellular space, only a few proteins were found to interact with CDCP1 and at the moment no ligand was found. We demonstrate by using real time protein interaction on BIAcore chip that CDCP1 CUB domains bind directly to TGF-β1 and BMP4. CDCP1 enhances TGF-β1 signaling reporter activity and phosphorylated Smad2 levels but does not modulate BMP signaling pathway. CDCP1 actions on TGF-β/Smad2 signaling are dependent on Smad2 and TGFRI and do not require Src or PKCδ binding. Our findings uncover a new co-receptor for TGF-β1 and bring up new questions on whether CDCP1 cooperates with TGF-β1 to promote cancer progression.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are being exploited for patient-derived stem-cell therapies. As the biological properties of MSCs derived from skeletal muscle of osteoarthritis patients are poorly understood, the aim of this study was to compare muscle MSCs with well-recognized bone and bone marrow-derived MSCs from these patients. Paired samples of skeletal muscle and trabecular bone tissue were obtained from 21 patients with osteoarthritis. Isolated cells were compared using ex vivo immunophenotyping and detailed in vitro analyses. These included the colony forming unit fibroblast assay, growth kinetics, senescence, multilineage potential, immunophenotyping, and MSC marker gene expression profiling. Freshly isolated MSCs from muscle showed improved viability over bone-derived MSCs, with similar mesenchymal fraction. Muscle-derived MSCs showed superior clonogenicity, higher growth rates, and lower doubling times. Muscle-derived MSCs also showed superior osteogenic and myogenic properties and a positive correlation between CD271 expression and adipogenesis. Senescence rate as well as adipogenic and chondrogenic potentials were similar. Skeletal muscle-derived MSCs of osteoarthritis patients have superior clonogenicity and growth kinetics compared to bone-derived MSCs, making them a good candidate for autologous stem-cell therapies. Moreover, the positive correlation between CD271 and adipogenesis suggest that CD271 expressing muscle MSCs might contribute to muscle steatosis observed in osteoarthritis.

Abstract: Eph receptor and ephrin signaling has a major role in segregating distinct cell populations to form sharp borders. Expression of interacting Ephs and ephrins typically occurs in complementary regions, such that polarised activation of both components occurs at the interface. Forward signaling through Eph receptors can drive cell segregation, but it is unclear whether reverse signaling through ephrins can also contribute. We have tested the role of reverse signaling, and of polarised versus non-polarised activation, in assays in which contact repulsion drives cell segregation and border sharpening. We find that polarised forward signaling drives stronger segregation than polarised reverse signaling. Nevertheless, reverse signaling contributes since bidirectional Eph and ephrin activation drives stronger segregation than unidirectional forward signaling alone. In contrast, non-polarised Eph activation drives little segregation. We propose that although polarised forward signaling is the principal driver of segregation, reverse signaling enables bidirectional repulsion which prevents mingling of each population into the other.

Abstract: Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) promotes atherosclerosis in association with the functions of endothelial cells. Clock and Bmal1, as two main components of molecular circadian clock, play important regulatory roles during progression of atherogenesis. However, whether Clock and Bmal1 are involved in the regulation of endothelial proliferation disturbed by TMAO are unclear. We observed that cell proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was inhibited after exposed to TMAO for 24 h. Besides, TMAO caused increased expression of lncRNA-NEAT1, Clock and Bmal1, and inhibited MAPK pathways. While MAPK pathways were blocked, the expression of Clock and Bmal1 was elevated. NEAT1 showed a circadian rhythmic expression in HUVECs, and its overexpression reduced cell proliferation. Knockdown or overexpression of NEAT1 might decrease or increase the expression of Clock and Bmal1 respectively, while raised or suppressed the expression of MAPK pathways correspondingly. Asparagus extract (AE) was found to improve the TMAO-reduced HUVECs proliferation. Moreover, it ameliorated the disorders of NEAT1, Clock, Bmal1, and MAPK signaling pathways induced by TMAO. Therefore, our findings indicated that NEAT1 regulating Clock-Bmal1 via MAPK pathways was involved in TMAO-repressed HUVECs proliferation, and AE improved endothelial proliferation by TMAO, proposing a novel mechanism for cardiovascular disease prevention.

Abstract: Lymphoma is among the top 10 leading causes of cancer-related morbidity around the world in males, but currently, there is a lack of effective treatment strategies for this disease. Recently, we identified an alternatively spliced protein isoform, CMTM1-v5, which is significantly associated with tumor development and could serve as a potential therapeutic drug for lymphoma. Here, we showed that the overexpression of CMTM1-v5 in Raji cells or the addition of the CMTM1-v5 polypeptide to the cell culture medium induced apoptosis in vitro. During the in vivo experiments, most of the fluorescent CMTM1-v5 polypeptide converged within the tumor cells in Raji xenografts 24 h after treatment, and the injection of the polypeptide into the tail vein significantly extended survival in mice bearing Raji tumor cells. Mechanistically, the interaction between CMTM1-v5 and CAML (calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand) negatively regulated the Ca2+ response in the ER, inducing the activation of caspases and the release of cytochrome c in mitochondria and resulting in cell apoptosis. Thus, our study provides a proof-to-concept that supports the use of CMTM1-v5 to treat lymphoma.

Abstract: Friedreich's ataxia is caused by large homozygous, intronic expansions of GAA repeats in the frataxin (FXN) gene, resulting in severe downregulation of its expression. Pathogenic repeats are located in intron one, hence patients express unaffected FXN protein, albeit in low quantities. Although FRDA symptoms typically afflict the nervous system, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the predominant cause of death. Our studies were conducted using cardiomyocytes differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from control individuals, FRDA patients, and isogenic cells corrected by zinc finger nucleases-mediated excision of pathogenic expanded GAA repeats. This correction of the FXN gene removed the primary trigger of the transcription defect, upregulated frataxin expression, reduced pathological lipid accumulation observed in patient cardiomyocytes, and reversed gene expression signatures of FRDA cardiomyocytes. Transcriptome analyses revealed hypertrophy-specific expression signatures unique to FRDA cardiomyocytes, and emphasized similarities between unaffected and ZFN-corrected FRDA cardiomyocytes. Thus, the iPSC-derived FRDA cardiomyocytes exhibit various molecular defects characteristic for cellular models of cardiomyopathy that can be corrected by genome editing of the expanded GAA repeats. These results underscore the utility of genome editing in generating isogenic cellular models of FRDA and the potential of this approach as a future therapy for this disease.

Abstract: Angiogenesis plays important roles in solid tumors progression. Growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) can induce angiogenesis and hypoxia promotes the expression of VEGFs through activating hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α). However, the regulation of HIF-1α still not been fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that the Sine Oculis Homeobox Homolog 4 (SIX4) is up-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and high expression of SIX4 predicts a poor prognosis. Overexpression of SIX4 enhances tumor growth and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, while knockdown of SIX4 inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, we show that SIX4 increases the expression of VEGF-A by coordinating with the HIF-1α. Mechanically, we explore that SIX4 up-regulates the expression of HIF-1α depending on Akt activation. Collectively, we demonstrate that SIX4 is functional in regulating tumor angiogenesis and SIX4 might be used as anti-angiogenic therapy in CRC.

Abstract: Apart from pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricle (RV) hypertrophy, metabolic dysfunction also plays a major role in pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Recently, we have shown that fatty acid synthase (FAS), an enzyme involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis, plays a pivotal role in PH as its inhibition was protective and decreased pulmonary vascular remodelling, RV pressure and hypertrophy and improved endothelial functions. However, the precise mechanism behind protective effect of FAS inhibition on right ventricle dysfunction associated with PH is not completely understood. Therefore, the present study delineated the mechanism of protective effect of FAS inhibition on RV dysfunction associated with PH. siRNA mediated inhibition of FAS reduced FAS expression, hypertrophy, inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy and improved the glucose oxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP level in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. In monocrotaline (MCT) treated rats, FAS inhibition by C75 (2 mg/kg, i.p., once a week from 21 to 35 days) decreased the expression and activity of FAS and palmitate level. C75 also improved cardiac functions and mitochondrial membrane potential leading to decreased apoptosis in RV of MCT treated rats. In conclusion, our study reveals that inhibition of FAS decreases RV hypertrophy and improves cardiac function associated with PH by perking up metabolic functions.

Abstract: SIRT5 has a wide range of functions in different cellular processes such as glycolysis, TCA cycle and antioxidant defense, which mediates lysine desuccinylation, deglutarylation and demalonylation. Recent evidences have implicated that SIRT5 is a potential suppressor of gastric cancer (GC). However, the underlying mechanism of SIRT5 in gastric cancer is still unclear. Here, we show that SIRT5 expression is significantly decreased in human GC tissues. Functional analysis demonstrates that SIRT5 inhibits cell growth in vitro and in vivo, arrests the cell cycle in G1/S transition, and suppresses migration and invasion of GC cells via regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that there is the direct interaction between SIRT5 and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), and desuccinylation of OGDH by SIRT5 inhibits the activity of OGDH complex. Further studies of the relationship between SIRT5 and OGDH show OGDH inhibition by succinyl phosphonate (SP) or siRNA suppresses the increase in cell growth and migration induced by SIRT5 deletion. Moreover, SIRT5 decreases mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), ATP products and increases the ROS levels and NADP/NADPH ratio in GC cells through the inhibition of OGDH complex activity. Therefore, SIRT5 suppresses GC cell growth and migration through desuccinylating OGDH and inhibiting OGDH complex activity to disturb mitochondrial functions and redox status.

Abstract: Fibrosis is a common pathology in renal disease. Hypertensive nephropathy (HN) is one of the most common secondary nephropathies that often progresses to severe renal fibrosis with limited treatment options beyond hypertension control. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) was recently recognized as a target in signaling pathways that underlie the pathologies of inflammatory diseases and tumors. A recently developed inhibitor of Brd4, JQ1, has been shown to exert antifibrotic effects and is being clinically explored as an anti-inflammatory and antitumor drug. Here, using human kidney biopsies and Angiotensin II-induced mouse fibrotic kidney samples, we show that Brd4 was upregulated in renal tissue from HN patients and hypertensive mouse models. In mice, JQ1 alleviated Angiotensin II-induced kidney fibrosis and blocked epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by altering the expression of EMT-related proteins. Using an in vitro model of HK2 cells exposed to Angiotensin II, we also demonstrated that JQ1 suppressed the protein expression of fibrotic genes in these cells. These results further implicate Brd4 in the fibrotic response in HN and reveal that Brd4 is a potential antifibrotic target. BET inhibitors are currently being investigated in clinical trials as antitumor agents and show potent pharmacological effects. Our findings suggest that BET inhibitors may also be potential translational therapies for HN.

Abstract: Summary
In vertebrates, GATA2 is a master regulator of hematopoiesis and is expressed throughout embryo development and in adult life. Although the essential role of GATA2 in mouse hematopoiesis is well established, its involvement during early human hematopoietic development is not clear. By combining time-controlled overexpression of GATA2 with genetic knockout experiments, we found that GATA2, at the mesoderm specification stage, promotes the generation of hemogenic endothelial progenitors and their further differentiation to hematopoietic progenitor cells, and negatively regulates cardiac differentiation. Surprisingly, genome-wide transcriptional and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that GATA2 bound to regulatory regions, and repressed the expression of cardiac development-related genes. Moreover, genes important for hematopoietic differentiation were upregulated by GATA2 in a mostly indirect manner. Collectively, our data reveal a hitherto unrecognized role of GATA2 as a repressor of cardiac fates, and highlight the importance of coordinating the specification and repression of alternative cell fates.

Abstract: Desminopathies are a type of myofibrillar myopathy resulting from mutations in DES, encoding the intermediate filament protein desmin. They display heterogeneous phenotypes, suggesting environment influences. Patient muscle proteins show oxidative features linking oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and abnormal protein deposition. To improve understanding of redox balance in desminopathies, we further developed cellular models of four pathological mutants localized in 2B helical domain (the most important region for desmin polymerization) to explore desmin behavior upon oxidative stress. We show that the mutations desQ389P and desD399Y share common stress-induced aggregates, desR406W presents more scattered cytoplasmic aggregative pattern, and pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant molecule, prevents all type of aggregation. Mutants desD399Y and desR406W had delayed oxidation kinetics following H2O2 stress prevented by NAC pretreatment. Further, we used AAV-injected mouse models to confirm in vivo effects of N-acetyl-l-cysteine. AAV-desD399Y-injected muscles displayed similar physio-pathological characteristics as observed in patients. However, after 2 months of NAC treatment, they did not have reduced aggregates. Finally, in both models, stress induced some post-translational modifications changing Isoelectric Point, such as potential hyperphosphorylations, and/or molecular weight of human desmin by proteolysis. However, each mutant presented its own pattern that seemed to be post-aggregative. In conclusion, our results indicate that individual desmin mutations have unique pathological molecular mechanisms partly linked to alteration of redox homeostasis. Integrating these mutant-specific behaviors will be important when considering future therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
The site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins via amber suppression provides access to novel protein properties, structures, and functions. Historically, poor protein expression yields resulting from release factor 1 (RF1) competition has limited this technology. To address this limitation, we develop a high-yield, one-pot cell-free platform for synthesizing proteins bearing ncAAs based on genomically recoded Escherichia coli lacking RF1. A key feature of this platform is the independence on the addition of purified T7 DNA-directed RNA polymerase (T7RNAP) to catalyze transcription. Extracts derived from our final strain demonstrate high productivity, synthesizing 2.67 ± 0.06 g/L superfolder GFP in batch mode without supplementation of purified T7RNAP. Using an optimized one-pot platform, we demonstrate multi-site incorporation of the ncAA p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine into an elastin-like polypeptide with high accuracy of incorporation and yield. Our work has implications for chemical and synthetic biology.

Abstract: Summary
In contrast to conventional human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that are related to post-implantation embryo stages, naive hPSCs exhibit features of pre-implantation epiblast. Naive hPSCs are established by resetting conventional hPSCs, or are derived from dissociated embryo inner cell masses. Here we investigate conditions for transgene-free reprogramming of human somatic cells to naive pluripotency. We find that Wnt inhibition promotes RNA-mediated induction of naive pluripotency. We demonstrate application to independent human fibroblast cultures and endothelial progenitor cells. We show that induced naive hPSCs can be clonally expanded with a diploid karyotype and undergo somatic lineage differentiation following formative transition. Induced naive hPSC lines exhibit distinctive surface marker, transcriptome, and methylome properties of naive epiblast identity. This system for efficient, facile, and reliable induction of transgene-free naive hPSCs offers a robust platform, both for delineation of human reprogramming trajectories and for evaluating the attributes of isogenic naive versus conventional hPSCs.

Abstract: Müller cells are the predominant retinal glial cells. One of the key roles of Müller cells is in the uptake of the neurotransmitter glutamate and in its conversion to glutamine. Müller cell dysfunction due to oxidative stress elicited by high glutamate concentrations can lead to toxicity, which promote the pathogenesis of retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. This study investigated the anti-oxidant activity and mechanisms of betulinic acid (BA) and its derivatives in human Müller cells. Human MIO-M1 Müller cells were pre-treated in the presence or absence of BA, BE as well as their derivatives (named H3–H20) followed by incubation with glutamate. Cell viability was evaluated with the MTT and calcein-AM assays. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in MIO-M1 cells was measured using CM-H2DCFDA and flow cytometry. The activation of cellular apoptosis and necrosis was analyzed with annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometry. The modulation of signaling pathways involved in glutamate-mediated cytotoxicity and ROS production was evaluated by immunoblotting. The BA derivatives H3, H5 and H7 exhibited minimal cytotoxicity and significant anti-oxidant activity. These compounds significantly suppressed ROS production and attenuated cellular necrosis elicited by glutamate-induced oxidative stress. The protective effects of H3, H5 and H7 in MIO-M1 cells were associated with the attenuation of Akt, Erk, and JNK signaling. The BA analogues H3, H5 and H7 are protective against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in human Müller cells, and elicit their actions by modulation of the Erk, Akt and JNK signaling pathways. These agents are potential candidate molecules for the prevention or treatment of human retinal diseases.

Abstract: Summary
X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS), linked to mutations in the RS1 gene, is a degenerative retinopathy with a retinal splitting phenotype. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from patients to study XLRS in a 3D retinal organoid in vitro differentiation system. This model recapitulates key features of XLRS including retinal splitting, defective retinoschisin production, outer-segment defects, abnormal paxillin turnover, and impaired ER-Golgi transportation. RS1 mutation also affects the development of photoreceptor sensory cilia and results in altered expression of other retinopathy-associated genes. CRISPR/Cas9 correction of the disease-associated C625T mutation normalizes the splitting phenotype, outer-segment defects, paxillin dynamics, ciliary marker expression, and transcriptome profiles. Likewise, mutating RS1 in control hiPSCs produces the disease-associated phenotypes. Finally, we show that the C625T mutation can be repaired precisely and efficiently using a base-editing approach. Taken together, our data establish 3D organoids as a valid disease model.

Abstract: A typical nucleolus structure is shaped by three components. A meshwork of fine fibers forming the fibrillar center (FC) is surrounded by densely packed fibers forming the dense fibrillar component (DFC). Meanwhile, wrapping the FC and DFC is the granular component (GC). During the mitotic prophase, the nucleolus undergoes disassembling of its components. On the contrary, throughout the first meiotic prophase that occurs in the cells of the germ line, small nucleoli are assembled into one nucleolus by the end of the prophase. These nucleoli are transcriptionally active, suggesting that they are fully functional. Electron microscopy analysis has suggested that these nucleoli display their three main components but a typical organization has not been observed. Here, by immunolabeling and electron microscopy, we show that the nucleolus has its three main components. The GC is interlaced with the DFC and is not as well defined as previously thought during leptotene and zygotene stage.

Abstract: Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are main adjuvant therapies for the treatment of gastric cancer, the treatment effects are individual difference, but the specific mechanism is unknown. CyTOF 2 mass cytometer (CyTOF) enables the detecting up to 135 parameters on single cell, the emergence of which is an opportunity for proteomics research. We first tried to apply CyTOF technique to gastric cancer cells. We verified applicability of CyTOF in gastric cancer cells, and analyzed the responses of seventeen proteins to chemoradiotherapy in human gastric cancer AGS cells. To analyze the high dimensional CyTOF data, we used two statistical and visualization tools including viSNE and Citrus. Two specific clusters were found which had differences in protein expression profiles. CyTOF technology is proved feasibility and value at single cell level of gastric cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Diet is a key determinant of human gut microbiome variation. However, the fine-scale relationships between daily food choices and human gut microbiome composition remain unexplored. Here, we used multivariate methods to integrate 24-h food records and fecal shotgun metagenomes from 34 healthy human subjects collected daily over 17 days. Microbiome composition depended on multiple days of dietary history and was more strongly associated with food choices than with conventional nutrient profiles, and daily microbial responses to diet were highly personalized. Data from two subjects consuming only meal replacement beverages suggest that a monotonous diet does not induce microbiome stability in humans, and instead, overall dietary diversity associates with microbiome stability. Our work provides key methodological insights for future diet-microbiome studies and suggests that food-based interventions seeking to modulate the gut microbiota may need to be tailored to the individual microbiome.

Abstract: Summary
The human gut contains a vast array of viruses, mostly bacteriophages. The majority remain uncharacterized, and their roles in shaping the gut microbiome and in impacting on human health remain poorly understood. We performed longitudinal metagenomic analysis of fecal viruses in healthy adults that reveal high temporal stability, individual specificity, and correlation with the bacterial microbiome. Using a database-independent approach that uses most of the sequencing data, we uncovered the existence of a stable, numerically predominant individual-specific persistent personal virome. Clustering of viral genomes and de novo taxonomic annotation identified several groups of crAss-like and Microviridae bacteriophages as the most stable colonizers of the human gut. CRISPR-based host prediction highlighted connections between these stable viral communities and highly predominant gut bacterial taxa such as Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium. This study provides insights into the structure of the human gut virome and serves as an important baseline for hypothesis-driven research.

Abstract: Summary
Cell lineage reprogramming via transgene overexpression of key master regulatory transcription factors has been well documented. However, the poor efficiency and lack of fidelity of this approach is problematic. Synthetic transcription factors (sTFs)—built from the repurposed CRISPR/Cas9 system—can activate endogenous target genes to direct differentiation or trigger lineage reprogramming. Here we explored whether sTFs could be used to steer mouse neural stem cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts toward the oligodendrocyte lineage. We developed a non-viral modular expression system to enable stable multiplex delivery of pools of sTFs capable of transcriptional activation of three key oligodendrocyte lineage master regulatory genes (Sox10, Olig2, and Nkx6-2). Delivery of these sTFs could enhance neural stem cell differentiation and initiated mouse embryonic fibroblast direct reprograming toward oligodendrocyte progenitor-like cells. Our findings demonstrate the value of sTFs as tools for activating endogenous genes and directing mammalian cell-type identity.

Abstract: Summary
The target profiles of many drugs are established early in their development and are not systematically revisited at the time of FDA approval. Thus, it is often unclear whether therapeutics with the same nominal targets but different chemical structures are functionally equivalent. In this paper we use five different phenotypic and biochemical assays to compare approved inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6—collectively regarded as breakthroughs in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. We find that transcriptional, proteomic, and phenotypic changes induced by palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib differ significantly; abemaciclib in particular has advantageous activities partially overlapping those of alvocidib, an older polyselective CDK inhibitor. In cells and mice, abemaciclib inhibits kinases other than CDK4/6 including CDK2/cyclin A/E—implicated in resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition—and CDK1/cyclin B. The multifaceted experimental and computational approaches described here therefore uncover underappreciated differences in CDK4/6 inhibitor activities with potential importance in treating human patients.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we have used patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and gene-editing technology to study the cardiac-related molecular and functional consequences of mutations in GLA causing the lysosomal storage disorder Fabry disease (FD), for which heart dysfunction is a major cause of mortality. Our in vitro model recapitulated clinical data with FD cardiomyocytes accumulating GL-3 and displaying an increased excitability, with altered electrophysiology and calcium handling. Quantitative proteomics enabled the identification of >5,500 proteins in the cardiomyocyte proteome and secretome, and revealed accumulation of the lysosomal protein LIMP-2 and secretion of cathepsin F and HSPA2/HSP70-2 in FD. Genetic correction reversed these changes. Overexpression of LIMP-2 directly induced the secretion of cathepsin F and HSPA2/HSP70-2, implying causative relationship, and led to massive vacuole accumulation. In summary, our study has revealed potential new cardiac biomarkers for FD, and provides valuable mechanistic insight into the earliest pathological events in FD cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Although stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to facilitate regeneration of injured tissue, there is no report that evaluates the immune-modulating effect of stem cell-derived EVs on Th2-mediated inflammation. In this study, we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of adipose stem cells (ASCs)-derived EVs on Th2-mediated inflammation induced by Aspergillus protease antigen in lung epithelial cells. The EVs were isolated from supernatant of ASCs and the diameters of EVs were measured by using dynamic light scattering. The mice primary lung epithelial cells and mouse lung epithelial cell line (MLE12) were pre-treated with 200 ng/ml of Aspergillus protease and then treated with 1 μg/ml of ASC-derived EVs. Real time PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of eotaxin, IL-25, TGF-β, and IL-10 mRNAs after EV treatment. To evaluate the role of EVs in macrophage polarization and dendritic cells (DCs) differentiation, in vitro bone marrow-derived macrophage and DCs stimulation assay was performed. EV treatment significantly decreased the expression of eotaxin and IL-25 and increased TGF-β and IL-10 in both lung epithelial cells. EV treatment significantly increased the expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40, CD80, and CD 86 in immature DCs. Furthermore, EV treatment significantly enhanced the gene expression of M2 macrophage marker such as Arg1, CCL22, IL-10, and TGF-β. In conclusion, EVs of ASCs ameliorated Th2-mediated inflammation induced by Aspergillus protease antigen through the activation of dendritic cells and M2 macrophage, accompanied by down-regulation of eotaxin and IL-25, and up-regulation of TGF-β and IL-10 in mouse lung epithelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
The use of adult skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) for cell therapy has been attempted for decades, but still encounters considerable difficulties. MuSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are promising candidates for stem cell therapy to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Here we report that four transcription factors, HEYL, KLF4, MYOD, and PAX3, selected by comprehensive screening of different MuSC populations, enhance the derivation of PAX3-positive myogenic progenitors from fibroblasts and hiPSCs, using medium that promotes the formation of presomitic mesoderm. These induced PAX3-positive cells contribute efficiently to the repair of DMD-damaged myofibers and also reconstitute the MuSC population. These studies demonstrate how a combination of core transcription factors can fine-tune the derivation of MuSCs capable of contributing to the repair of adult skeletal muscle.

Abstract: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subset of cancer cells, which possess self-renewal ability, and lead to tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Live detection and isolation of CSCs are important to understand the biology of CSCs as well as to screen drugs that target them. Even though CSCs are detected using surface markers, there is a lot of inconsistencies for that in a given cancer type. At the same time, self-renewal markers like ALDH1A1, OCT4A and SOX2, which are intracellular molecules, are reliable markers for CSCs in different cancers. In the present study, we generated a reporter construct for self-renewing CSCs, based on ALDH1A1 expression. Oral cancer cells harboring ALDH1A1-DsRed2 were used to screen inhibitors that target CSCs. Our results showed that Comb1, a cocktail of inhibitors for EGF and TGF-β pathways and their intermediates, effectively reduced the DsRed2 population to 34%. Our immunohistochemical analysis on primary oral cancer corroborated the importance of EGF and TGF-β pathways in sustaining CSCs. Since these two pathways are also critical for the self-renewal and differentiation of normal stem cells, Comb1 might abolish them as well. On analysis of the effect of Comb1 on normal murine bone marrow cells, there was no significant change in the stem cell self-renewal and differentiation potential in the treated group compared to untreated cells. To conclude, we claim that ALDH1A1-DsRed2 is a useful tool to detect CSCs, and Comb1 is effective in targeting CSCs without affecting normal stem cells.

Abstract: The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of cancer regulators. The objective of the study was to elucidate the roles and underlying mechanisms of XIST in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) suggested that XIST was highly upregulated in laryngeal squamous cancerous (LSCC) tissues. Knockdown of XIST, mediated by lentiviral transfection of XIST-specific short-hairpin RNA (shRNA), led to the inhibition of proliferation, migration, and invasion of LSCC cells in vitro. In vivo, XIST knockdown also suppressed the growth of LSCC xenografts in mice. Upregulation of miR-124 and downregulation of EZH2 were concomitantly observed after XIST knockdown, and our data suggested that XIST served as the competitive endogenous RNA of miR-124 to modulate EZH2 expression. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of EZH2 prominently attenuated the anti-proliferation activity by XIST knockdown. Therefore, XIST plays an important role in progression of LSCC by modulating the miR-124-EZH2 axis.

Abstract: Summary
Actin waves are filamentous actin (F-actin)-rich structures that initiate in the somato-neuritic area and move toward neurite ends. The upstream cues that initiate actin waves are poorly understood. Here, using an optogenetic approach (Opto-cytTrkB), we found that local activation of the TrkB receptor around the neurite end initiates actin waves and triggers neurite elongation. During actin wave generation, locally activated TrkB signaling in the distal neurite was functionally connected with preferentially localized Rac1 and its signaling pathways in the proximal region. Moreover, TrkB activity changed the location of ankyrinG––the master organizer of the axonal initial segment-and initiated the stimulated neurite to acquire axonal characteristics. Taken together, these findings suggest that local Opto-cytTrkB activation switches the fate from minor to major axonal neurite during neuronal polarization by generating actin waves.

Abstract: Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) are a type of adult stem cell from the mesoderm with the capacity to migrate and differentiate into other cell lineages. As a morphogenetic state of stem cells, glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been found to promote cell proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. The aims of our study were to investigate the biological activity of AMSCs and whether the GDNF gene can enhance the anti-inflammatory properties of stem cells. In this study, stable proliferative GDNF-overexpressing AMSC lines were successfully established and the AMSCs/GDNF-AMSCs were cocultured with macrophages (Mφ) derived from THP-1 cells in a transwell system. The mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-4 were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In addition, the expressions of CD163 and CD206, two markers of M2 macrophages, were detected with flow cytometric analysis. In animal experiments, AMSCs/GDNF-AMSCs (5 × 105) were administered to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) nude mice for 3 or 7 days. The expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), IL-6, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and α-Smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were determined by Western blotting. Renal pathological changes of all groups were observed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson staining. In conclusion, in vitro cultured AMSCs induced a shift in macrophage phenotype from the inflammatory (M1) phenotype to the reparative (M2) phenotype. In the UUO model, AMSC treatment was conducive to the recovery of renal function and interstitial fibrosis. Therefore, we determined that AMSC therapy could promote the phenotypic transformation of macrophages and reduce the progression of renal fibrosis by suppressing inflammation. GDNF could enhance the anti-inflammatory effect of AMSCs.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells home towards inflammatory microenvironments, such as the tumour stroma, where they have been shown to have both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects. Here, we demonstrate that the aspartic acid protease cathepsin D is part of the chemoattraction process. Using a Boyden chamber co-culture system, the migration of the mesenchymal stem cells and their invasion through Matrigel increased in the presence of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, colon cancer HT29 cells or their conditioned media. Mesenchymal stem cell movement was reduced by protease inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases and by pepstatin A, an inhibitor of cathepsin D. We confirmed a role for cathepsin D through addition of recombinant protein, upregulation of cathepsin D release using chloroquine and knockdown of cathepsin D expression. While all cell types expressed active cathepsin D, enzymatically inactive precursor procathepsin D was expressed only at low levels by mesenchymal stem cells. Expression in mesenchymal stem cells was increased following co-culture with cancer cells. The chemoattractive effect of cathepsin D required its enzymatic activity, but not changes in mesenchymal stem cell proliferation or adhesion rates. In conclusion, cathepsin D and its precursors enhance mesenchymal stem cell homing towards tumour sites, most likely by enzymatic mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Despite evidence linking the human microbiome to health and disease, how the microbiota affects human physiology remains largely unknown. Microbiota-encoded metabolites are expected to play an integral role in human health. Therefore, assigning function to these metabolites is critical to understanding these complex interactions and developing microbiota-inspired therapies. Here, we use large-scale functional screening of molecules produced by individual members of a simplified human microbiota to identify bacterial metabolites that agonize G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Multiple metabolites, including phenylpropanoic acid, cadaverine, 9-10-methylenehexadecanoic acid, and 12-methyltetradecanoic acid, were found to interact with GPCRs associated with diverse functions within the nervous and immune systems, among others. Collectively, these metabolite-receptor pairs indicate that diverse aspects of human health are potentially modulated by structurally simple metabolites arising from primary bacterial metabolism.

Abstract: Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1)-specific ligase 1 (UFL1) is an important component of the UFM1 conjugation system, which is required for various cellular processes including protein translation, apoptosis, autophagy, and signal transduction. However, both, the expression of UFL1 in mammary cells and its role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we characterized the potential roles of UFL1 in BMECs. Amino acid sequence comparison indicated that bovine UFL1 shares a high level of sequence identity with the UFL1 of other ruminant species. Notably, UFL1 expression in BMECs was increased by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by treatment with tunicamycin (TM). ER stress-related gene expression was further increased in UFL1 knockdown cells upon TM treatment. Moreover, UFL1 overexpression inhibited TM-stimulated ER stress and alleviated ER stress-induced autophagy. Together, our results indicated that UFL1 is a novel ER stress-responsive protein in BMECs. Thus, our study provides a basis for further research into ER stress-related processes in bovine mammary tissues and potential targets for alleviating ER stress in these cells.

Abstract: This study was aimed to genetic profiling of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) gene in Murrah buffalo investigating 50 unrelated adult animals at ICAR-Research Complex for Eastern Region, Patna (India) in winter, spring, and summer. PCR ready genomic DNA samples and season-wise total RNA samples were prepared. The PCR products of Hsp70 eluted from agarose gel were sequenced and analyzed. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized and concentration was equalized to 25 ng/μl. Expression kinetics of mRNA transcripts in different seasons was studied using Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR technique and the data retrieved was analyzed by least-squares ANOVA. DNA sequencing by primer walking revealed four allelic variants of Hsp70 gene. Alignment study revealed one substitution in 5′UTR, six substitutions in coding region, and one addition in 3′UTR. The highest percent identity and negligible phylogenetic distance were found among the alleles and reference bovine sequences. The relative mRNA expression was significantly higher in summer when THI ≥ 84 than the spring and winter; fold change increased by 4.5 times in summer than the spring whereas found nearly half in winter. These findings can be useful for heat stress management in buffaloes and help in understanding the mechanism of thermo-regulation well.

Abstract: Summary
The Cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL) family is commonly hijacked by pathogens to redirect the host ubiquitin proteasome machinery to specific targets. During HIV infection, CRL5 is hijacked by HIV Vif to target viral restriction factors of the APOBEC3 family for ubiquitination and degradation. Here, using a quantitative proteomics approach, we identify the E3 ligase ARIH2 as a regulator of CRL5-mediated APOBEC3 degradation. The CUL5Vif/CBFß complex recruits ARIH2 where it acts to transfer ubiquitin directly to the APOBEC3 targets. ARIH2 is essential for CRL5-dependent HIV infectivity in primary CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, we show that ARIH2 cooperates with CRL5 to prime other cellular substrates for polyubiquitination, suggesting this may represent a general mechanism beyond HIV infection and APOBEC3 degradation. Taken together, these data identify ARIH2 as a co-factor in the Vif-hijacked CRL5 complex that contributes to HIV infectivity and demonstrate the operation of the E1-E2-E3/E3-substrate ubiquitination mechanism in a viral infection context.

Abstract: Summary
In the current model of endothelial barrier regulation, the tyrosine kinase SRC is purported to induce disassembly of endothelial adherens junctions (AJs) via phosphorylation of VE cadherin, and thereby increase junctional permeability. Here, using a chemical biology approach to temporally control SRC activation, we show that SRC exerts distinct time-variant effects on the endothelial barrier. We discovered that the immediate effect of SRC activation was to transiently enhance endothelial barrier function as the result of accumulation of VE cadherin at AJs and formation of morphologically distinct reticular AJs. Endothelial barrier enhancement via SRC required phosphorylation of VE cadherin at Y731. In contrast, prolonged SRC activation induced VE cadherin phosphorylation at Y685, resulting in increased endothelial permeability. Thus, time-variant SRC activation differentially phosphorylates VE cadherin and shapes AJs to fine-tune endothelial barrier function. Our work demonstrates important advantages of synthetic biology tools in dissecting complex signaling systems.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and heterogeneous disease that lacks clinically actionable genetic alterations that limit targeted therapies. Here we explore a systems pharmacology approach that integrates drug-target networks and large-scale genomic profiles of TNBC and identify wogonoside, one of the major active flavonoids, as a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. We validate that wogonoside attenuates cell migration, tube formation, and rat aorta microvessel outgrowth, and reduces formation of blood vessels in chicken chorioallantoic membrane and TNBC cell-induced Matrigel plugs. In addition, wogonoside inhibits growth and angiogenesis in TNBC cell xenograft models. This network-based approach predicts, and we empirically validate, wogonoside's antiangiogenic effects resulting from vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. Mechanistically, wogonoside inhibits Gli1 nuclear translocation and transcriptional activities associated with Hedgehog signaling, by promoting Smoothened degradation in a proteasome-dependent mechanism. This study offers a powerful, integrated, systems pharmacology-based strategy for oncological drug discovery and identifies wogonoside as a potential TNBC angiogenesis inhibitor.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant activation of caspase-6 (C6) in the absence of other hallmarks of apoptosis has been demonstrated in cells and tissues from patients with Huntington disease (HD) and animal models. C6 activity correlates with disease progression in patients with HD and the cleavage of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein is thought to strongly contribute to disease pathogenesis. Here we show that the mHTT1-586 fragment generated by C6 cleavage interacts with the zymogen form of the enzyme, stabilizing a conformation that contains an active site and is prone to full activation. This shift toward enhanced activity can be prevented by a small-molecule inhibitor that blocks the interaction between C6 and mHTT1-586. Molecular docking studies suggest that the inhibitor binds an allosteric site in the C6 zymogen. The interaction of mHTT1-586 with C6 may therefore promote a self-reinforcing, feedforward cycle of C6 zymogen activation and mHTT cleavage driving HD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Extreme diversity of the major Plasmodium falciparum antigen, PfEMP1, poses a barrier to identifying targets of immunity to malaria. Here, we used protein microarrays containing hundreds of variants of the DBLα domain of PfEMP1 to cover the diversity of Papua New Guinean (PNG) parasites. Probing the plasma of a longitudinal cohort of malaria-exposed PNG children showed that group 2 DBLα antibodies were moderately associated with a lower risk of uncomplicated malaria, whereas individual variants were only weakly associated with clinical immunity. In contrast, antibodies to 85 individual group 1 and 2 DBLα variants were associated with a 70%–100% reduction in severe malaria. Of these, 17 variants were strong predictors of severe malaria. Analysis of full-length PfEMP1 sequences from PNG samples shows that these 17 variants are linked to pathogenic CIDR domains. This suggests that whereas immunity to uncomplicated malaria requires a broad repertoire of antibodies, immunity to severe malaria targets a subset of conserved variants. These findings provide insights into antimalarial immunity and potential antibody biomarkers for disease risk.

Abstract: Thyroid hormone synthesis requires H2O2, produced by two NADPH oxidases, Duox1 and Duox2. To be fully active at the apical pole of the thyrocytes, these enzymes need additional maturation factors DuoxA1 and DuoxA2. The proteins have been shown to be localized at the cell surface, suggesting that they could form a complex with Duox counterparts. We have generated multiple HEK293 Tet-On3G cell lines that express various combinations of DuoxA upon doxycycline induction, in association with a constitutive expression of the Duox enzyme. We compared Duox specific activity, Duox/DuoxA cell surface interactions and the cellular consequences of sustained H2O2 generation. By normalizing H2O2 extracellular production by Duox or DuoxA membrane expression, we have demonstrated that the most active enzymatic complex is Duox2/DuoxA2, compared to Duox1/DuoxA1. A direct cell surface interaction was shown between Duox1/2 and both DuoxA1 and DuoxA2 using the Duolink® technology, Duox1/DuoxA1 and Duox2/DuoxA2 membrane complexes being more stable than the unpaired ones. A significant increase in DNA damage was observed in the nuclei of Duox2/DuoxA2 expressing cells after doxycycline induction and stimulation of Duox catalytic activity. The maturation and activity of Duox2 were drastically impaired when expressed with the glycosylation-defective maturation factor DuoxA2, while the impact of the unglycosylated DuoxA1 mutant on Duox1 membrane expression and activity was rather limited. The present data demonstrate for the first time that H2O2 produced by the Duox2/DuoxA2 cell surface enzymatic complex could provoke potential mutagenic DNA damage in an inducible cellular model, and highlight the importance of the co-expressed partner in the activity and stability of Duox/DuoxA complexes.

Abstract: Placental membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with the advantages of being non-invasive and having fewer ethical issues, are a promising source for cell therapy. Gestational diabetes (GDM) alters the uterine environment and may affect the therapeutic potential of MSCs derived from placenta. Therefore, we evaluated the biological properties of amniotic (AMSCs) and chorionic membrane MSCs (CMSCs) from human GDM placenta in order to explore their therapeutic potential. In comparison of GDM-/Healthy- CMSCs and AMSCs, the immunophenotypes and typical stellate morphology of MSC were similar in CMSCs irrespective of disease state while the MSC morphology in GDM-AMSCs was less evident. GDM- and Healthy- CMSCs displayed an enhanced proliferation rate and tri-lineage differentiation capacity compared with AMSCs. Notably, GDM-CMSCs had a significantly increased adipogenic ability than Healthy-CMSCs accompanied by increased transcriptional responsiveness of PPARγ and ADIPOQ induction. The secretome effect of Healthy- and GDM- CMSCs/AMSCs by using conditioned media and coculture experiments, suggests that GDM- and Healthy- CMSCs provided an equivalent immunoregulatory effect on suppressing T-cells activation but a reduced effect of GDM-CMSCs on macrophage regulation. However, Healthy- and GDM- CMSCs displayed a superior immunomodulatory capacity in regulation of both T-cells and macrophages than AMSCs. In summary, we highlight the importance of the maternal GDM intrauterine environment during pregnancy and its impact on CMSCs/AMSCs proliferation ability, CMSCs adipogenic potential, and macrophage regulatory capacity.

Abstract: Summary
The temporal order of DNA replication is regulated during development and is highly correlated with gene expression, histone modifications and 3D genome architecture. We tracked changes in replication timing, gene expression, and chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) A/B compartments over the first two cell cycles during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to definitive endoderm. Remarkably, transcriptional programs were irreversibly reprogrammed within the first cell cycle and were largely but not universally coordinated with replication timing changes. Moreover, changes in A/B compartment and several histone modifications that normally correlate strongly with replication timing showed weak correlation during the early cell cycles of differentiation but showed increased alignment in later differentiation stages and in terminally differentiated cell lines. Thus, epigenetic cell fate transitions during early differentiation can occur despite dynamic and discordant changes in otherwise highly correlated genomic properties.

Abstract: Summary
Organotypic culture systems from disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) exhibit obvious advantages compared with immortalized cell lines and primary cell cultures, but implementation of iPSC-based high-throughput (HT) assays is still technically challenging. Here, we demonstrate the development and conduction of an organotypic HT Cl−/I− exchange assay using cystic fibrosis (CF) disease-specific iPSCs. The introduction of a halide-sensitive YFP variant enabled automated quantitative measurement of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) function in iPSC-derived intestinal epithelia. CFTR function was partially rescued by treatment with VX-770 and VX-809, and seamless gene correction of the p.Phe508del mutation resulted in full restoration of CFTR function. The identification of a series of validated primary hits that improve the function of p.Phe508del CFTR from a library of ∼42,500 chemical compounds demonstrates that the advantages of complex iPSC-derived culture systems for disease modeling can also be utilized for drug screening in a true HT format.

Abstract: Cigarette smoke (CS) is the primary risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and dampens antiviral response, which increases viral infections and leads to COPD acute exacerbation (AECOPD). Adenovirus, a nonenveloped DNA virus, is linked with AECOPD, whose DNAs trigger innate immune response via interacting with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Stimulator of interferon genes (STING), as a cytosolic DNA sensor, participates in adenovirus-induced interferon β (IFNβ)-dependent antiviral response. STING is involved in various pulmonary diseases, but role of STING in pathogenesis of AECOPD is not well documented. In the present study, we explored relationship between STING and AECOPD induced by recombinant adenovirus vectors (rAdVs) and CS in wild type (WT) and STING-/- mice; and also characterized the inhibition of STING- IFNβ pathway in pulmonary epithelium exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). We found that CS or CSE exposure alone dramatically inhibited STING expression, but not significantly effected IFNβ production. Moreover, CS or CSE-exposed significantly suppressed activation of STING-IFNβ pathway induced by rAdVs and suppressed clearance of rAdVs DNA. Inflammation, fibrosis and emphysema of lung tissues were exaggerated when treated with CS plus rAdVs, which further deteriorate in absences of STING. In A549 cells with knockdown of STING, we also observed enhancing apoptosis related to emphysema, especially CSE and adenovirus vectors in combination. Therefore, STING may play a protective role in preventing the progress of COPD.

Abstract: Myofibroblasts are characterized by de novo expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and play a key role in tissue repair and remodeling. In addition to TGF-β1, recent studies have shown that nerve growth factor (NGF) has effects on myofibroblast differentiation and collagen synthesis. However, the regulatory mechanism remains poorly defined. NGF effects are mediated by the specific expression of the NGF neurotrophic tropomyosin-receptor kinase A (TrkA) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Using NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell lines, we examined the induction of myofibroblast differentiation stimulated by NGF. Our findings showed that p75NTR was in keeping with the expression of α-SMA. Herein, we investigated the role of p75NTR in NGF-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen synthesis in these cells using lentivirus transfection to overexpress and knock down. Our results showed that p75NTR was preferentially expressed and was sufficient to induce actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which was required for NGF-induced α-SMA expression. Furthermore, NGF induced nuclear translocation of MRTF-A, an effect that was regulated by p75NTR, and required for α-SMA and collagen-I expression in myofibroblasts. Using a novel MRTF-A pathway inhibitor, CCG-203971, we further demonstrated the requirement of MRTF-A nuclear localization and activity in NGF-induced α-SMA expression. In conclusion, we conclude that p75NTR regulates NGF-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen synthesis through MRTF-A. Regulation of NGF-p75NTR interactions represents a promising therapy for fibrotic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Prevotella copri is a common human gut microbe that has been both positively and negatively associated with host health. In a cross-continent meta-analysis exploiting >6,500 metagenomes, we obtained >1,000 genomes and explored the genetic and population structure of P. copri. P. copri encompasses four distinct clades (>10% inter-clade genetic divergence) that we propose constitute the P. copri complex, and all clades were confirmed by isolate sequencing. These clades are nearly ubiquitous and co-present in non-Westernized populations. Genomic analysis showed substantial functional diversity in the complex with notable differences in carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that multi-generational dietary modifications may be driving reduced prevalence in Westernized populations. Analysis of ancient metagenomes highlighted patterns of P. copri presence consistent with modern non-Westernized populations and a clade delineation time pre-dating human migratory waves out of Africa. These findings reveal that P. copri exhibits a high diversity that is underrepresented in Western-lifestyle populations.

Abstract: Fibronectin is a multifunctional, extracellular matrix glycoprotein that exists either as an insoluble multimeric fibrillar component of the extracellular matrix or as a soluble monomer. Cells attach to fibronectin through transmembrane integrin receptors and form a variety of cell-matrix contacts. Here we show that primary fibroblasts can use fibronectin to organize a specific cell-cell contact – “stitch adhesions.” This contact is formed by short parallel fibronectin fibrils connecting adjacent cells above the level of the focal adhesions that attach the cells to the substrate. Stitch adhesions contain integrin α5β1 but not αVβ3, align with actin filament bundles, and contain talin, tensin, α-actinin, vinculin, paxillin and a phosphorylated form of focal adhesion kinase. This combination of components differs from the described constituents of the known cell adhesions. Stitch adhesions are organized when protein synthesis and secretion are inhibited by cycloheximide and exogenous fibronectin is provided to the cells. The adhesion stitches described here provide an attractive model system for studying fibronectin fibrillogenesis and the mechanisms governing the formation of cellular adhesions.

Abstract: Human anterior gradient-2 (AGR2), a member of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, is upregulated in various human cancers and reportedly has oncogenic activities. However, the functional roles of AGR2 and its regulation in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. Here, we showed that AGR2 promoted CRC tumorigenesis and progression in vitro and in vivo and acted as an independent prognostic factor of poor outcome. AGR2 was negatively regulated by DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) through directly methylating AGR2 promoter and by a DNMT3a–SPRY2–miR-194 axis. Moreover, AGR2 mediated the resistance to 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) treatment. Knockdown of AGR2 improved the therapeutic effect of 5-Aza in human CRC xenograft tumor model. Thus, our work supports AGR2's oncogenic role in CRC, reveals DNMT3a-mediated epigenetic modulation on AGR2 promoter, and uncovers a new DNMT3a signaling module controlling expression of AGR2. Upregulated AGR2 offset 5-Aza mediated epigenetic therapy. This work might provide potential targets for clinical anti-cancer therapy.

Abstract: Biological phenotypes of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are regulated by a series of biochemical elements, including microRNAs, hormones and growth factors. Our previous study illustrated a significant role of miR-141-3p during the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs). Nevertheless, the functions of miR-141-3p in regulating the proliferative ability and senescence of SCAPs have not been determined. This study identified that overexpression of miR-141-3p inhibited the proliferative ability of SCAPs. Meanwhile, the senescence of SCAPs was ahead of time. Conversely, transfection of miR-141-3p inhibitor promoted the proliferative ability of SCAPs and delayed their senescence. Yes-associated protein (YAP) was predicted as the downstream target gene of miR-141-3p by online softwares (miRDB, miRTarBase, miRWalk, and TargetScan), and was further verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Additionally, knockdown of YAP inhibited the proliferation and accelerated the senescence of SCAPs. Collectively, these findings proposed a novel direction that miR-141-3p impeded proliferative ability and promoted senescence of SCAPs through post-transcriptionally downregulating YAP.

Abstract: Summary
Interorgan immunological communication is critical to connect the local-systemic innate immune response and orchestrate a homeostatic host defense. However, the factors and their roles in this process remain unclear. We find Drosophila IMD response in guts can sequentially trigger a systemic IMD reaction in the fat body. Sugar alcohols of the polyol pathway are essential for the spatiotemporal regulation of gut-fat body immunological communication (GFIC). IMD activation in guts causes elevated levels of sorbitol and galactitol in hemolymph. Aldose reductase (AR) in hemocytes, the rate-limiting enzyme of the polyol pathway, is necessary and sufficient for the increase of plasma sugar alcohols. Sorbitol relays GFIC by subsequent activation of Metalloprotease 2, which cleaves PGRP-LC to activate IMD response in fat bodies. Thus, this work unveils how GFIC relies on the intermediate activation of the polyol pathway in hemolymph and demonstrates that AR provides a critical metabolic checkpoint in the global inflammatory response.

Abstract: Telomeropathies are a group of phenotypically heterogeneous diseases molecularly unified by pathogenic mutations in telomere-maintenance genes causing critically short telomeres. X-linked dyskeratosis congenita (DC), the prototypical telomere disease, manifested with ectodermal dysplasia, cancer predisposition, and severe bone marrow failure, is caused by mutations in DKC1, encoding a protein responsible for telomerase holoenzyme complex stability. To investigate the effects of pathogenic DKC1 mutations on telomere repair and hematopoietic development, we derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts of a DC patient carrying the most frequent mutation: DKC1 p.A353V. Telomeres eroded immediately after reprogramming in DKC1-mutant iPSCs but stabilized in later passages. The telomerase activity of mutant iPSCs was comparable to that observed in human embryonic stem cells, and no evidence of alternative lengthening of telomere pathways was detected. Hematopoietic differentiation was carried out in DKC1-mutant iPSC clones that resulted in increased capacity to generate hematopoietic colony-forming units compared to controls. Our study indicates that telomerase-dependent telomere maintenance is defective in pluripotent stem cells harboring DKC1 mutation and unable to elongate telomeres, but sufficient to maintain cell proliferation and self-renewal, as well as to support the primitive hematopoiesis, the program that is recapitulated with our differentiation protocol.

Abstract: As an extension of their orchestration of intracellular pathways, secretion of extracellular heat shock proteins (HSPs) is an emerging paradigm of homeostasis imperative to multicellular organization. Extracellular HSP is axiomatic to the survival of cells during tumorigenesis; proportional representation of specific HSP family members is indicative of invasive potential and prognosis. Further significance has been added by the knowledge that all cancer-derived exosomes have surface-exposed HSPs that reflect the membrane topology of cells that secrete them. Extracellular HSPs are also characteristic of chronic inflammation and sepsis. Accordingly, interrogation of extracellular HSPs secreted from cell culture models may represent a facile means of identifying translational biomarker signatures for targeting in situ. In the current study, we evaluated a simple peptide-based multivalent HSP affinity approach using the Vn96 peptide for low speed pelleting of HSP complexes from bioreactor cultures of cell lines with varying invasive phenotype in xenotransplant models: U87 (glioblastoma multiforme; invasive); HELA (choriocarcinoma; minimally invasive); HEK293T (virally transformed immortalized; embryonic). Proteomic profiling by bottom-up mass spectrometry revealed a comprehensive range of candidate biomarkers including primary HSP ligands. HSP complexes were associated with additional chaperones of prognostic significance such as protein disulfide isomerases, as well as pleiotropic metabolic enzymes, established as proportionally reflective of invasive phenotype. Biomarkers of inflammatory and mechanotransductive phenotype were restricted to the most invasive cell model U87, including chitinase CHI3L1, lamin C, amyloid derivatives, and histone isoforms.

Abstract: Regulatory B cells (Breg cells) play critical roles in modulating immune responses during autoimmune diseases and infection. Here we explored the participation of two main Breg subsets, including IL-10+ Breg (B10) and IL-35+ Breg cells, in maintaining successful pregnancy. We first observed an elevated percentage of B10 cells in peripheral blood from first-trimester pregnant women compared with non-pregnant controls. Serum from pregnancy induced the augmentation of B10  in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from non-pregnant women. In animal models, we demonstrated that there were significant augmentation of B10 cells and obvious increase of IL-10 level in splenic B cells from normal pregnant mice compared to that in abortion-prone pregnant mice and virgin mice. Further analysis showed that both hCG and IL-35 suppressed the proliferation of mouse splenic B cells. Moreover, IL-35 induced the expansion of both mouse splenic B10 and IL-35+ Breg cells while hCG only mediated the generation of B10 cells. Subsequent study in mice demonstrated that the activation of STAT1 and STAT3 in B cells caused by IL-35 and the activation of STAT3 caused by hCG were the predominant mechanism of IL-35+ Breg and B10 cells augmentation. These findings suggested that hCG and IL-35 induced the amplification of B10 and IL-35+ Breg cells which played a vital peripheral regulatory role during pregnancy.

Abstract: Summary
The cerebrum is a major center for brain function, and its activity is derived from the assembly of activated cells in neural networks. It is currently difficult to study complex human cerebral neuronal network activity. Here, using cerebral organoids, we report self-organized and complex human neural network activities that include synchronized and non-synchronized patterns. Self-organized neuronal network formation was observed following a dissociation culture of human embryonic stem cell-derived cerebral organoids. The spontaneous individual and synchronized activity of the network was measured via calcium imaging, and subsequent analysis enabled the examination of detailed cell activity patterns, providing simultaneous raster plots, cluster analyses, and cell distribution data. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of our system to assess drug-inducible dynamic changes of the network activity. The comprehensive functional analysis of human neuronal networks using this system may offer a powerful tool to access human brain function.

Abstract: Activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ agonists) are therapeutically promising candidates against insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Synthetic PPARγ agonists are known to effectively enhance insulin sensitivity, but these are also associated with adverse side-effects and rising cost of treatment. Therefore, natural PPARγ targeting ligands are desirable alternatives for the management of insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes. Phloretin (PT) and Phloridzin (PZ) are predominant apple phenolics, which are recognized for their various pharmacological functions. The present study assessed the potential of PT and PZ in enhancing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by inhibiting Cdk5 activation and corresponding PPARγ phosphorylation in differentiated 3T3L1 cells. In silico docking and subsequent validation using 3T3L1 cells revealed that PT and PZ not only block the ser273 site of PPARγ but also inhibit the activation of Cdk5 itself, thereby, indicating their potent PPARγ regulatory attributes. Corroborating this, application of PT and PZ significantly enhanced the accumulation of cellular triglycerides as well as expression of insulin-sensitizing genes in adipocytes ultimately resulting in improved glucose uptake. Taken together, the present study reports that PT and PZ inhibit Cdk5 activation, which could be directly influencing the apparent PPARγ inhibition at ser273, ultimately resulting in improved insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake.

Abstract: Cardiac microvascular ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury has been a neglected topic in recent decades. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism underlying microvascular IR injury, with a focus on mitochondrial homeostasis. We also explored the protective role of tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) in microvascular protection in the context of IR injury. Through animal studies and cell experiments, we demonstrated that IR injury mediated microvascular wall destruction, lumen stenosis, perfusion defects, and cardiac microvascular endothelial cell (CMEC) apoptosis via inducing mitochondrial damage. In contrast, Tan IIA administration had the ability to sustain CMEC viability and microvascular homeostasis, finally attenuating microvascular IR injury. Function studies have confirmed that the SIRT1/PGC1α pathway is responsible for the microvascular protection from the Tan IIA treatment. SIRT1 activation by Tan IIA sustained the mitochondrial potential, alleviated the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factor leakage, reduced the mPTP opening, and blocked mitochondrial apoptosis, providing a survival advantage for CMECs and preserving microvascular structure and function. By comparison, inhibiting SIRT1 abrogated the beneficial effects of Tan IIA on mitochondrial function, CMEC survival, and microvascular homeostasis. Collectively, this study indicated that Tan IIA should be considered a microvascular-protective drug that alleviates acute cardiac microcirculation IR injury via activating the SIRT1/PGC1α pathway and thereby blocking mitochondrial damage.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1) is a conserved H3-H4 histone chaperone involved in histone dynamics during replication, transcription, and DNA repair. Overexpressed in proliferating tissues including many tumors, ASF1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. Here, we combine structural, computational, and biochemical approaches to design peptides that inhibit the ASF1-histone interaction. Starting from the structure of the human ASF1-histone complex, we developed a rational design strategy combining epitope tethering and optimization of interface contacts to identify a potent peptide inhibitor with a dissociation constant of 3 nM. When introduced into cultured cells, the inhibitors impair cell proliferation, perturb cell-cycle progression, and reduce cell migration and invasion in a manner commensurate with their affinity for ASF1. Finally, we find that direct injection of the most potent ASF1 peptide inhibitor in mouse allografts reduces tumor growth. Our results open new avenues to use ASF1 inhibitors as promising leads for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Background/Aims
The NOD-like receptor, pyrin domain containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in the progression of chronic kidney disease in several rodent models. Here, we investigated whether a specific inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome, MCC950, can attenuate cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis.
Materials
Renal fibrosis was induced via a series of three injections of cisplatin to male C57BL/6 mice (7.5 mg/kg body weight). Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was detected by immunoblotting, real-time PCR, and immunofluorescence. To validate the protective effect of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, MCC950(20 mg/kg body weight) was daily injected into multiple-cisplatin-treated mice intraperitoneally for 14 days, starting from 4 weeks after the first dose of cisplatin. NLRP3-/- mice were used to confirm the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis.
Results
Mice were euthanized at 6 weeks after the first dose of cisplatin treatment. In multiple-cisplatin-induced murine model, renal fibrosis was accompanied by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. MCC950, the specific inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome, reduced cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction, tubular damage, interstitial collagen deposit, and the expression of profibrotic parameters. NLRP3 inhibition might protect against cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis through the alleviation of oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by deleting NLRP3 gene halted the progression of cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis.
Conclusion
Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome attenuates renal fibrosis due to repeated cisplatin injections, and might be identified as a potential target for attenuating cisplatin-induced chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stromal cells are key components of hematopoietic niches in the bone marrow. Here we abrogated transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling in mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPCs) by deleting Tgfbr2 in mesenchymal cells using a doxycycline-repressible Sp7 (osterix)-Cre transgene. We show that loss of TGF-β signaling during fetal development results in a marked expansion of CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells and adipocytes in the bone marrow, while osteoblasts are significantly reduced. These stromal alterations are associated with significant defects in hematopoiesis, including a shift from lymphopoiesis to myelopoiesis. However, hematopoietic stem cell function is preserved. Interestingly, TGF-β signaling is dispensable for the maintenance of mesenchymal cells in the bone marrow after birth under steady-state conditions. Collectively, these data show that TGF-β plays an essential role in the lineage specification of fetal but not definitive MSPCs and is required for the establishment of normal hematopoietic niches in fetal and perinatal bone marrow.

Abstract: Heat stress (HS) seriously affects animal performance. In view of global warming, it is essential to understand the regulatory mechanisms by which animals adapt to heat stress. In this study, our aim was to explore the genes and pathways involved in heat stress in sheep. To this end, we used transcriptome analysis to understand the molecular responses to heat stress and thereby identify means to protect sheep from heat shock. To obtain an overview of the effects of heat stress on sheep, we used the hypothalamus for transcriptome sequencing and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs; false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01; fold change > 2) during heat stress. A total of 1423 DEGs (1122 upregulated and 301 downregulated) were identified and classified into Gene Ontology (GO) categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Heat stress triggered dramatic and complex alterations in gene expression in the hypothalamus. We hypothesized that heat stress induced apoptosis and dysfunction in cells and vital organs and affected growth, development, reproduction, and circadian entrainment via the calcium signaling pathway, which influences ribosome assembly and function. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the expression of the genes regulating important biological functions or whose expression profiles were significantly changed after acute heat stress (FDR < 0.01; fold change > 4), and the results showed that the expression patterns of these genes were consistent with the results of transcriptome sequencing, indicating that the credibility of the sequencing results. Our data indicated that heat stress induced calcium dyshomeostasis, blocked biogenesis, caused ROS accumulation, impaired the antioxidant system and innate defense, and induced apoptosis through the P53 signaling pathway activated by PEG3, decreased growth and development, and enhanced organ damage. These data is very important and helpful to elucidate the molecular mechanism of heat stress and finally to find ways to deal with heat stress damage in sheep.

Abstract: End binding protein 1 (EB1) is a key regulator of microtubule dynamics that orchestrates hierarchical interaction networks at microtubule plus ends to control proper cell division. EB1 activity is known to be regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation; however, how tyrosine phosphorylation affects EB1 activity remains poorly understood. In this study, we mapped the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of EB1 in synchronized cells and identified two tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Y217 and Y247) in mitotic cells. Using phospho-deficient (Y/F) and phospho-mimic (Y/D) mutants, we revealed that Y247, but not Y217, is critical for astral microtubule stability. The Y247D mutant contributed to increased spindle angle, indicative of defects in spindle orientation. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that the Y247D mutant significantly delayed mitotic progression by increasing the duration times of prometaphase and metaphase. Structural analysis suggests that Y247 mutants lead to instability of the hydrophobic cavity in the EB homology (EBH) domain, thereby affecting its interactions with p150glued, a protein essential for Gαi/LGN/NuMA complex capture. These findings uncover a crucial role for EB1 phosphorylation in the regulation of mitotic spindle orientation and cell division.

Abstract: Summary
In vertebrates, estrogen receptors are essential for estrogen-associated early gonadal sex development. Our previous studies revealed sexual dimorphic expression of estrogen receptor β2 (ERβ2) during embryogenesis of medaka, and here we investigated the functional importance of ERβ2 in female gonad development and maintenance using a transgenerational ERβ2-knockdown (ERβ2-KD) line and ERβ2-null mutants. We found that ERβ2 reduction favored male-biased gene transcription, suppressed female-responsive gene expression, and affected SDF1a and CXCR4b co-assisted chemotactic primordial germ cell (PGC) migration. Co-overexpression of SDF1a and CXXR4b restored the ERβ2-KD/KO associated PGC mismigration. Further analysis confirmed that curtailment of ERβ2 increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, disrupted intra- and extracellular calcium homeostasis, and instigated autophagic germ cell degradation and germ cell loss, which in some cases ultimately affected the XX female sexual development. This study is expected improve our understanding of germ cell maintenance and sex spectrum, and hence open new avenues for reproductive disorder management.

Abstract: Summary
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) that express high levels of stem cell factor (SCF) and CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) are one crucial component of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. While the secreted factors produced by BMSCs to support HSCs have been well described, little is known regarding the transcriptional regulators controlling the cell fate of BMSCs and thus indirectly maintaining HSCs. BMI1 is a polycomb group protein that regulates HSCs both cell intrinsically and extrinsically, but it is unknown in which cell type and how BMI1 functions to maintain HSCs extrinsically. Here we show that Bmi1 maintains HSCs by preventing adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Bmi1 is highly expressed in BMSCs but becomes downregulated upon adipogenic differentiation and during aging. Deleting Bmi1 from BMSCs increased marrow adipocytes, induced HSC quiescence and depletion, and impaired hematopoiesis. We found that BMI1 repressed multiple developmental programs in BMSCs by safeguarding the repressive epigenetic marks histone H2A ubiquitylation and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. We identified a novel adipogenic program governed by Pax3, which BMI1 repressed in BMSCs. Our results establish Bmi1 as a critical regulator of BMSC cell fate that suppresses marrow adipogenesis to create a supportive niche for HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Thioflavin T (ThT) is widely used for the detection of amyloids. Many unrelated DNAs and RNAs that contain G-quadruplex motifs also bind ThT and strongly activate its fluorescence. To elucidate the structural basis of ThT binding to G quadruplexes and its fluorescence turn-on, we determined its co-crystal structure with the homodimeric RNA Corn, which contains two G quadruplexes. We found that two ThT molecules bind in the dimer interface, constrained by a G quartet from each protomer into a maximally fluorescent planar conformation. The unliganded Corn homodimer crystal structure reveals a collapsed fluorophore-binding site. In solution, Corn must fluctuate between this and an open, binding-competent conformation. A co-crystal structure with another benzothiazole derivate, thiazole orange (TO), also shows binding at the Corn homodimer interface.

Abstract: As detoxification enzymes, proteins in the glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily are reported to participate in oxidative stress resistance. Nevertheless, microsomal GSTs (MGSTs), a unique subclass of the GST superfamily associated with membranes, are rarely studied in insects. Here, we isolated an MGST gene in Apis cerana cerana (AccMGST1) and verified its role in oxidative stress response. We found higher expression of AccMGST1 in protective or defensive tissue, that is, the epidermis, which indicated its role in stress resistance. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that AccMGST1 was upregulated by oxidative stresses at the transcriptional level. In contrast, AccMGST1 expression was inhibited when the antioxidant vitamin C (VC) was fed to experimental bees. Through western blotting, we found that the protein level of AccMGST1 under oxidative stress corresponded to the transcript level. Disc diffusion and mixed-function oxidation (MFO) assays suggested that AccMGST1 can protect not only cells but also DNA against oxidative damage. Furthermore, we discovered that the expression patterns of known antioxidant genes were changed in A. cerana cerana after AccMGST1 was silenced by RNA interference (RNAi). Thus, we concluded that the gene AccMGST1 exerts a significant role in the antioxidant mechanism.

Abstract: Actin is highly abundant in platelets, and its function is dependent on its structure. Actin filaments (F-actin) are dynamic structures involved in many cellular processes including platelet shape changes and adhesion. The actin cytoskeleton is tightly regulated by actin-binding proteins, which include members of the actin depolymerising factor (ADF)/cofilin family. LIM kinase (LIMK) and its phosphatase slingshot (SSH-1L) regulate actin dynamics by controlling the binding affinity of ADF/cofilin towards actin. We hypothesised that the inhibition of LIMK activity may prevent the changes in platelet shape and their function during activation by controlling the dynamics of F-actin. Our results demonstrate that in platelet, inhibition of LIMK by small LIMK inhibitors controls the level of filamentous actin leading to decreased platelet adhesion and aggregation. These findings encourage further studies on controlling platelet function via the cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to play a significant role in various malignant tumors, yet their potential functions in gastric cancer are not clear. In this study, we found a novel lncRNA, named TONSL-AS1, was downregulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines compared with the normal. TONSL-AS1 inhibited cell migration, invasion and proliferation in SGC‐7901, MGC‐803 cells. Furthermore, TONSL-AS1 could suppress cell tumorigenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, TONSL-AS1's genomic neighboring gene TONSL, which was reported as a tumor suppress gene, was upregulated by TONSL. Additionally, the TONSL-AS1 was positively associated with TONSL in cancer tissues. Our study revealed that the tumor-inhibiting effect of TONSL-AS1 in gastric cancer cells was associated with TONSL. In general, our results indicated that TONSL-AS1 works as a tumor suppressor lncRNA, which may be a new therapeutic target for gastric cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have demonstrated that human astrocytes and fibroblasts can be directly converted into functional neurons by small molecules. However, fibroblasts, as a potentially better cell resource for transplantation, are not as easy to reprogram as astrocytes regarding their fate to neurons, and chemically induced neurons (iNs) with low efficiency from fibroblasts resulted in limited application for the treatment of neurological disorders, including depression. Here, we report that human fibroblasts can be efficiently and directly reprogrammed into glutamatergic neuron-like cells by serially exposing cells to a combination of small molecules. These iNs displayed neuronal transcriptional networks, and also exhibited mature firing patterns and formed functional synapses. Importantly, iNs could integrate into local circuits after transplantation into postnatal mouse brain. Our study provides a rapid and efficient transgene-free approach for chemically generating neuron-like cells from human fibroblasts. Furthermore, our approach offers strategies for disease modeling and drug discovery in central nervous system disorders.

Abstract: Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are proteins/lipids that are glycated upon sugar exposure and are often increased during inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we developed an extracellular matrix (ECM) using glycated type I collagen (ECM-GC), which produced similar levels of AGEs to those detected in the sera of arthritic mice. In order to determine whether AGEs were sufficient to stimulate sensory neurons, dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) cells were cultured on ECM-GC or ECM-NC-coated plates. ECM-GC or ECM-NC were favorable for DRG cells expansion. However, ECM-GC cultivated neurons displayed thinner F-actin filaments, rounded morphology, and reduced neuron interconnection compared to ECM-NC. In addition, ECM-GC did not affect RAGE expression levels in the neurons, although induced rapid p38, MAPK and ERK activation. Finally, ECM-GC stimulated the secretion of nitrite and TNF-α by DRG cells. Taken together, our in vitro glycated ECM model suitably mimics the in vivo microenvironment of inflammatory disorders and provides new insights into the role of ECM impairment as a nociceptive stimulus.

Abstract: Radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE) are discussed as relevant processes during radiotherapy. Irradiated cells are suggested to release growth-inhibitory/DNA-damaging factors transported to non-irradiated cells. However, the molecular nature of this phenomenon has not yet been resolved. We aimed at identifying the growth-inhibitory factor(s) transmitted to non-irradiated cells. RIBE-competent PC3 cells were used to produce conditioned medium (CM) after exposure to ionizing radiation. Indicator cells were incubated with CM and clonogenic survival as well as cell proliferation were determined as endpoints. A549 indicator cells exhibited a bystander effect upon incubation with CM from irradiated PC3 cells. This bystander effect was not due to DNA-damaging factors, but a radiation-triggered reduction of mitogenic/clonogenic activity present in CM. Several tumor cells, but not normal fibroblasts secrete this factor, whose release is reduced by irradiation. We identified L-Plastin to be responsible for the mitogenic/clonogenic activity. Removal of L-Plastin from CM by immunoprecipitation or siRNA-mediated knockdown of L-Plastin expression resulted in loss or reduction of mitogenic/clonogenic activity transmitted via CM, respectively. Exosome-transported L-Plastin was constitutively Ser5-phosphorylated, indicative of its bioactive conformation. In summary, we observed production and exosomal secretion of L-Plastin by cancer cells. Via exosome-transmitted L-Plastin, tumors induce clonogenic and mitogenic activity in cancer and normal cells of the tumor microenvironment. Irradiation inhibits L-Plastin production targeting both cancer cells and the tumor niche and may explain the high impact of radiotherapy in tumor control.

Abstract: Diabetic nephrology (DN) is attributed largely to the depletion of podocytes, which is closely associated to apoptosis. However, the complex mechanism of podocyte loss in DN pathogenesis remains unclear. Recently, necroptosis has emerged as an important cell death model in many pathological conditions, which is regulated through RIPK1/RIPK3 pathway. In addition, necroptosis was found to share several upstream signaling pathways with apoptosis. Therefore, it was speculated that both apoptosis and necroptosis may occur in podocytes during the process of podocyte injury in DN. Herein, necroptosis and apoptosis were shown to be involved in podocyte injury induced by high glucose (HG), both in vitro and in vivo, with a high level of positive signaling markers RIPK1 (298.4 ± 17.35), cleaved caspase 3 (497.1 ± 23.09), RIPK3 (108.4 ± 14.92), and MLKL (470.4 ± 15.73) than the control groups. Scaning electron microscopy examination revealed the morphological characteristics of necroptotic and apoptotic cells, which differed remarkably. z-VAD-fmk, a pan-inhibitor of apoptosis, could block apoptosis and enhance necroptosis. Furthermore, UCHL1 was found to play a major role in promoting podocyte necroptosis by regulating the ubiquitination state of the RIPK1/RIPK3 pathway. The half-life of RIPK1 and RIPK3 proteins reduced and the expression of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL decreased significantly after the knockdown of UCHL1. It was shown that UCHL1 exerted a more regulatory response to necroptosis. These data suggested that necroptosis may have more effect on the loss of podocytes than apoptosis in DN with the regulation of UCHL1. Thus, inhibiting UCHL1 to downregulate the RIPK1/RIPK3 pathway may be a novel strategy to protect the podocytes in DN patients.

Abstract: Liver Cholestasis is a widespread disease of broad etiologies and ultimately results in fibrosis, which is still lacking effective therapeutic strategies. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is the key event of liver fibrosis. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of the Slit2 signaling in cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis. Our findings revealed that the serum levels and hepatic expression of Slit2 were significantly increased in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Additionally, Slit2-Tg mice were much more vulnerable to BDL-induced liver injury and fibrosis compared to WT control. Slit2 up-regulation by Slit2 recombinant protein induced proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis of human HSCs cell line LX-2 via p38 and ERK signaling pathway, resulting in the activation of HSCs. In contrast, Slit2 down-regulation by siRNA silencing inhibit the activation of HSCs. In conclusion, Slit2 is involved in the activation of HSCs and liver fibrogenesis, highlighting Slit2 as a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis.

Abstract: DPY30 facilitates H3K4 methylation by directly binding to ASH2L in the SET1/MLL complexes and plays an important role in hematologic malignancies. However, the domain on DPY30 that regulates cancer growth is not evident, and the potential of pharmacologically targeting this chromatin modulator to inhibit cancer has not been explored. Here we have developed a peptide-based strategy to specifically target DPY30 activity. We have designed cell-penetrating peptides derived from ASH2L that can either bind to DPY30 or show defective or enhanced binding to DPY30. The DPY30-binding peptides specifically inhibit DPY30's activity in interacting with ASH2L and enhancing H3K4 methylation. Treatment with the DPY30-binding peptides significantly inhibited the growth of MLL-rearranged leukemia and other MYC-dependent hematologic cancer cells. We also revealed subsets of genes that may mediate the effect of the peptides on cancer cell growth, and showed that the DPY30-binding peptide sensitized leukemia to other types of epigenetic inhibitors. These results strongly support a critical role of the ASH2L-binding groove of DPY30 in promoting blood cancers, and demonstrate a proof-of-principle for the feasibility of pharmacologically targeting the ASH2L-binding groove of DPY30 for potential cancer inhibition.

Abstract: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complications of Type 2 Diabetes and its main pathological feature is myelin sheath damage of peripheral nerve that was induced by Schwann cells (SCs) apoptosis. Increasing evidence suggested that taurine might play a role in improving DPN because of its ability to prevent SCs apoptosis. In this study, we explore the effect of taurine on preventing SCs apoptosis and its underlying mechanism. Sprague Dawley rats were treated with streptozotocin to establish the diabetes model. Rats were randomly divided into control, diabetes, taurine treatment (as giving 0.5%, 1% and 2% taurine in drinking water) groups. RSC96 cell (a rat SCs line) was used for intervention experiments in vitro. Results showed that taurine significantly corrected morphology of damaged myelin sheath and inhibited SCs apoptosis in sciatic nerve of diabetic rats. Moreover, taurine prevented apoptosis of RSC96 cells exposed to high glucose. Mechanistically, taurine up-regulated NGF expression and phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3β, while, blocking activation of NGF and phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β increased apoptosis of high glucose-exposed RSC96 cells with taurine supplement. These results revealed taurine improved the myelin sheath damage of sciatic nerve in diabetic rats by controlling SCs apoptosis via NGF/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathways, which provides some clues that taurine might be effective and feasible candidate for the treatment of DPN.

Abstract: Heatstroke (HS) is an acute, progressive life-threatening emergency. Animals, including military working dogs (IDFMWD), rapidly activate cytoprotective processes, e.g., heat shock proteins (HSPs) and antioxidative molecules, in response to heat stress. We hypothesized that serum HSPs (eHSP72) and oxidative stress markers would differ in IDFMWD with a history of HS compared with controls and thus could be used to detect susceptibility to recurrent HS. eHSPs concentration, oxidative stress markers, and systemic physiological parameters were studied in dogs with and without histories of HS, undergoing indoor or outdoor training. Treadmill physical performance tests (PPTs) were conducted indoors at 22°C (groups C-I and HS-I) or outdoors under heat stress conditions of 36 °C; 60% humidity (groups C-O and HS-O). Pre-, immediately post-, and 45 min post-PPT heart rate (HR), respiratory rate, and rectal temperature (Tre) were recorded in all dogs. Likewise, blood samples were collected and eHSP72, venous blood gas analysis, and lactate and creatine kinase activity (CK) were assayed. Serum uric acid (sUA) and total serum redox potential (TRP) were measured only in the indoor group. Immediately post-PPT under both environmental conditions, Tre, HR, eHSP, sUA, and TRP (only measured in indoor PPT) significantly (P < 0.05) increased, whereas venous blood pH and bicarbonate decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Between groups comparisons demonstrated significant differences in basal HR and post-PPT Tre immediately after outdoor PPT. eHSP72 induction, CK, sUA, and serum TRP remained significantly higher in the HS group during post-PPT recovery. Taken together, animals with a history of HS have different results, and this signature of previous HS may predict altered heat sensitivity.

Abstract: This study focused on the alterations that occur in larval molluscan cells after administration of apoptotic inducers and inhibitors used in mammalian cells in response to cold stress. This is the first report on apoptosis modulation in molluscan cells assessed by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial activity, general caspase activation, and membrane integrity of control molluscan cells were compared to those processes in frozen–thawed molluscan cells, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human colon tumor cells prior to treatment and after incubation with apoptotic inducers or inhibitors. We tested three apoptotic inducers (staurosporine, camptothecin, and mitomycin C, routinely used for the chemical induction of apoptosis in different mammalian cells) and found that only staurosporine resulted in an evident apoptotic increase in molluscan cell cultures: 9.06% early apoptotic cells in comparison with 5.63% in control frozen–thawed cells and 20.6% late apoptotic cells in comparison with 10.68% in controls. Camptothecin did not significantly induce molluscan cell apoptosis but did cause a slight increase in the number of active cells after thawing. Mitomycin C produced similar results, but its effect was less pronounced. In addition, we hypothesize that the use of the apoptotic inhibitors could reduce apoptosis, which is significant after cryopreservation in molluscan cells; however, our attempts failed. Development in this direction is important for understanding the mechanisms of marine organisms’ cold susceptibility.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of cellular metabolic processes. Dysregulation of this kinase complex can result in a variety of human diseases. Rapamycin and its analogs target mTORC1 directly; however, chronic treatment in certain cell types and in vivo results in the inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. We have developed a high-throughput cell-based screen for the detection of phosphorylated forms of the mTORC1 (4E-BP1, S6K1) and mTORC2 (Akt) substrates and have identified and characterized a chemical scaffold that demonstrates a profile consistent with the selective inhibition of mTORC1. Stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture-based proteomic target identification revealed that class I glucose transporters were the primary target for these compounds yielding potent inhibition of glucose uptake and, as a result, selective inhibition of mTORC1. The link between the glucose uptake and selective mTORC1 inhibition are discussed in the context of a yet-to-be discovered glucose sensor.

Abstract: Environmental salinity is an important abiotic factor influencing normal physiological functions and productive performance in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. It is therefore important to understand how changes in salinity affect sea cucumbers in the face of global climate change. In this study, we investigated the responses to salinity stress in sea cucumbers using mRNA and miRNA sequencing. The regulatory network of mRNAs and miRNAs involved in salinity stress was examined, and the metabolic pathways enriched for differentially expressed miRNAs and target mRNAs were identified. The top 20 pathways were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, degradation, and elongation, amino acid metabolism, genetic information processing, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, transport and catabolism, and environmental information processing. A total of 22 miRNAs showed differential expression during salinity acclimation. The predicted 134 target genes were enriched in functions consistent with the results of gene enrichment based on transcriptome analysis. These results suggested that sea cucumbers deal with salinity stress via changes in amino acid metabolism, ion channels, transporters, and aquaporins, under stimulation by environmental signals, and that this process requires energy from carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism. Salinity challenge also induced miRNA expression. These results provide a valuable genomic resource that extends our understanding of the unique biological characteristics of this economically important species under conditions of salinity stress.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) can lead to microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities of the fetus. Although ZIKV vaccines that prevent or reduce viremia in non-pregnant mice have been described, a maternal vaccine that provides complete fetal protection would be desirable. Here, we show that adenovirus (Ad) vector-based ZIKV vaccines induce potent neutralizing antibodies that confer robust maternal and fetal protection against ZIKV challenge in pregnant, highly susceptible IFN-αβR−/− mice. Moreover, passive transfer of maternal antibodies from vaccinated dams protected pups against post-natal ZIKV challenge. These data suggest that Ad-based ZIKV vaccines may be able to provide protection in pregnant females against fetal ZIKV transmission in utero as well as in infants against ZIKV infection after birth.

Abstract: Skeletal myogenesis is a coordinated sequence of events associated with dramatic changes in cell morphology, motility, and metabolism, which causes cellular stress and alters proteostasis. Chaperones, such as heat-shock proteins (HSPs), play important roles in limiting cellular stresses and maintaining proteostasis, but whether HSPs are specifically involved in myogenesis is not well understood. Here, we characterized gene and protein expression and subcellular localization of various HSPs in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts and differentiating myotubes under control conditions and in response to heat stress. Hsp25, Hsp40, and Hsp60 protein expression declined by 48, 35, and 83%, respectively, during differentiation. In contrast, Hsp70 protein levels doubled during early differentiation. Hsp25 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm of myoblasts and myotubes but formed distinct aggregates in perinuclear spaces of myoblasts after heat-shock. Hsp40 was distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus and, after heat-shock, translocated to the nucleus of myoblasts but formed aggregates in myotubes. Hsp60 localized to the perinuclear space in myoblasts but was distributed more diffusely across the cytoplasm in myotubes. Hsp70 was expressed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus and translocated to the nucleus after heat-shock in myoblasts, but not in myotubes. Hsp90 was expressed diffusely across the cytoplasm in both myoblasts and myotubes under control conditions and did not change in response to heat-shock. These findings reveal distinct and different roles for HSPs in the regulation of myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been confirmed crucial regulators in tumorgenesis. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) has been recently shown to be dysregulated, which uncovered to be a potential oncogene in some cancers. However, the biological function and potential mechanism of SNHG16 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In our study, our observations showed that the expression level of SNHG16 in HCC tissues and cell lines was upregulated compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues and normal cells. In vitro, loss-of-function experiments revealed that SNHG16 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and weakened invasion of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells. miR-195 expression was significantly decreased in HCC tissues and negatively correlated with SNHG16 expression. Furthermore, RIP and dual luciferase reporter assays showed that SNHG16 acted as an endogenous sponge by directly binding to miR-195 and downregulated its expression. SNHG16 overexpression inverted the inhibitory effect of miR-195 on proliferation and invasion of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells. Additionally, SNHG16 depletion resulted in lower tumor growth and weight loss, in vivo. In conclusion, our findings reported that the oncogenic role of SNHG16 in HCC tumorigenesis through a novel SNHG16-miR-195 axis, which provided a novel insight for HCC and helped to probe a potential therapeutic target for the deadly disease.

Abstract: TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) plays a pivotal role in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms controlling its activity remain poorly understood. Here, we show that leucine-rich repeat containing 62 (LRRC62), a previously uncharacterized protein, negatively regulates TLR signaling by targeting TAK1. Expression of LRRC62 inhibits the TLRs-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokine, whereas deficiency in LRRC62 enhances the activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling and increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Mechanically, LRRC62 functions as an adaptor to recruit deubiquitinase CYLD to TAK1, thus inhibits the K63-linked poly-ubiquitination and activation of TAK1. Together, our findings uncover an unrecognized mechanism by which LRRC62 antagonizes the activation of TAK1 in a CYLD-mediated deubiquitination-dependent manner, thereby balancing Toll-like receptor signaling to avert overzealous inﬂammation.

Abstract: In both unicellular and multicellular organisms, long-tailed class I myosins function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Myosin 1e (Myo1e) in vertebrates and Myo1 in fission yeast have similar domain organization, yet whether these proteins or their individual protein domains are functionally interchangeable remains unknown. In an effort to assess functional conservation of class I myosins, we tested whether human Myo1e could replace Myo1 in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and found that it was unable to substitute for yeast Myo1. To determine if any individual protein domain is responsible for the inability of Myo1e to function in yeast, we created human-yeast myosin-I chimeras. By functionally testing these chimeric myosins in vivo, we concluded that the Myo1e motor domain is unable to function in yeast, even when combined with the yeast Myo1 tail and a full complement of yeast regulatory light chains. Conversely, the Myo1e tail, when attached to the yeast Myo1 motor domain, supports localization to endocytic actin patches and partially rescues the endocytosis defect in myo1Δ cells. Further dissection showed that both the TH1 and TH2-SH3 domains in the human Myo1e tail are required for localization and function of chimeric myosin-I at endocytic sites. Overall, this study provides insights into the role of individual myosin-I domains, expands the utility of fission yeast as a simple model system to study the effects of disease-associated MYO1E mutations, and supports a model of co-evolution between a myosin motor and its actin track.

Abstract: We generated human iPS derived neural stem cells and differentiated cells from healthy control individuals and an individual with autism spectrum disorder carrying bi-allelic NRXN1-alpha deletion. We investigated the expression of NRXN1-alpha during neural induction and neural differentiation and observed a pivotal role for NRXN1-alpha during early neural induction and neuronal differentiation. Single cell RNA-seq pinpointed neural stem cells carrying NRXN1-alpha deletion shifting towards radial glia-like cell identity and revealed higher proportion of differentiated astroglia. Furthermore, neuronal cells carrying NRXN1-alpha deletion were identified as immature by single cell RNA-seq analysis, displayed significant depression in calcium signaling activity and presented impaired maturation action potential profile in neurons investigated with electrophysiology. Our observations propose NRXN1-alpha plays an important role for the efficient establishment of neural stem cells, in neuronal differentiation and in maturation of functional excitatory neuronal cells.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of astrocyte-derived exosomes (AS-Exo) on neuronal damage in ischemic stroke. We isolated astrocytes from 3- to 4-day-old C57BL/6 mice and astrocytes were identified by GFAP immunostaining. Exosomes were obtained from astrocyte supernatant by overspeed centrifugation. For investigating the effect of AS-Exo on the apoptosis of neurons after oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), the exosome labeling and uptake by neurons were observed by confocal laser microscopy, then HT-22 cell vitality and apoptosis were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, respectively. Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in OGD-induced HT-22 was analyzed by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Apoptosis-related protein in HT-22 was analyzed by Western blot. For investigating the effect of AS-Exo on the OGD neurons autophagy, expression of Beclin-1, LC3-I, LC3-II and P62 in OGD-induced HT-22 was analyzed by Western blot. For animal experiments, C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) models of middle cerebral artery occlusion were used to create permanent focal ischemia. AS-Exo were injected intravenously through the tail vein into ischemic mice at a concentration of 80 μg per 2 ml after 60 min of the ligation operation The results showed that AS-Exo enhanced neurons viability; inhibited OGD-induced apoptosis, inhibited OGD-induced expressions of caspase-3 and Bax and levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in HT-22 cells. Further findings showed AS-Exo inhibited OGD-induced neurons apoptosis via regulating autophagy. AS-Exo ameliorated neuronal damage through regulating autophagy in vivo. Our data indicate that AS-Exo suppress autophagy and ameliorate neuronal damage in experimental ischemic stroke.

Abstract: Persistent microbial infection promotes the fusion of several kinds of somatic cells, such as macrophages and endothelial cells, leading to the formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs). However, the molecular mechanisms of MGCs formation are still poorly understood. By laser confocal microscope, we discovered that TRIM34 increased the efficiency of cell fusion in Human Embryonic Kidney cells (HEK293T). By means of DiD cell membrane probes, LysoTracker Deep Red or MitoTracker Deep Red staining, we also demonstrated that TRIM34 stimulated cell fusion in paraformaldehyde fixed or living HEK293T cells. Moreover, we discovered that the nuclei shapes of MGCs induced by TRIM34 were diversiform, such as horseshoe shape, ring like shape etc. Through 3D reconstruction of confocal z-stacks images, we found that TRIM34-EGFP proteins could form macromolecule aggregates in the central area of MGCs, while the nuclei were arranged in ring like shape and distributed around the plasma membrane. Cell fusion assay showed that cocultured TRIM34-EGFP+ cells and TRIM34-DsRed1+ cells could fuse to form MGCs. We speculate that the formation of MGCs can be divided into two phase: primary multinucleated cells (PMCs) and secondary multinucleated cells (SMCs). Firstly, TRIM34 induced fusion of multiple adjacent cells resulting in PMCs formation, and then PMCs were endowed with the capacity of phagocytosis and turned into SMCs. Collectively, these results suggest that TRIM34 proteins contribute to the formation of MGCs by promoting cell fusion and phagocytosis in epithelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
ATP-driven bacterial AAA+ proteases have been recognized as drug targets. They possess an AAA+ protein (e.g., ClpC), which threads substrate proteins into an associated peptidase (e.g., ClpP). ATPase activity and substrate selection of AAA+ proteins are regulated by adapter proteins that bind to regulatory domains, such as the N-terminal domain (NTD). The antibacterial peptide Cyclomarin A (CymA) kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells by binding to the NTD of ClpC. How CymA affects ClpC function is unknown. Here, we reveal the mechanism of CymA-induced toxicity. We engineered a CymA-sensitized ClpC chimera and show that CymA activates ATPase and proteolytic activities. CymA mimics adapter binding and enables autonomous protein degradation by ClpC/ClpP with relaxed substrate selectivity. We reconstitute CymA toxicity in E. coli cells expressing engineered ClpC and ClpP, demonstrating that gain of uncontrolled proteolytic activity causes cell death. This validates drug-induced overriding of AAA+ protease activity control as effective antibacterial strategy.

Abstract: Summary
The proteolytic arm of the protein homeostasis network is maintained by both the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. A well-balanced crosstalk between the two catabolic pathways ensures energy-efficient maintenance of cellular function. Our current understanding of the crosstalk between the UPS and autophagy is centered around substrate ubiquitination. Herein we report an additional method of crosstalk involving ubiquitin-independent 20S proteasome regulation of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. We found that enhancement of 20S proteasome activity increased the degradation of the disordered soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor proteins, synaptosomal-associated protein 29 (SNAP29), and syntaxin 17 (STX17), but not vesicle-associated membrane protein 8. This resulted in a reduction of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, which was ameliorated upon overexpression of both SNAP29 and STX17. In all, we herein present a mechanism of crosstalk between the proteasome and autophagy pathway that is regulated by ubiquitin-independent 20S proteasome-mediated degradation of SNAP29 and STX17.

Abstract: Oxaliplatin has been widely applied in clinical tumor chemotherapy, the treatment failure of which mainly blames on low susceptibility resulted from intrinsic or acquired drug resistance in tumor cells. Microenvironmental hypoxia is one of the important pathological features of solid tumors, which is closely related to the radiochemotherapy tolerance and poor prognosis. Cinnamaldehyde is extracted from Cinnamomum cassia with inhibiting effect against kinds of tumors. In this study, we demonstrated that hypoxia reduced the sensitivity to oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells via inducing EMT and stemness. Nonetheless, cinnamaldehyde increased the curative effect of oxaliplatin by promoting apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, cinnamaldehyde and oxaliplatin synergistically reversed hypoxia-induced EMT and stemness of CRC cells and suppressed hypoxia-activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway synergistically. These consequences uncovered the potential therapeutic value of cinnamaldehyde and provided novel ideas on improving the sensitivity of oxaliplatin in CRC therapy.

Abstract: The in vitro expansion of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) is necessary for obtaining sufficient amounts of cells for clinical applications. However, EPC expansion is conventionally carried out under non-physiologic oxygen concentrations (normoxia, ~20% O2). We compared the effects of normoxic and hypoxic culture on the stemness of expanded EPCs. Human EPCs were cultured under hypoxia (1% O2) or normoxia (~20% O2), respectively. Cell proliferation, colony formation, in vitro angiogenesis, and the migration ability of the expanded EPCs were compared. To explore the underlying mechanism, whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was also performed to select differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were then partially validated by western blotting. EPCs cultured under normoxia showed reduced proliferation, colony formation, in vitro angiogenesis, and migration abilities and a higher proportion of senescent cells compared with those cultured under hypoxia. A total of 48 DEGs were identified by transcriptome RNA-seq. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that six pathways were enriched, among which the p53 signaling pathway. Finally, we confirmed the differential expression of the p53 pathway by Western blot analysis. Compared with hypoxia, normoxia is not favorable for maintaining the stemness of human EPCs. Several signaling pathways, including the p53 signaling pathway implicate in reducing stemness of EPCs under normoxia.

Abstract: Mast cells (MCs) are important effectors of the immediate allergic response. MCs are distributed throughout various tissues and organs, and adhere to extracellular matrix (ECM) with broad stiffness in the body. Here we compared cellular responses following antigen stimulation in MCs on glass-base dishes with and without a hydrogel. We found that an antigen-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was suppressed slightly in cells on hydrogel-coated dishes compared with those on non-coated dishes, whereas their subsequent degranulation was largely inhibited in cells adherent to the hydrogel. Focusing on focal adhesions (FAs), vinculin was distributed in a dot-like manner at the bottom of resting cells on non-coated dishes but not on hydrogel-coated dishes. According to antigen stimulation, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and additive vinculin accumulation to FAs were promoted in cells on non-coated dishes, but were diminished on hydrogel-coated dishes. Moreover, microtubule reorganization and acetylation (which have important roles in MC degranulation) were also suppressed in activated MCs adherent to the hydrogel. These findings suggest that adhesion to a hydrogel led to failure of composition of functional FAs and microtubule tracts, which resulted in suppression of MC degranulation following antigen stimulation.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide, and there is currently no effective therapeutic strategy in clinical practice. Gene therapy has great potential for decreasing tumor-induced mortality but has been clinically limited because of the lack of tumor-specific targets and insufficient gene transfer. The study of targeted transport of therapeutic genes in HCC treatment seems to be very important. In this study, we evaluated a gene therapy approach targeting HCC using the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSVtk/GCV) suicide gene system in HCC cell lines and in an in vivo human HCC xenograft mouse model. GP73-modified liposomes targeted gene delivery to the tumor tissue, and the survivin promoter drove HSVtk expression in the HCC cells. Our results showed that the survivin promoter was specifically activated in tumor cells and HSVtk was expressed selectively in tumor cells. Combined with GCV treatment, HSVtk expression resulted in suppression of HCC cell proliferation via enhancing apoptosis. Moreover, tail vein injection of GP73-HSVtk significantly suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors through an apoptosis-dependent pathway and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice without damaging the mice liver functions. Taken together, this study demonstrates an effective cancer-specific gene therapy strategy using the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSVtk/GCV) suicide gene system for HCC that can be further developed for future clinical trials.

Abstract: Objective
This article aims to investigate the mechanism of microRNA-495 (miR-495) and long non-coding RNA CRNDE on the apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs).
Methods
The mouse model of IBD was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), and human colonic epithelial cell lines (HT-29, LOVO, and Caco-2) were treated with DSS, and received cell transfection. RNA interference was used to down-regulate CRNDE expression.
Results
CRNDE and SOCS1 were highly expressed, but miR-495 was lowly expressed in the DSS-induced colitis tissues and colonic epithelial cell lines. Interference of CRNDE inhibited cell apoptosis of DSS-induced colonic epithelial cells. The interaction between CRNDE and miR-495 was confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assay. The target relationship between miR-495 and SOCS1 was confirmed by the luciferase reporter assay. CRNDE promoted DSS-induced colonic epithelial cell apoptosis via miR-495/SOCS1. CRNDE interference in DSS-induced colitis mouse model alleviated clinical manifestations of IBD.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrated that CRNDE promoted DSS-induced colonic epithelial cell apoptosis via suppressing miR-495 and increasing SOCS1, indicating CRNDE as a novel target of treating IBD.

Abstract: Osteoclast adhesion is important for bone resorption. Osteoprotegerin inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption via Ca2+ signaling. Purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) affects osteoclastogenesis by activating transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1). However, the detailed mechanism of osteoprotegerin-mediated P2X7R modulation of osteoclast adhesion is unclear. This study aimed to determine the effect of P2X7R on osteoprotegerin-induced damage to osteoclast adhesion. Osteoprotegerin reduced the expression of P2X7R, and protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) and SRC phosphorylation, and reduced calcium concentration, significantly decreasing Ca2+-NFATc1 signaling. 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM)/N-(6-Aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride (W-7) partly or absolutely recovered osteoprotegerin-induced osteoclasts adhesion structure damage, including increased the PYK2 and SRC phosphorylation, changed the distribution of PYK2/SRC and integrinαvβ3, and inhibited retraction of lamellipodia and filopodia and recovered osteoclast bone resorption activity. In addition, BAPTA-AM/W-7 also increased osteoprotegerin-induced activation of Ca2+-NFATc1 signaling, and restored normal P2X7R levels. P2X7R knockdown significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation, and the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, reduced the PYK2 and SRC phosphorylation, and inhibited Ca2+-related protein activation. However, P2X7R knockdown aggravated osteoprotegerin-induced osteoclast adhesion damage via Ca2+ signaling. In conclusion, the P2X7R–Ca2+ NFATc1 signaling pathway has a key functional role in osteoprotegerin-induced osteoclast adhesion structure damage.

Abstract: In situ regeneration of lacrimal gland (LG) tissue would be a promising approach to curatively treat dry eye disease (DED). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exhibit therapeutic effects in a variety of pathological conditions and our group recently reported that their number increases in regenerating mouse LG. Since the therapeutic effects are suggested to arise from secreted trophic factors, the application of MSC-secreted proteins seems to be a promising approach to induce/enhance LG regeneration. Therefore, this study aims to optimize the isolation of murine LG-MSC and analyze their secretome to investigate its potential for LG epithelial cell survival in vitro. For optimization, LG-MSC were isolated by an explant technique or cell sorting and their secretome was investigated under normal and inflammatory conditions. Results showed that the secretome of MSC had beneficial effects on the viability of ethanol-damaged LG epithelial cells. Additional, Lipocalin-2, prosaposin, ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (Rac1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), proteins that were up-regulated under inflammatory conditions, further improved the cell survival of ethanol-damaged LG epithelial cells. Interestingly, recovery of cell viability was highest, when the cells were incubated with STAT1. Summarizing, this study identified promising proteins for further studies on LG regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
For long QT syndrome (LQTS), recent progress in genome-sequencing technologies enabled the identification of rare genomic variants with diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. However, pathogenic stratification of the identified variants remains challenging, especially in variants of uncertain significance. This study aimed to propose a phenotypic cell-based diagnostic assay for identifying LQTS to recognize pathogenic variants in a high-throughput manner suitable for screening. We investigated the response of LQT2-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) following IKr blockade using a multi-electrode array, finding that the response to IKr blockade was significantly smaller than in Control-iPSC-CMs. Furthermore, we found that LQT1-iPSC-CMs and LQT3-iPSC-CMs could be distinguished from Control-iPSC-CMs by IKs blockade and INa blockade, respectively. This strategy might be helpful in compensating for the shortcomings of genetic testing of LQTS patients.

Abstract: Summary
In the adult subependymal zone (SEZ), neural stem cells (NSCs) apically contacting the lateral ventricle on activation generate progenitors proliferating at the niche basal side. We here show that Tailless (TLX) coordinates NSC activation and basal progenitor proliferation by repressing the NOTCH effector Hes1. Consistent with this, besides quiescence Hes1 expression also increases on Tlx mutation. Since HES1 levels are higher at the apical SEZ, NOTCH activation is increased in Tlx−/− NSCs, but not in surrounding basal progenitors. Underscoring the causative relationship between higher HES1/NOTCH and increased quiescence, downregulation of Hes1 only in mutant NSCs normalizes NOTCH activation and resumes proliferation and neurogenesis not only in NSCs, but especially in basal progenitors. Since pharmacological blockade of NOTCH signaling also promotes proliferation of basal progenitors, we conclude that TLX, by repressing Hes1 expression, counteracts quiescence and NOTCH activation in NSCs, thereby relieving NOTCH-mediated lateral inhibition of proliferation in basal progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the importance of understanding how variability across induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines due to non-genetic factors (clone and passage) influences their differentiation outcome, large-scale studies capable of addressing this question have not yet been conducted. Here, we differentiated 191 iPSC lines to generate iPSC-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells (iPSC-CVPCs). We observed cellular heterogeneity across the iPSC-CVPC samples due to varying fractions of two cell types: cardiomyocytes (CMs) and epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs). Comparing the transcriptomes of CM-fated and EPDC-fated iPSCs, we discovered that 91 signature genes and X chromosome dosage differences are associated with these two distinct cardiac developmental trajectories. In an independent set of 39 iPSCs differentiated into CMs, we confirmed that sex and transcriptional differences affect cardiac-fate outcome. Our study provides novel insights into how iPSC transcriptional and X chromosome gene dosage differences influence their response to differentiation stimuli and, hence, cardiac cell fate.
