Abstract: Summary
Maternal antibodies (MatAbs) protect offspring from infections but limit their responses to vaccination. The mechanisms of this inhibition are still debated. Using murine early-life immunization models mimicking the condition prevailing in humans, we observed the induction of CD4-T, T follicular helper, and germinal center (GC) B cell responses even when early-life antibody responses were abrogated by MatAbs. GC B cells induced in the presence of MatAbs form GC structures and exhibit canonical GC changes in gene expression but fail to differentiate into plasma cells and/or memory B cells in a MatAb titer-dependent manner. Furthermore, GC B cells elicited in the presence or absence of MatAbs use different VH and Vk genes and show differences in genes associated with B cell differentiation and isotype switching. Thus, MatAbs do not prevent B cell activation but control the output of the GC reaction both quantitatively and qualitatively, shaping the antigen-specific B cell repertoire.

Abstract: Summary
R-loops are three-stranded DNA:RNA hybrids that are implicated in many nuclear processes. While R-loops may have physiological roles, the formation of stable, aberrant R-loops has been observed in neurological disorders and cancers. Current methods to assess their genome-wide distribution rely on affinity purification, which is plagued by large input requirements, high noise, and poor sensitivity for dynamic R-loops. Here, we present MapR, a method that utilizes RNase H to guide micrococcal nuclease to R-loops, which are subsequently cleaved, released, and identified by sequencing. MapR detects R-loops formed at promoters and active enhancers that are likely to form transient R-loops due to the low transcriptional output of these regulatory elements and the short-lived nature of enhancer RNAs. MapR is as specific as existing techniques and more sensitive, allowing for genome-wide coverage with low input material in a fraction of the time.

Abstract: Summary
Noradrenaline (NE), the main neurotransmitter released by sympathetic nerve terminals, is known to modulate the immune response. However, the role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) on the development of autoimmune diseases is still unclear. Here, we report that the SNS limits the generation of pathogenic T cells and disease development in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis (MS). β2-Adrenergic receptor (Adrb2) signaling limits T cell autoimmunity in EAE through a mechanism mediated by the suppression of IL-2, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF production via inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER). Accordingly, the lack of Adrb2 signaling in immune cells is sufficient to abrogate the suppressive effects of SNS activity, resulting in increased pathogenic T cell responses and EAE development. Collectively, these results uncover a suppressive role for the SNS in CNS autoimmunity while they identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Activating mutations in Kras are nearly ubiquitous in human pancreatic cancer and initiate precancerous pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) when induced in mouse acinar cells. PanINs normally take months to form but are accelerated by deletion of acinar cell differentiation factors such as Ptf1a, suggesting that loss of cell identity is rate limiting for pancreatic tumor initiation. Using a genetic mouse model that allows for independent control of oncogenic Kras and Ptf1a expression, we demonstrate that sustained Ptf1a is sufficient to prevent Kras-driven tumorigenesis, even in the presence of tumor-promoting inflammation. Furthermore, reintroducing Ptf1a into established PanINs reverts them to quiescent acinar cells in vivo. Similarly, Ptf1a re-expression in human pancreatic cancer cells inhibits their growth and colony-forming ability. Our results suggest that reactivation of an endogenous differentiation program can prevent and reverse oncogene-driven transformation in cells harboring tumor-driving mutations, introducing a potential paradigm for solid tumor prevention and treatment.

Abstract: Summary
HDAC4, a class IIa histone deacetylase, is upregulated in skeletal muscle in response to denervation-induced atrophy. When HDAC4 is deleted postnatally, mice are partially protected from denervation. Despite the name “histone” deacetylase, HDAC4 demonstrably deacetylates cytosolic and non-histone nuclear proteins. We developed potent and selective class IIa HDAC inhibitors. Using these tools and genetic knockdown, we identified three previously unidentified substrates of HDAC4: myosin heavy chain, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1α), and heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hsc70). HDAC4 inhibition almost completely prevented denervation-induced loss of myosin heavy chain isoforms and blocked the action of their E3 ligase, MuRF1. PGC-1α directly interacts with class IIa HDACs; selective inhibitors increased PGC-1α protein in muscles. Hsc70 deacetylation by HDAC4 affects its chaperone activity. Through these endogenous HDAC4 substrates, we identified several muscle metabolic pathways that are regulated by class IIa HDACs, opening up new therapeutic options to treat skeletal muscle disorders and potentially other disease where these specific pathways are affected.

Abstract: Pancreatic islets produce pulses of insulin and other hormones that maintain normal glucose homeostasis. These micro-organs possess exquisite glucose-sensing capabilities, allowing for precise changes in pulsatile insulin secretion in response to small changes in glucose. When communication among these cells is disrupted, precision glucose sensing falters. We measured intracellular calcium patterns in 6-mM-steps between 0 and 16 mM glucose, and also more finely in 2-mM-steps from 8 to 12 mM glucose, to compare glucose sensing systematically among intact islets and dispersed islet cells derived from the same mouse pancreas in vitro. The calcium activity of intact islets was uniformly low (quiescent) below 4 mM glucose and active above 8 mM glucose, whereas dispersed beta-cells displayed a broader activation range (2-to-10 mM). Intact islets exhibited calcium oscillations with 2-to-5-min periods, yet beta-cells exhibited longer 7–10 min periods. In every case, intact islets showed changes in activity with each 6-mM-glucose step, whereas dispersed islet cells displayed a continuum of calcium responses ranging from islet-like patterns to stable oscillations unaffected by changes in glucose concentration. These differences were also observed for 2-mM-glucose steps. Despite the diversity of dispersed beta-cell responses to glucose, the sum of all activity produced a glucose dose-response curve that was surprisingly similar to the curve for intact islets, arguing against the importance of “hub cells” for function. Beta-cells thus retain many of the features of islets, but some are more islet-like than others. Determining the molecular underpinnings of these variations could be valuable for future studies of stem-cell-derived beta-cell therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) are the two major pathways of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and both are highly conserved from yeast to mammals. Nej1 has a role in DNA end-tethering at a DSB, and the Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX) complex is important for its recruitment to the break. Nej1 and Dna2-Sgs1 interact with the C-terminal end of Mre11, which also includes the region where Rad50 binds. By characterizing the functionality of Nej1 in two rad50 mutants, which alter the structural features of MRX, we demonstrate that Nej1 inhibits the binding of Dna2 to Mre11 and Sgs1. Nej1 interactions with Mre11 promote tethering and inhibit hyper-resection, and when these events are compromised, large deletions develop at a DSB. The work indicates that Nej1 provides a layer of regulation to repair pathway choice and is consistent with its role in NHEJ.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) regulate many cellular processes and can therefore serve as readouts of the signaling and regulatory state. Yet for many TFs, the mode of action—repressing or activating transcription of target genes—is unclear. Here, we present diffTF (https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/diffTF) to calculate differential TF activity (basic mode) and classify TFs into putative transcriptional activators or repressors (classification mode). In basic mode, it combines genome-wide chromatin accessibility/activity with putative TF binding sites that, in classification mode, are integrated with RNA-seq. We apply diffTF to compare (1) mutated and unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and (2) two hematopoietic progenitor cell types. In both datasets, diffTF recovers most known biology and finds many previously unreported TFs. It classifies almost 40% of TFs based on their mode of action, which we validate experimentally. Overall, we demonstrate that diffTF recovers known biology, identifies less well-characterized TFs, and classifies TFs into transcriptional activators or repressors.

Abstract: Summary
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is modulated by conditions of metabolic stress and has been reported to decline with aging in preclinical models, but human data are sparse. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation ameliorates metabolic dysfunction in rodents. We aimed to establish whether oral NR supplementation in aged participants can increase the skeletal muscle NAD+ metabolome and if it can alter muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics. We supplemented 12 aged men with 1 g NR per day for 21 days in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Targeted metabolomics showed that NR elevated the muscle NAD+ metabolome, evident by increased nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide clearance products. Muscle RNA sequencing revealed NR-mediated downregulation of energy metabolism and mitochondria pathways, without altering mitochondrial bioenergetics. NR also depressed levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines. Our data establish that oral NR is available to aged human muscle and identify anti-inflammatory effects of NR.

Abstract: Summary
There is a current imperative to unravel the hierarchy of molecular pathways that drive the transition of early to established disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Herein, we report a comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis of the molecular pathways that drive early RA progression in the disease tissue (synovium), comparing matched peripheral blood RNA-seq in a large cohort of early treatment-naive patients, namely, the Pathobiology of Early Arthritis Cohort (PEAC). We developed a data exploration website (https://peac.hpc.qmul.ac.uk/) to dissect gene signatures across synovial and blood compartments, integrated with deep phenotypic profiling. We identified transcriptional subgroups in synovium linked to three distinct pathotypes: fibroblastic pauci-immune pathotype, macrophage-rich diffuse-myeloid pathotype, and a lympho-myeloid pathotype characterized by infiltration of lymphocytes and myeloid cells. This is suggestive of divergent pathogenic pathways or activation disease states. Pro-myeloid inflammatory synovial gene signatures correlated with clinical response to initial drug therapy, whereas plasma cell genes identified a poor prognosis subgroup with progressive structural damage.

Abstract: Abnormal epithelial stratification is a sign of oral dysplasia and hence evaluation of surface characteristics of oral epithelial region can help in detection of cancerous progression. Surface characteristics can be better visualised by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in comparison to light microscopy. In our study we have developed automated image processing algorithms i.e. Gaussian with median filtering and Gradient filtering, using MATLAB 2016b, to segment the surface characteristics i.e. the ridges and pits in the SEM images of oral tissue of normal (13 samples) and Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSF) (36 samples) subjects. After segmentation, quantitative measurement of the parameters like area, thickness and textural features like entropy, contrast and range filter of ridges as well as area of pit and the ratio of area of ridge vs. area of pit was done. Statistical significant differences were obtained in between normal and OSF study groups for thickness (p=0.0107), entropy (p<0.00001) and contrast of ridge (p<0.00001) for Gaussian with median filtering and for all the parameters except thickness of the ridge(p=1.386), for Gradient filtering. Thus, computer aided image processing by Gradient filter followed by quantitative measurement of the surface characteristics provided precise differentiation between normal and precancerous oral condition.

Abstract: Summary
BDNF/TrkB neurotrophic signaling regulates neuronal development, differentiation, and survival, and deficient BDNF/TrkB activity underlies neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, exactly how BDNF/TrkB participates in AD pathology remains unclear. Here, we show that deprivation of BDNF/TrkB increases inflammatory cytokines and activates the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, resulting in the upregulation of transcription factor C/EBPβ. This, in turn, results in increased expression of δ-secretase, leading to both APP and Tau fragmentation by δ-secretase and neuronal loss, which can be blocked by expression of STAT3 Y705F, knockdown of C/EBPβ, or the δ-secretase enzymatic-dead C189S mutant. Inhibition of this pathological cascade can also rescue impaired synaptic plasticity and cognitive dysfunctions. Importantly, reduction in BDNF/TrkB neurotrophic signaling is inversely coupled with an increase in JAK2/STAT3, C/EBPβ, and δ-secretase escalation in human AD brains. Therefore, our findings provide a mechanistic link between BDNF/TrkB reduction, C/EBPβ upregulation, δ-secretase activity, and Aβ and Tau alterations in murine brains.

Abstract: Summary
Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells can be activated via either their T cell receptor (TCR), which recognizes MR1-bound pyrimidines derived from microbial riboflavin biosynthesis, or via cytokines. These two modes of activation may act in concert or independently, depending upon the stimulus. It is unknown, however, how MAIT cell responses differ with the mode of activation. Here, we define transcriptional and effector responses of human CD8+ MAIT cells to TCR and cytokine stimulation. We report that MAIT cells rapidly respond to TCR stimulation, producing multiple cytokines and chemokines, altering their cytotoxic granule content and transcription factor expression, and upregulating co-stimulatory proteins. In contrast, cytokine-mediated activation is slower and results in a more limited response. Therefore, we propose that, in infections by riboflavin-synthesizing bacteria, MAIT cells play a key early role in effecting and coordinating immune responses, while in the absence of TCR stimulation, their role is likely to differ.

Abstract: Summary
There is an unmet need for new antimitotic drug combinations that target cancer-specific vulnerabilities. Based on our finding of elevated biomolecule oxidation in mitotically arrested cancer cells, we combined Plk1 inhibitors with TH588, an MTH1 inhibitor that prevents detoxification of oxidized nucleotide triphosphates. This combination showed robust synergistic killing of cancer, but not normal, cells that, surprisingly, was MTH1-independent. To dissect the underlying synergistic mechanism, we developed VISAGE, a strategy integrating experimental synergy quantification with computational-pathway-based gene expression analysis. VISAGE predicted, and we experimentally confirmed, that this synergistic combination treatment targeted the mitotic spindle. Specifically, TH588 binding to β-tubulin impaired microtubule assembly, which when combined with Plk1 blockade, synergistically disrupted mitotic chromosome positioning to the spindle midzone. These findings identify a cancer-specific mitotic vulnerability that is targetable using Plk1 inhibitors with microtubule-destabilizing agents and highlight the general utility of the VISAGE approach to elucidate molecular mechanisms of drug synergy.

Abstract: Summary
Human genetic studies implicate interleukin-27 (IL-27) in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. To further define the role of IL-27 in T1D, we generated non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice deficient in IL-27 or IL-27Rα. In contrast to wild-type NOD mice, both NOD.Il27−/− and NOD.Il27ra−/− strains are completely resistant to T1D. IL-27 from myeloid cells and IL-27 signaling in T cells are critical for T1D development. IL-27 directly alters the balance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 1 (Th1) cells in pancreatic islets, which in turn modulates the diabetogenic activity of CD8 T cells. IL-27 also directly enhances the effector function of CD8 T cells within pancreatic islets. In addition to T1D, IL-27 signaling in T cells is also required for lacrimal and salivary gland inflammation in NOD mice. Our study reveals that IL-27 contributes to autoimmunity in NOD mice through multiple mechanisms and provides substantial evidence to support its pathogenic role in human T1D.

Abstract: Summary
RNA sequencing analyses are often limited to identifying lowest p value transcripts, which does not address polygenic phenomena. To overcome this limitation, we developed an integrative approach that combines large-scale transcriptomic meta-analysis of patient brain tissues with single-cell sequencing data of CNS neurons, short RNA sequencing of human male- and female-originating cell lines, and connectomics of transcription factor and microRNA interactions with perturbed transcripts. We used this pipeline to analyze cortical transcripts of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. Although these pathologies show massive transcriptional parallels, their clinically well-known sexual dimorphisms remain unexplained. Our method reveals the differences between afflicted men and women and identifies disease-affected pathways of cholinergic transmission and gp130-family neurokine controllers of immune function interlinked by microRNAs. This approach may open additional perspectives for seeking biomarkers and therapeutic targets in other transmitter systems and diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Major depression is a serious global health concern; however, the pathophysiology underlying this condition remains unclear. While numerous studies have focused on brain-specific mechanisms, few have evaluated the role of peripheral organs in depression. Here, we show that the liver activates an intrinsic metabolic pathway that can modulate depressive-like behavior. We find that chronic stress specifically increases the protein levels of monomeric and oligomeric soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), a key enzyme in epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) signaling, in the liver. Hepatic deletion of Ephx2 (which encodes sEH) results in antidepressant-like effects, while the hepatic overexpression of sEH induces depressive phenotypes. The activity of sEH in hepatocytes modulates the plasma levels of 14,15-EET, which then interacts with astrocytes in the medial prefrontal cortex to mediate the effects of hepatic Ephx2 deletion. These results suggest that targeting mechanisms underlying the hepatic response to stress would increase our therapeutic options for the treatment of depression.

Abstract: Summary
Lymphatic vascular development establishes embryonic and adult tissue fluid balance and is integral in disease. In diverse vertebrate organs, lymphatic vessels display organotypic function and develop in an organ-specific manner. In all settings, developmental lymphangiogenesis is considered driven by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-3 (VEGFR3), whereas a role for VEGFR2 remains to be fully explored. Here, we define the zebrafish Vegf/Vegfr code in receptor binding studies. We find that while Vegfd directs craniofacial lymphangiogenesis, it binds Kdr (a VEGFR2 homolog) but surprisingly, unlike in mammals, does not bind Flt4 (VEGFR3). Epistatic analyses and characterization of a kdr mutant confirm receptor-binding analyses, demonstrating that Kdr is indispensible for rostral craniofacial lymphangiogenesis, but not caudal trunk lymphangiogenesis, in which Flt4 is central. We further demonstrate an unexpected yet essential role for Kdr in inducing lymphatic endothelial cell fate. This work reveals evolutionary divergence in the Vegf/Vegfr code that uncovers spatially restricted mechanisms of developmental lymphangiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying cellular programs that drive cancers to be stem-like and treatment resistant is critical to improving outcomes in patients. Here, we demonstrate that constitutive extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation sustains a stem-like state in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 activation restores neurogenesis during murine astrocytoma formation, inducing neuronal differentiation in tumorspheres. Constitutive ERK1/2 activation globally regulates miRNA expression in murine and human GBMs, while neuronal differentiation of GBM tumorspheres following the inhibition of ERK1/2 activation requires the functional expression of miR-124 and the depletion of its target gene SOX9. Overexpression of miR124 depletes SOX9 in vivo and promotes a stem-like-to-neuronal transition, with reduced tumorigenicity and increased radiation sensitivity. Providing a rationale for reports demonstrating miR-124-induced abrogation of GBM aggressiveness, we conclude that reversal of an ERK1/2-miR-124-SOX9 axis induces a neuronal phenotype and that enforcing neuronal differentiation represents a therapeutic strategy to improve outcomes in GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Proteasomes are essential in all eukaryotic cells. However, their function and regulation remain considerably elusive, particularly those of less abundant variants. We demonstrate the human 20S proteasome recombinant assembly and confirmed the recombinant complex integrity biochemically and with a 2.6 Å resolution cryo-EM map. To assess its competence to form higher-order assemblies, we prepared and analyzed recombinant human 20S-PA200, a poorly characterized nuclear complex. Its 3.0 Å resolution cryo-EM structure reveals the PA200 unique architecture; the details of its intricate interactions with the proteasome, resulting in unparalleled proteasome α ring rearrangements; and the molecular basis for PA200 allosteric modulation of the proteasome active sites. Non-protein cryo-EM densities could be assigned to PA200-bound inositol phosphates, and we speculate regarding their functional role. Here we open extensive opportunities to study the fundamental properties of the diverse and distinct eukaryotic proteasome variants and to improve proteasome targeting under different therapeutic conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) display great diversity in cisplatin sensitivity that cannot be explained solely by cancer-associated DNA repair defects. Differential activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) to cisplatin has been proposed to underlie the observed differential sensitivity, but it has not been investigated systematically. Systems-level analysis—using quantitative time-resolved signaling data and phenotypic responses, in combination with mathematical modeling—identifies that the activation status of cell-cycle checkpoints determines cisplatin sensitivity in TNBC cell lines. Specifically, inactivation of the cell-cycle checkpoint regulator MK2 or G3BP2 sensitizes cisplatin-resistant TNBC cell lines to cisplatin. Dynamic signaling data of five cell cycle-related signals predicts cisplatin sensitivity of TNBC cell lines. We provide a time-resolved map of cisplatin-induced signaling that uncovers determinants of chemo-sensitivity, underscores the impact of cell-cycle checkpoints on cisplatin sensitivity, and offers starting points to optimize treatment efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Age-associated decay of intercellular interactions impairs the cells’ capacity to tightly associate within tissues and form a functional barrier. This barrier dysfunction compromises organ physiology and contributes to systemic failure. The actin cytoskeleton represents a key determinant in maintaining tissue architecture. Yet, it is unclear how age disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and how this, in turn, promotes mortality. Here, we show that an uncharacterized phosphorylation of a low-abundant actin variant, ACT-5, compromises integrity of the C. elegans intestinal barrier and accelerates pathogenesis. Age-related loss of the heat-shock transcription factor, HSF-1, disrupts the JUN kinase and protein phosphatase I equilibrium which increases ACT-5 phosphorylation within its troponin binding site. Phosphorylated ACT-5 accelerates decay of the intestinal subapical terminal web and impairs its interactions with cell junctions. This compromises barrier integrity, promotes pathogenesis, and drives mortality. Thus, we provide the molecular mechanism by which age-associated loss of specialized actin networks impacts tissue integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle cell (myofiber) atrophy is a detrimental component of aging and cancer that primarily results from muscle protein degradation via the proteasome and ubiquitin ligases. Transcriptional upregulation of some ubiquitin ligases contributes to myofiber atrophy, but little is known about the role that most other ubiquitin ligases play in this process. To address this question, we have used RNAi screening in Drosophila to identify the function of > 320 evolutionarily conserved ubiquitin ligases in myofiber size regulation in vivo. We find that whereas RNAi for some ubiquitin ligases induces myofiber atrophy, loss of others (including the N-end rule ubiquitin ligase UBR4) promotes hypertrophy. In Drosophila and mouse myofibers, loss of UBR4 induces hypertrophy via decreased ubiquitination and degradation of a core set of target proteins, including the HAT1/RBBP4/RBBP7 histone-binding complex. Together, this study defines the repertoire of ubiquitin ligases that regulate myofiber size and the role of UBR4 in myofiber hypertrophy.

Abstract: Summary
We hypothesized that bone evolved, in part, to enhance the ability of bony vertebrates to escape danger in the wild. In support of this notion, we show here that a bone-derived signal is necessary to develop an acute stress response (ASR). Indeed, exposure to various types of stressors in mice, rats (rodents), and humans leads to a rapid and selective surge of circulating bioactive osteocalcin because stressors favor the uptake by osteoblasts of glutamate, which prevents inactivation of osteocalcin prior to its secretion. Osteocalcin permits manifestations of the ASR to unfold by signaling in post-synaptic parasympathetic neurons to inhibit their activity, thereby leaving the sympathetic tone unopposed. Like wild-type animals, adrenalectomized rodents and adrenal-insufficient patients can develop an ASR, and genetic studies suggest that this is due to their high circulating osteocalcin levels. We propose that osteocalcin defines a bony-vertebrate-specific endocrine mediation of the ASR.

Abstract: Summary
Pacemaker cardiomyocytes that create the sinoatrial node are essential for the initiation and maintenance of proper heart rhythm. However, illuminating developmental cues that direct their differentiation has remained particularly challenging due to the unclear cellular origins of these specialized cardiomyocytes. By discovering the origins of pacemaker cardiomyocytes, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved Wnt signaling mechanism that coordinates gene regulatory changes directing mesoderm cell fate decisions, which lead to the differentiation of pacemaker cardiomyocytes. We show that in zebrafish, pacemaker cardiomyocytes derive from a subset of Nkx2.5+ mesoderm that responds to canonical Wnt5b signaling to initiate the cardiac pacemaker program, including activation of pacemaker cell differentiation transcription factors Isl1 and Tbx18 and silencing of Nkx2.5. Moreover, applying these developmental findings to human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) notably results in the creation of hPSC-pacemaker cardiomyocytes, which successfully pace three-dimensional bioprinted hPSC-cardiomyocytes, thus providing potential strategies for biological cardiac pacemaker therapy.

Abstract: Summary
MYOD-directed fibroblast trans-differentiation into skeletal muscle provides a unique model to investigate how one transcription factor (TF) reconfigures the three-dimensional chromatin architecture to control gene expression, which is otherwise achieved by the combinatorial activities of multiple TFs. Integrative analysis of genome-wide high-resolution chromatin interactions, MYOD and CTCF DNA-binding profile, and gene expression, revealed that MYOD directs extensive re-wiring of interactions involving cis-regulatory and structural genomic elements, including promoters, enhancers, and insulated neighborhoods (INs). Re-configured INs were hot-spots of differential interactions, whereby MYOD binding to highly constrained sequences at IN boundaries and/or inside INs led to alterations of promoter-enhancer interactions to repress cell-of-origin genes and to activate muscle-specific genes. Functional evidence shows that MYOD-directed re-configuration of chromatin interactions temporally preceded the effect on gene expression and was mediated by direct MYOD-DNA binding. These data illustrate a model whereby a single TF alters multi-loop hubs to drive somatic cell trans-differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Although antibiotics disturb the structure of the gut microbiota, factors that modulate these perturbations are poorly understood. Bacterial metabolism is an important regulator of susceptibility in vitro and likely plays a large role within the host. We applied a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach to link antibiotic-induced taxonomic and transcriptional responses within the murine microbiome. We found that antibiotics significantly alter the expression of key metabolic pathways at the whole-community and single-species levels. Notably, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which blooms in response to amoxicillin, upregulated polysaccharide utilization. In vitro, we found that the sensitivity of this bacterium to amoxicillin was elevated by glucose and reduced by polysaccharides. Accordingly, we observed that dietary composition affected the abundance and expansion of B. thetaiotaomicron, as well as the extent of microbiome disruption with amoxicillin. Our work indicates that the metabolic environment of the microbiome plays a role in the response of this community to antibiotics.

Abstract: Summary
To break down organismal fitness into molecular contributions, costs and benefits of cellular components must be analyzed in all phases of the organism’s life cycle. Here, we establish the required quantitative approach for the death phase of the model bacterium Escherichia coli. We show that in carbon starvation, an exponential decay of viability emerges as a collective phenomenon, with viable cells recycling nutrients from cell carcasses to maintain viability. The observed collective death rate is determined by the maintenance rate of viable cells and the amount of nutrients recovered from dead cells. Using this relation, we study the cost of a wasteful enzyme during starvation and the benefit of the stress response sigma factor RpoS. While the enzyme increases maintenance and thereby the death rate, RpoS improves biomass recycling, decreasing the death rate. Our approach thus enables quantitative analyses of how cellular components affect the survival of non-growing cells.

Abstract: As an obligate biotroph, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh) cannot be grown in an axenic culture, and instead must be cultivated on its host species, Hordeum vulgare (barley). In this study an in vitro system utilizing n-hexacosanal, a constituent of the barley cuticle and known inducer of Bgh germination, was used to cultivate Bgh and differentiate conidia up to the appressorial germ tube stage for analysis. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of the appressorial germ tube stage revealed that there was a significant shift towards energy and protein production during the pre-penetrative phase of development, with an up-regulation of enzymes associated with cellular respiration and protein synthesis, modification and transport. Glycosidic linkage analysis of the cell wall polysaccharides demonstrated that during appressorial development an increase in 1,3- and 1,4-linked glucosyl residues and xylosyl residues was detected along with a significant decrease in galactosyl residues. The use of this in vitro cultivation method demonstrates that it is possible to analyse the pre-penetrative processes of Bgh development in the absence of a plant host.

Abstract: Summary
BCR-ABL1 point mutation-mediated resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia is effectively managed with several approved drugs, including ponatinib for BCR-ABL1T315I-mutant disease. However, therapy options are limited for patients with leukemic clones bearing multiple BCR-ABL1 mutations. Asciminib, an allosteric inhibitor targeting the myristoyl-binding pocket of BCR-ABL1, is active against most single mutants but ineffective against all tested compound mutants. We demonstrate that combining asciminib with ATP site TKIs enhances target inhibition and suppression of resistant outgrowth in Ph+ clinical isolates and cell lines. Inclusion of asciminib restores ponatinib's effectiveness against currently untreatable compound mutants at clinically achievable concentrations. Our findings support combining asciminib with ponatinib as a treatment strategy for this molecularly defined group of patients.

Abstract: Summary
Reactivation of T cell immunity by PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade has been shown to be a promising cancer therapeutic strategy. However, PD-L1 immunohistochemical readout is inconsistent with patient response, which presents a clinical challenge to stratify patients. Because PD-L1 is heavily glycosylated, we developed a method to resolve this by removing the glycan moieties from cell surface antigens via enzymatic digestion, a process termed sample deglycosylation. Notably, deglycosylation significantly improves anti-PD-L1 antibody binding affinity and signal intensity, resulting in more accurate PD-L1 quantification and prediction of clinical outcome. This proposed method of PD-L1 antigen retrieval may provide a practical and timely approach to reduce false-negative patient stratification for guiding anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteriophages provide excellent tools for diagnostics, remediation, and targeted microbiome manipulation, yet isolating viruses with suitable host specificity remains challenging. Using Listeria phage PSA, we present a synthetic biology blueprint for host-range engineering through targeted modification of serovar-specific receptor binding proteins (RBPs). We identify Gp15 as the PSA RBP and construct a synthetic phage library featuring sequence-randomized RBPs, from which host range mutants are isolated and subsequently integrated into a synthetic, polyvalent phage with extended host range. To enable rational design of chimeric RBPs, we determine the crystal structure of the Gp15 receptor-binding carboxyl terminus at 1.7-Å resolution and employ bioinformatics to identify compatible, prophage-encoded RBPs targeting different Listeria serovars. Structure-guided design enables exchange of heterologous RBP head, neck, or shoulder domains to generate chimeric phages with predictable and extended host ranges. These strategies will facilitate the development of phage biologics based on standardized virus scaffolds with tunable host specificities.

Abstract: Summary
Dopamine (DA) activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) via protein kinase A (PKA)/Rap1 in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), thereby regulating reward-related behavior. However, how MAPK regulates reward-related learning and memory through gene expression is poorly understood. Here, to identify the relevant transcriptional factors, we perform proteomic analysis using affinity beads coated with cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), a transcriptional coactivator involved in reward-related behavior. We identify more than 400 CBP-interacting proteins, including Neuronal Per Arnt Sim domain protein 4 (Npas4). We find that MAPK phosphorylates Npas4 downstream of PKA, increasing the Npas4-CBP interaction and the transcriptional activity of Npas4 at the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promoter. The deletion of Npas4 in D1R-expressing MSNs impairs cocaine-induced place preference, which is rescued by Npas4-wild-type (WT), but not by a phospho-deficient Npas4 mutant. These observations suggest that MAPK phosphorylates Npas4 in D1R-MSNs and increases transcriptional activity to enhance reward-related learning and memory.

Binding of guide RNA fastens the subdomains, thereby rearranging the active-site residues and increasing the affinity for TNRC6 proteins. We also identified two water pockets beneath the nucleic acid-binding channel that appeared to stabilize the mature RISC. Indeed, mutating the water-pocket residues of Argonaute2 and Argonaute4 compromised RISC assembly. Simulations predict that internal water molecules are exchangeable with the bulk solvent but always occupy specific positions at the domain interfaces. These results suggest that after guide RNA-driven conformational changes, water-mediated hydrogen-bonding networks tie together the converged domains to complete the functional RISC structure.

Abstract: Summary
Break-induced replication (BIR) is a pathway of homology-directed repair that repairs one-ended DNA breaks, such as those formed at broken replication forks or uncapped telomeres. In contrast to conventional S phase DNA synthesis, BIR proceeds by a migrating D-loop and results in conservative synthesis of the nascent strands. DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ) initiates BIR; however, it is not known whether synthesis of the invading strand switches to a different polymerase or how the complementary strand is synthesized. By using alleles of the replicative DNA polymerases that are permissive for ribonucleotide incorporation, thus generating a signature of their action in the genome that can be identified by hydrolytic end sequencing, we show that Pol δ replicates both the invading and the complementary strand during BIR. In support of this conclusion, we show that depletion of Pol δ from cells reduces BIR, whereas depletion of Pol ε has no effect.

Abstract: Summary
CEP104 is an evolutionarily conserved centrosomal and ciliary tip protein. CEP104 loss-of-function mutations are reported in patients with Joubert syndrome, but their function in the etiology of ciliopathies is poorly understood. Here, we show that cep104 silencing in zebrafish causes cilia-related manifestations: shortened cilia in Kupffer’s vesicle, heart laterality, and cranial nerve development defects. We show that another Joubert syndrome-associated cilia tip protein, CSPP1, interacts with CEP104 at microtubules for the regulation of axoneme length. We demonstrate in human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized retinal pigmented epithelium (hTERT-RPE1) cells that ciliary translocation of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog pathway stimulation is both CEP104 and CSPP1 dependent. However, CEP104 is not required for the ciliary recruitment of CSPP1, indicating that an intra-ciliary CEP104-CSPP1 complex controls axoneme length and Hedgehog signaling competence. Our in vivo and in vitro analyses of CEP104 define its interaction with CSPP1 as a requirement for the formation of Hedgehog signaling-competent cilia, defects that underlie Joubert syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
The impact of mammalian RNA interference components, particularly, Argonaute proteins, on chromatin organization is unexplored. Recent reports indicate that AGO1 association with chromatin appears to influence gene expression. To uncover the role of AGO1 in the nucleus, we used a combination of genome-wide approaches in control and AGO1-depleted HepG2 cells. We found that AGO1 strongly associates with active enhancers and RNA being produced at those sites. Hi-C analysis revealed AGO1 enrichment at the boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs). By Hi-C in AGO1 knockdown cells, we observed changes in chromatin organization, including TADs and A/B compartment mixing, specifically in AGO1-bound regions. Distinct groups of genes and especially eRNA transcripts located within differentially interacting loci showed altered expression upon AGO1 depletion. Moreover, AGO1 association with enhancers is dependent on eRNA transcription. Collectively, our data suggest that enhancer-associated AGO1 contributes to the fine-tuning of chromatin architecture and gene expression in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Purinergic receptors and nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) proteins have been shown to control viral infection. Here, we show that the NLR family member NLRP3 and the purinergic receptor P2Y2 constitutively interact and regulate susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. We found that NLRP3 acts as an inhibitory factor of viral entry that represses F-actin remodeling. The binding of the HIV-1 envelope to its host cell receptors (CD4, CXCR4, and/or CCR5) overcomes this restriction by stimulating P2Y2. Once activated, P2Y2 enhances its interaction with NLRP3 and stimulates the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL to NLRP3, ultimately leading to NLRP3 degradation. NLRP3 degradation is permissive for PYK2 phosphorylation (PYK2Y402∗) and subsequent F-actin polymerization, which is required for the entry of HIV-1 into host cells. Taken together, our results uncover a mechanism by which HIV-1 overcomes NLRP3 restriction that appears essential for the accomplishment of the early steps of HIV-1 entry.

Abstract: Summary
The rapid proliferation of cancer cells and dysregulated vasculature within the tumor leads to limited nutrient accessibility. Cancer cells often rewire their metabolic pathways for adaption to nutrient stress, and the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) is a key enzyme in glutaminolysis that converts glutamate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Here, we show that, under low glucose, GDH1 is phosphorylated at serine (S) 384 and interacts with RelA and IKKβ. GDH1-produced α-KG directly binds to and activates IKKβ and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling, which promotes glucose uptake and tumor cell survival by upregulating GLUT1, thereby accelerating gliomagenesis. In addition, GDH1 S384 phosphorylation correlates with the malignancy and prognosis of human glioblastoma. Our finding reveals a unique role of α-KG to directly regulate signal pathway, uncovers a distinct mechanism of metabolite-mediated NF-κB activation, and also establishes the critical role of α-KG-activated NF-κB in brain tumor development.

Abstract: Summary
RNA localization in eukaryotes is a mechanism to regulate transcripts fate. Conversely, bacterial transcripts were not assumed to be specifically localized. We previously demonstrated that E. coli mRNAs may localize to where their products localize in a translation-independent manner, thus challenging the transcription-translation coupling extent. However, the scope of RNA localization in bacteria remained unknown. Here, we report the distribution of the E. coli transcriptome between the membrane, cytoplasm, and poles by combining cell fractionation with deep-sequencing (Rloc-seq). Our results reveal asymmetric RNA distribution on a transcriptome-wide scale, significantly correlating with proteome localization and prevalence of translation-independent RNA localization. The poles are enriched with stress-related mRNAs and small RNAs, the latter becoming further enriched upon stress in an Hfq-dependent manner. Genome organization may play a role in localizing membrane protein-encoding transcripts. Our results show an unexpected level of intricacy in bacterial transcriptome organization and highlight the poles as hubs for regulation.

Abstract: Summary
There are limited data on fetal and early life development of human intestinal immunity. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and next-generation sequencing of B and T cell receptor (BCR and TCR) repertoires, we demonstrate complex intestinal immunity from 16 weeks’ gestational age (GA). Both BCR and TCR repertoires are diverse with CDRH and CDR3β length increasing with advancing GA. The difference-from-germline, CDR insertions and/or deletions, similarly occur in utero for TCR but not BCR, suggesting earlier mucosal T than B cell maturity. Innate immunity is dominated by macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and natural killer (NK) cells. Follicular and transitional B cells are enriched in fetuses while CD69+IgM+ B cells are abundant in infants. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are abundant, capable of secreting cytokines and are phenotypically of the tissue resident memory state in utero. Our data provide the foundation for a 2nd trimester and infant intestinal immune atlas and suggest that a complex innate and adaptive immune landscape exists significantly earlier than previously reported.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic chromosomes contain compartments of various functions, which are marked by and enriched with specific histone modifications. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these histone marks function in chromosome compartmentalization are poorly understood. Constitutive heterochromatin is a largely silent chromosome compartment characterized in part by H3K9me2 and 3. Here, we show that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), an H3K9me2 and 3 “reader,” interacts with SUV39H1, an H3K9me2 and 3 “writer,” and with TRIM28, an abundant HP1 scaffolding protein, to form complexes with increased multivalent engagement of H3K9me2 and 3-modified chromatin. H3K9me2 and 3-marked nucleosomal arrays and associated complexes undergo phase separation to form macromolecule-enriched liquid droplets. The droplets are reminiscent of heterochromatin as they are highly dense chromatin-containing structures that are resistant to DNase and exclude the general transcription factor TFIIB. Our data suggest a general mechanism by which histone marks regulate chromosome compartmentalization by promoting phase separation.

Abstract: Altered genetic features in cancer cells lead to a high rate of aerobic glycolysis and metabolic reprogramming that is essential for increased cancer cell viability and rapid proliferation. Pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the final step of glycolysis. Herein, we report that PKM is a potential therapeutic target in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We found that PKM1 or PKM2 is highly expressed in TNBC tissues or cells. Knockdown of PKM significantly suppressed cell proliferation and migration, and strongly reduced S phase and induced G2 phase cell cycle arrest by reducing phosphorylation of the CDC2 protein in TNBC cells. Additionally, knockdown of PKM significantly suppressed NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity by reducing the phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536, and also decreased the expression of NF-κB target genes. Taken together, PKM is a potential target that may have therapeutic implications for TNBC cells.

Abstract: Summary
To ensure a successful infection, herpesviruses have developed elegant strategies to counterbalance the host anti-viral responses. Sterile alpha motif and HD domain 1 (SAMHD1) was recently identified as an intrinsic restriction factor for a variety of viruses. Aside from HIV-2 and the related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Vpx proteins, the direct viral countermeasures against SAMHD1 restriction remain unknown. Using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as a primary model, we discover that SAMHD1-mediated anti-viral restriction is antagonized by EBV BGLF4, a member of the conserved viral protein kinases encoded by all herpesviruses. Mechanistically, we find that BGLF4 phosphorylates SAMHD1 and thereby inhibits its deoxynucleotide triphosphate triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) activity. We further demonstrate that the targeting of SAMHD1 for phosphorylation is a common feature shared by beta- and gamma-herpesviruses. Together, our findings uncover an immune evasion mechanism whereby herpesviruses exploit the phosphorylation of SAMHD1 to thwart host defenses.

Abstract: Summary
Some viruses are released from cells as pools of membrane-associated virions. By increasing the multiplicity of infection (MOI), this type of collective dispersal could favor viral cooperation, but also the emergence of cheater-like viruses such as defective interfering particles. To better understand this process, we examined the genetic diversity of membrane-associated coxsackievirus infectious units. We find that infected cells release membranous structures (including vesicles) that contain 8–21 infectious particles on average. However, in most cases (62%–93%), these structures do not promote the co-transmission of different viral genetic variants present in a cell. Furthermore, collective dispersal has no effect on viral population sequence diversity. Our results indicate that membrane-associated collective infectious units typically contain viral particles derived from the same parental genome. Hence, if cooperation occurs, it should probably involve sibling viral particles rather than different variants. As shown by social evolution theory, cooperation among siblings should be robust against cheater invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Chondrolectin (Chodl) is needed for motor axon extension in zebrafish and is dysregulated in mouse models of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, the mechanistic basis of Chodl function is not known. Here, we use Chodl-deficient zebrafish and mouse mutants to show that the absence of Chodl leads to anatomical and functional defects of the neuromuscular synapse. In zebrafish, the growth of an identified motor axon beyond an “en passant” synapse and later axon branching from synaptic points are impaired, leading to functional deficits. Mechanistically, motor-neuron-autonomous Chodl function depends on its intracellular domain and on binding muscle-derived collagen XIXa1 by its extracellular C-type lectin domain. Our data support evolutionarily conserved roles of Chodl in synaptogenesis and provide evidence for a “synapse-first” scenario of motor axon growth in zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic organisms accomplish the removal of introns to produce mature mRNAs through splicing. Nuclear and organelle splicing mechanisms are distinctively executed by spliceosome and group II intron complex, respectively. Here, we show that LEFKOTHEA, a nuclear encoded RNA-binding protein, participates in chloroplast group II intron and nuclear pre-mRNA splicing. Transiently optimized LEFKOTHEA nuclear activity is fundamental for plant growth, whereas the loss of function abruptly arrests embryogenesis. Nucleocytoplasmic partitioning and chloroplast allocation are efficiently balanced via functional motifs in LEFKOTHEA polypeptide. In the context of nuclear-chloroplast coevolution, our results provide a strong paradigm of the convergence of RNA maturation mechanisms in the nucleus and chloroplasts to coordinately regulate gene expression and effectively control plant growth.

Abstract: Summary
The basic leucine zipper transcription factor activating transcription factor-like (Batf) contributes to transcriptional programming of multiple effector T cells and is required for T helper 17 (Th17) and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell development. Here, we examine mechanisms by which Batf initiates gene transcription in developing effector CD4 T cells. We find that, in addition to its pioneering function, Batf controls developmentally regulated recruitment of the architectural factor Ctcf to promote chromatin looping that is associated with lineage-specific gene transcription. The chromatin-organizing actions of Batf are largely dependent on Ets1, which appears to be indispensable for the Batf-dependent recruitment of Ctcf. Moreover, most of the Batf-dependent sites to which Ctcf is recruited lie outside of activating protein-1-interferon regulatory factor (Ap-1-Irf) composite elements (AICEs), indicating that direct involvement of Batf-Irf complexes is not required. These results identify a cooperative role for Batf, Ets1, and Ctcf in chromatin reorganization that underpins the transcriptional programming of effector T cells.

Abstract: Infection of barley with the powdery mildew causal agent, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh), can lead to devastating damage to barley crops. The recent emergence of fungicide resistance imposes a need to develop new antifungal strategies. The enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis are ideal targets for the development of fungicides. However, in order to narrow down any target proteins involved in cell wall formation, a greater understanding of the cell wall structure and composition is required. Here, we present a detailed carbohydrate analysis of the Bgh conidial cell wall, a full annotation of Carbohydrate Active enZymes (CAZy) in the Bgh genome, and a comprehensive expression profile of the genes involved in cell wall metabolism. Glycosidic linkage analysis has revealed that the cell wall polysaccharide fraction of Bgh conidia predominantly consists of glucosyl residues (63.1%) and has a greater proportion of galactopyranosyl residues compared to other species (8.5%). Trace amounts of xylosyl residues were also detected, which is unusual in ascomycetes. Transcripts of the genes involved in cell wall metabolism show high expression of chitin deacetylases, which assist fungi in evading the host defence system by deacetylating chitin to chitosan. The data presented suggest that the cell wall components of the conidia and the corresponding obligate biotrophic CAZy gene profile play a key role in the infection process.

Abstract: Summary
Bacillus spp. produce a wide range of secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, which have been well studied for their antibacterial properties but less so as signaling molecules. Previous results indicated that the lipopeptide bacillomycin D is a signal that promotes biofilm development of Bacillus velezensis SQR9. However, the mechanism behind this signaling is still unknown. Here, we show that bacillomycin D promotes biofilm development by promoting the acquisition of iron. Bacillomycin D promotes the transcription of the iron ABC transporter FeuABC by binding to its transcription factor, Btr. These actions increase intracellular iron concentration and activate the KinB-Spo0A-SinI-SinR-dependent synthesis of biofilm matrix components. We demonstrate that this strategy is beneficial for biofilm development and competition with the Pseudomonas fluorescens PF-5. Our results unravel an antibiotic-dependent signaling mechanism that links iron acquisition to biofilm development and ecological competition.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo signaling pathway plays a key role in development and cancer progression. However, molecules that intrinsically inhibit this pathway are less well known. Here, we report that the focal adhesion molecule Kindlin-2 inhibits Hippo signaling by interacting with and degrading MOB1 and promoting the interaction between MOB1 and the E3 ligase praja2. Kindlin-2 thus inhibits the phosphorylation of LATS1 and YAP and promotes YAP translocation into the nucleus, where it activates downstream Hippo target gene transcription. Kindlin-2 depletion activates Hippo/YAP signaling and alleviates renal fibrosis in Kindlin-2 knockout mice with unilateral ureteral occlusion (UUO). Moreover, Kindlin-2 levels are negatively correlated with MOB1 and phosphorylated (p) YAP in samples from patients with renal fibrosis. Altogether, these results demonstrate that Kindlin-2 inhibits Hippo signaling through degradation of MOB1.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute proteins loaded with microRNAs (miRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which represses target RNA expression. Predicting the biological targets, specificity, and efficiency of both miRNAs and siRNAs has been hamstrung by an incomplete understanding of the sequence determinants of RISC binding and cleavage. We applied high-throughput methods to measure the association kinetics, equilibrium binding energies, and single-turnover cleavage rates of mouse AGO2 RISC. We find that RISC readily tolerates insertions of up to 7 nt in its target opposite the central region of the guide. Our data uncover specific guide:target mismatches that enhance the rate of target cleavage, suggesting novel siRNA design strategies. Using these data, we derive quantitative models for RISC binding and target cleavage and show that our in vitro measurements and models predict knockdown in an engineered cellular system.

Abstract: Summary
Similar to ubiquitin, SUMO forms chains, but the identity of SUMO-chain-modified factors and the purpose of this modification remain largely unknown. Here, we identify the budding yeast SUMO protease Ulp2, able to disassemble SUMO chains, as a DDK interactor enriched at replication origins that promotes DNA replication initiation. Replication-engaged DDK is SUMOylated on chromatin, becoming a degradation-prone substrate when Ulp2 no longer protects it against SUMO chain assembly. Specifically, SUMO chains channel DDK for SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase Slx5/Slx8-mediated and Cdc48 segregase-assisted proteasomal degradation. Importantly, the SUMOylation-defective ddk-KR mutant rescues inefficient replication onset and MCM activation in cells lacking Ulp2, suggesting that SUMO chains time DDK degradation. Using two unbiased proteomic approaches, we further identify subunits of the MCM helicase and other factors as SUMO-chain-modified degradation-prone substrates of Ulp2 and Slx5/Slx8. We thus propose SUMO-chain/Ulp2-protease-regulated proteasomal degradation as a mechanism that times the availability of functionally engaged SUMO-modified protein pools during replication and beyond.

Abstract: Summary
Cells escape the need for mitogens at a restriction point several hours before entering S phase. The restriction point has been proposed to result from CDK4/6 initiating partial Rb phosphorylation to trigger a bistable switch whereby cyclin E-CDK2 and Rb mutually reinforce each other to induce Rb hyperphosphorylation. Here, using single-cell analysis, we unexpectedly found that cyclin E/A-CDK activity can only maintain Rb hyperphosphorylation starting at the onset of S phase and that CDK4/6 activity, but not cyclin E/A-CDK activity, is required to hyperphosphorylate Rb throughout G1 phase. Mitogen removal in G1 results in a gradual loss of CDK4/6 activity with a high likelihood of cells sustaining Rb hyperphosphorylation until S phase, at which point cyclin E/A-CDK activity takes over. Thus, it is short-term memory, or transient hysteresis, in CDK4/6 activity following mitogen removal that sustains Rb hyperphosphorylation, demonstrating a probabilistic rather than an irreversible molecular mechanism underlying the restriction point.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp104 is an AAA+ protein disaggregase, which can be potentiated via diverse mutations in its autoregulatory middle domain (MD) to mitigate toxic misfolding of TDP-43, FUS, and α-synuclein implicated in fatal neurodegenerative disorders. Problematically, potentiated MD variants can exhibit off-target toxicity. Here, we mine disaggregase sequence space to safely enhance Hsp104 activity via single mutations in nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1) or NBD2. Like MD variants, NBD variants counter TDP-43, FUS, and α-synuclein toxicity and exhibit elevated ATPase and disaggregase activity. Unlike MD variants, non-toxic NBD1 and NBD2 variants emerge that rescue TDP-43, FUS, and α-synuclein toxicity. Potentiating substitutions alter NBD1 residues that contact ATP, ATP-binding residues, or the MD. Mutating the NBD2 protomer interface can also safely ameliorate Hsp104. Thus, we disambiguate allosteric regulation of Hsp104 by several tunable structural contacts, which can be engineered to spawn enhanced therapeutic disaggregases with minimal off-target toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
As a Ca2+-activated lipid scramblase and ion channel that mediates Ca2+ influx, TMEM16F relies on both functions to facilitate extracellular vesicle generation, blood coagulation, and bone formation. How a bona fide ion channel scrambles lipids remains elusive. Our structural analyses revealed the coexistence of an intact channel pore and PIP2-dependent protein conformation changes leading to membrane distortion. Correlated to the extent of membrane distortion, many tightly bound lipids are slanted. Structure-based mutagenesis studies further reveal that neutralization of some lipid-binding residues or those near membrane distortion specifically alters the onset of lipid scrambling, but not Ca2+ influx, thus identifying features outside of channel pore that are important for lipid scrambling. Together, our studies demonstrate that membrane distortion does not require open hydrophilic grooves facing the membrane interior and provide further evidence to suggest separate pathways for lipid scrambling and ion permeation.

Abstract: Summary
Notwithstanding the positive clinical impact of endocrine therapies in estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα)-positive breast cancer, de novo and acquired resistance limits the therapeutic lifespan of existing drugs. Taking the position that resistance is nearly inevitable, we undertook a study to identify and exploit targetable vulnerabilities that were manifest in endocrine therapy-resistant disease. Using cellular and mouse models of endocrine therapy-sensitive and endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer, together with contemporary discovery platforms, we identified a targetable pathway that is composed of the transcription factors FOXA1 and GRHL2, a coregulated target gene, the membrane receptor LYPD3, and the LYPD3 ligand, AGR2. Inhibition of the activity of this pathway using blocking antibodies directed against LYPD3 or AGR2 inhibits the growth of endocrine therapy-resistant tumors in mice, providing the rationale for near-term clinical development of humanized antibodies directed against these proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of both the DNA damage response (DDR) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling induces growth arrest of most cell types. However, it is unclear whether the DDR activates TGF-β signaling that in turn contributes to cell growth arrest. Here, we show that in response to DNA damage, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) stabilizes the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) and thus enhancement of TGF-β signaling. Mechanistically, ATM phosphorylates and stabilizes c-Cbl, which promotes TβRII neddylation and prevents its ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Consistently, DNA damage enhances the interaction among ATM, c-Cbl, and TβRII. The ATM-c-Cbl-TβRII axis plays a pivotal role in intestinal regeneration after X-ray-induced DNA damage in mouse models. Therefore, ATM not only mediates the canonical DDR pathway but also activates TGF-β signaling by stabilizing TβRII. The double brake system ensures full cell-cycle arrest, allowing efficient DNA damage repair and avoiding passage of the damaged genome to the daughter cells.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroepithelial stem cells (NSC) from different anatomical regions of the embryonic neural tube’s rostrocaudal axis can differentiate into diverse central nervous system tissues, but the transcriptional regulatory networks governing these processes are incompletely understood. Here, we measure region-specific NSC gene expression along the rostrocaudal axis in a human pluripotent stem cell model of early central nervous system development over a 72-h time course, spanning the hindbrain to cervical spinal cord. We introduce Escarole, a probabilistic clustering algorithm for non-stationary time series, and combine it with prior-based regulatory network inference to identify genes that are regulated dynamically and predict their upstream regulators. We identify known regulators of patterning and neural development, including the HOX genes, and predict a direct regulatory connection between the transcription factor POU3F2 and target gene STMN2. We demonstrate that POU3F2 is required for expression of STMN2, suggesting that this regulatory connection is important for region specificity of NSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Coordinate control of T cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation are essential for host protection from pathogens and cancer. Long-lived memory cells, whose precursors are formed during the initial immunological insult, provide protection from future encounters, and their generation is the goal of many vaccination strategies. microRNAs (miRNAs) are key nodes in regulatory networks that shape effective T cell responses through the fine-tuning of thousands of genes. Here, using compound conditional mutant mice to eliminate miR-15/16 family miRNAs in T cells, we show that miR-15/16 restrict T cell cycle, survival, and memory T cell differentiation. High throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation of AGO2 combined with gene expression analysis in miR-15/16-deficient T cells indicates that these effects are mediated through the direct inhibition of an extensive network of target genes within pathways critical to cell cycle, survival, and memory.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic RAS mutations drive cancers at many sites. Recent reports suggest that RAS dimerization, multimerization, and clustering correlate strongly with activation of RAS signaling. We have found that re-expression of DIRAS3, a RAS-related small GTPase tumor suppressor that is downregulated in multiple cancers, inhibits RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by interacting directly with RAS-forming heteromers, disrupting RAS clustering, inhibiting Raf kinase activation, and inhibiting transformation and growth of cancer cells and xenografts. Disruption of K-RAS cluster formation requires the N terminus of DIRAS3 and interaction of both DIRAS3 and K-RAS with the plasma membrane. Interaction of DIRAS3 with both K-RAS and H-RAS suggests a strategy for inhibiting oncogenic RAS function.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is composed of EED, SUZ12, and EZH1/2 and mediates mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. At least two independent subcomplexes exist, defined by their specific accessory proteins: PRC2.1 (PCL1–3, EPOP, and PALI1/2) and PRC2.2 (AEBP2 and JARID2). We show that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 share the majority of target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells. The loss of PCL1–3 is sufficient to evict PRC2.1 from Polycomb target genes but only leads to a partial reduction of PRC2.2 and H3K27me3. Conversely, disruption of PRC2.2 function through the loss of either JARID2 or RING1A/B is insufficient to completely disrupt targeting of SUZ12 by PCLs. Instead, the combined loss of both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 is required, leading to the global mislocalization of SUZ12. This supports a model in which the specific accessory proteins within PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 cooperate to direct H3K27me3 via both synergistic and independent mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The human ether-a-go-go-related gene KCNH2 encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel underlying IKr, a current critical for the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. Mutations in KCNH2 that cause a reduction of the repolarizing current can result in cardiac arrhythmias associated with long-QT syndrome. Here, we investigate the regulation of KCNH2 and identify multiple active enhancers. A transcribed enhancer ∼85 kbp downstream of Kcnh2 physically contacts the promoters of two Kcnh2 isoforms in a cardiac-specific manner in vivo. Knockdown of its ncRNA transcript results in reduced expression of Kcnh2b and two neighboring mRNAs, Nos3 and Abcb8, in vitro. Genomic deletion of the enhancer, including the ncRNA transcription start site, from the mouse genome causes a modest downregulation of both Kcnh2a and Kcnh2b in the ventricles. These findings establish that the regulation of Kcnh2a and Kcnh2b is governed by a complex regulatory landscape that involves multiple partially redundantly acting enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
We investigated the contribution of human platelets to macrophage effector properties in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as the beneficial effects and time frame for platelet transfusion in septic animals. Our results show that platelets sequester both pro-(TNF-α/IL-6) and anti-(IL-10) inflammatory cytokines released by monocytes. Low LPS concentrations (0.01 ng/mL) induced M2 macrophage polarization by decreasing CD64 and augmenting CD206 and CD163 expression; yet, the presence of platelets skewed monocytes toward type 1 macrophage (M1) phenotype in a cell-contact-dependent manner by the glycoprotein Ib (GPIb)-CD11b axis. Accordingly, platelet-licensed macrophages showed increased TNF-α levels, bacterial phagocytic activity, and a reduced healing capability. Platelet transfusion increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)+ macrophages, improving bacterial clearance and survival rates in septic mice up to 6 h post-infection, an effect that was abolished by CD11b and GPIb blockade. Our results demonstrate that platelets orchestrate macrophage effector responses, improving the clinical outcome of sepsis in a narrow but relevant time frame.

Abstract: Summary
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with metabolic and redox perturbation. The mitochondrial transporter uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) controls cell proliferation in vitro through the modulation of cellular metabolism, but the underlying mechanism in tumors in vivo remains unexplored. Using murine intestinal cancer models and CRC patient samples, we find higher UCP2 protein levels in tumors compared to their non-tumoral counterparts. We reveal the tumor-suppressive role of UCP2 as its deletion enhances colon and small intestinal tumorigenesis in AOM/DSS-treated and ApcMin/+ mice, respectively, and correlates with poor survival in the latter model. Mechanistically, UCP2 loss increases levels of oxidized glutathione and proteins in tumors. UCP2 deficiency alters glycolytic pathways while promoting phospholipid synthesis, thereby limiting the availability of NADPH for buffering oxidative stress. We show that UCP2 loss renders colon cells more prone to malignant transformation through metabolic reprogramming and perturbation of redox homeostasis and could favor worse outcomes in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate classification of breast tumors is vital for patient management decisions and enables more precise cancer treatment. Here, we present a quantitative proteotyping approach based on sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) mass spectrometry and establish key proteins for breast tumor classification. The study is based on 96 tissue samples representing five conventional breast cancer subtypes. SWATH proteotype patterns largely recapitulate these subtypes; however, they also reveal varying heterogeneity within the conventional subtypes, with triple negative tumors being the most heterogeneous. Proteins that contribute most strongly to the proteotype-based classification include INPP4B, CDK1, and ERBB2 and are associated with estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor grade status, and HER2 status. Although these three key proteins exhibit high levels of correlation with transcript levels (R > 0.67), general correlation did not exceed R = 0.29, indicating the value of protein-level measurements of disease-regulated genes. Overall, this study highlights how cancer tissue proteotyping can lead to more accurate patient stratification.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian erythropoiesis yields a highly specialized cell type, the mature erythrocyte, evolved to meet the organismal needs of increased oxygen-carrying capacity. To better understand the regulation of erythropoiesis, we performed genome-wide studies of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and transcriptomics using a recently developed strategy to obtain highly purified populations of primary human erythroid cells. The integration of gene expression, DNA methylation, and chromatin state dynamics reveals that stage-specific gene regulation during erythropoiesis is a stepwise and hierarchical process involving many cis-regulatory elements. Erythroid-specific, nonpromoter sites of chromatin accessibility are linked to erythroid cell phenotypic variation and inherited disease. Comparative analyses of stage-specific chromatin accessibility indicate that there is limited early chromatin priming of erythroid genes during hematopoiesis. The epigenome of terminally differentiating erythroid cells defines a distinct subset of highly specialized cells that are vastly dissimilar from other hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types. These epigenomic and transcriptome data are powerful tools to study human erythropoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition poses a threat to genome integrity, and cells have evolved mechanisms to restrict retrotransposition. However, how cellular proteins facilitate L1 retrotransposition requires elucidation. Here, we demonstrate that single-strand DNA breaks induced by the L1 endonuclease trigger the recruitment of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2 (PARP2) to L1 integration sites and that PARP2 activation leads to the subsequent recruitment of the replication protein A (RPA) complex to facilitate retrotransposition. We further demonstrate that RPA directly binds activated PARP2 through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and can protect single-strand L1 integration intermediates from APOBEC3-mediated cytidine deamination in vitro. Paradoxically, we provide evidence that RPA can guide APOBEC3A, and perhaps other APOBEC3 proteins, to sites of L1 integration. Thus, the interplay of L1-encoded and evolutionarily conserved cellular proteins is required for efficient retrotransposition; however, these interactions also may be exploited to restrict L1 retrotransposition in the human genome.

Abstract: Summary
Alcohol produces both stimulant and sedative effects in humans and rodents. In humans, alcohol abuse disorder is associated with a higher stimulant and lower sedative responses to alcohol. Here, we show that this association is conserved in mice and demonstrate a causal link with another liability factor: low expression of striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs). Using transgenic mouse lines, we find that the selective loss of D2Rs on striatal medium spiny neurons enhances sensitivity to ethanol stimulation and generates resilience to ethanol sedation. These mice also display higher preference and escalation of ethanol drinking, which continues despite adverse outcomes. We find that striatal D1R activation is required for ethanol stimulation and that this signaling is enhanced in mice with low striatal D2Rs. These data demonstrate a link between two vulnerability factors for alcohol abuse and offer evidence for a mechanism in which low striatal D2Rs trigger D1R hypersensitivity, ultimately leading to compulsive-like drinking.

Abstract: When endoplasmic reticulum (ER) functions are perturbed, the ER induces several signaling pathways called unfolded protein response to reestablish ER homeostasis through three ER transmembrane proteins: inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Although it is important to measure the activity of ATF6 that can indicate the status of the ER, no specific cell-based reporter assay is currently available. Here, we report a new cell-based method for monitoring ER stress based on the cleavage of ATF6α by sequential actions of proteases at the Golgi apparatus during ER stress. A new expressing vector was constructed by using fusion gene of GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4DBD) and activation domain derived from herpes simplex virus VP16 protein (VP16AD) followed by a human ATF6α N-terminal deletion variant. During ER stress, the GAL4DBD-VP16AD(GV)-hATF6α deletion variant was cleaved to liberate active transcription activator encompassing GV-hATF6α fragment which could translocate into the nucleus. The translocated GV-hATF6α fragment strongly induced the expression of firefly luciferase in HeLa Luciferase Reporter cell line containing a stably integrated 5X GAL4 site-luciferase gene. The established double stable reporter cell line HLR-GV-hATF6α(333) represents an innovative tool to investigate regulated intramembrane proteolysis of ATF6α. It can substitute active pATF6(N) binding motif-based reporter cell lines.

Abstract: Summary
Complex architectural rearrangements are associated to the control of the HoxD genes in different cell types; yet, how they are implemented in single cells remains unknown. By use of polymer models, we dissect the locus 3D structure at the single DNA molecule level in mouse embryonic stem and cortical neuronal cells, as the HoxD cluster changes from a poised to a silent state. Our model describes published Hi-C, 3-way 4C, and FISH data with high accuracy and is validated against independent 4C data on the Nsi-SB 0.5-Mb duplication and on triple contacts. It reveals the mode of action of compartmentalization on the regulation of the HoxD genes that have gene- and cell-type-specific multi-way interactions with their regulatory elements and high cell-to-cell variability. It shows that TADs and higher-order 3D structures, such as metaTADs, associate with distinct combinations of epigenetic factors, including but not limited to CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and histone marks.

Msp1 Clears Mistargeted Proteins by Facilitating Their Transfer from Mitochondria to the ER,

Abstract: Summary
Normal mitochondrial functions rely on optimized composition of their resident proteins, and proteins mistargeted to mitochondria need to be efficiently removed. Msp1, an AAA-ATPase in the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM), facilitates degradation of tail-anchored (TA) proteins mistargeted to the OM, yet how Msp1 cooperates with other factors to conduct this process was unclear. Here, we show that Msp1 recognizes substrate TA proteins and facilitates their transfer to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Doa10 in the ER membrane then ubiquitinates them with Ubc6 and Ubc7. Ubiquitinated substrates are extracted from the ER membrane by another AAA-ATPase in the cytosol, Cdc48, with Ufd1 and Npl4 for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol. Thus, Msp1 functions as an extractase that mediates clearance of mistargeted TA proteins by facilitating their transfer to the ER for protein quality control.

Abstract: Summary
PP1 and PP2A-B56 are major serine/threonine phosphatase families that achieve specificity by colocalizing with substrates. At the kinetochore, however, both phosphatases localize to an almost identical molecular space and yet they still manage to regulate unique pathways and processes. By switching or modulating the positions of PP1/PP2A-B56 at kinetochores, we show that their unique downstream effects are not due to either the identity of the phosphatase or its precise location. Instead, these phosphatases signal differently because their kinetochore recruitment can be either inhibited (PP1) or enhanced (PP2A) by phosphorylation inputs. Mathematical modeling explains how these inverse phospho-dependencies elicit unique forms of cross-regulation and feedback, which allows otherwise indistinguishable phosphatases to produce distinct network behaviors and control different mitotic processes. Furthermore, our genome-wide analysis suggests that these major phosphatase families may have evolved to respond to phosphorylation inputs in opposite ways because many other PP1 and PP2A-B56-binding motifs are also phospho-regulated.

Augmenter of Liver Regeneration Alleviates Renal Hypoxia-Reoxygenation Injury by Regulating Mitochondrial Dynamics in Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells,

Abstract: Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that constantly undergo fission and fusion processes that closely related to their function. Disruption of mitochondrial dynamics has been demonstrated in acute kidney injury (AKI), which could eventually result in cell injury and death. Previously, we reported that augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) alleviates renal tubular epithelial cell injury. Here, we gained further insights into whether the renoprotective roles of ALR are associated with mitochondrial dynamics. Changes in mitochondrial dynamics were examined in experimental models of renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR). In a model of hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) injury in vitro, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and mitochondrial fission process protein 1 (MTFP1), two key proteins of mitochondrial fission, were downregulated in the Lv-ALR + HR group. ALR overexpression additionally had an impact on phosphorylation of Drp1 Ser637 during AKI. The inner membrane fusion protein, Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1), was significantly increased whereas levels of outer membrane fusion proteins Mitofusin-1 and -2 (Mfn1, Mfn2) were not affected in the Lv-ALR + HR group, compared with the control group. Furthermore, the mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway was highly activated in the Lv-ALR + HR group. ALR overexpression led to suppression of HR-induced apoptosis. Our collective findings indicate that ALR gene transfection alleviates mitochondrial injury, possibly through inhibiting fission and promoting fusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane, both of which contribute to reduction of HK-2 cell apoptosis. Additionally, fission processes are potentially mediated by promoting tubular cell survival through activating the mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6, is associated with activities of several enzymes and the treatment of various neurological disorders. Here, we investigated the effects of pyridoxine on the immunoreactivity and protein levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-synthesizing and degradation enzymes such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), GABA transaminase (GABA-T), and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), in the hippocampus of mice. The mice intraperitonially received physiological saline and 350 mg/kg pyridoxine, twice a day for 21 days, and were euthanized 2 h after the final dose. In the vehicle-treated group, we observed GAD67 immunoreactivity in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 and CA3 region, Schaffer collateral, polymorphic layer, and outer granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Pyridoxine administration significantly increased GAD67 immunoreactivity, while significantly decreasing GABA-T immunoreactivity in pyridoxine-treated mouse hippocampi (CA1 region and dentate gyrus). In the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1 region, GABA-T immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the pyridoxine-treated group compared to that in the vehicle-treated group, although GAD67 immunoreactivity was similarly observed in these groups. Alternatively, there were no significant differences in SSADH immunoreactivity in any regions of the hippocampus between the vehicle- and pyridoxine-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed significant increases in GAD67 and GABA-T protein levels in the pyridoxine-treated group compared with those in the vehicle-treated group. Therefore, pyridoxine administration facilitates GABA turnover in mouse hippocampus by modulating the GABA-synthesizing and degradation enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
Quantifying cytostatic and cytotoxic outcomes are integral components of characterizing perturbagens used as research tools and in drug discovery pipelines. Furthermore, data-rich acquisition, coupled with robust methods for analysis, is required to properly assess the function and impact of these perturbagens. Here, we present a detailed and versatile method for single-cell and population-level analyses using real-time kinetic labeling (SPARKL). SPARKL integrates high-content live-cell imaging with automated detection and analysis of fluorescent reporters of cell death. We outline several examples of zero-handling, non-disruptive protocols for detailing cell death mechanisms and proliferation profiles. Additionally, we suggest several methods for mathematically analyzing these data to best utilize the collected kinetic data. Compared to traditional methods of detection and analysis, SPARKL is more sensitive, accurate, and high throughput while substantially eliminating sample processing and providing richer data.

Abstract: Summary
Remodeling of cell-cell junctions drives cell intercalation that causes tissue movement during morphogenesis through the shortening and growth of bicellular junctions. The growth of new junctions is essential for continuing and then completing cellular dynamics and tissue shape sculpting; however, the mechanism underlying junction growth remains obscure. We investigated Drosophila genitalia rotation where continuous cell intercalation occurs to show that myosin II accumulating at the vertices of a new junction is required for the junction growth. This myosin II accumulation requires the adhesive transmembrane protein Sidekick (Sdk), which localizes to the adherens junctions (AJs) of tricellular contacts (tAJs). Sdk also localizes to and blocks the accumulation of E-Cadherin at newly formed growing junctions, which maintains the growth rate. We propose that Sdk facilitates tAJ movement by mediating myosin II-driven contraction and altering the adhesive properties at the tAJs, leading to cell-cell junction extension during persistent junction remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
During evolution, organisms have acquired variable feeding habits. Some species are nutritional generalists that adapt to various food resources, while others are specialists, feeding on specific resources. However, much remains to be discovered about how generalists adapt to diversified diets. We find that larvae of the generalists Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans develop on three diets with different nutrient balances, whereas specialists D. sechellia and D. elegans cannot develop on carbohydrate-rich diets. The generalist D. melanogaster downregulates the expression of diverse metabolic genes systemically by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Activin signaling, maintains metabolic homeostasis, and successfully adapts to the diets. In contrast, the specialist D. sechellia expresses those metabolic genes at higher levels and accumulates various metabolites on the carbohydrate-rich diet, culminating in reduced adaptation. Phenotypic similarities and differences strongly suggest that the robust carbohydrate-responsive regulatory systems are evolutionarily retained through genome-environment interactions in the generalists and contribute to their nutritional adaptabilities.

Abstract: Summary
The importance of hypothalamic leptin and insulin resistance in the development and maintenance of obesity remains unclear. The tyrosine phosphatases protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) attenuate leptin and insulin signaling and are elevated in the hypothalami of obese mice. We report that elevated PTP1B and TCPTP antagonize hypothalamic leptin and insulin signaling and contribute to the maintenance of obesity. Deletion of PTP1B and TCPTP in the hypothalami of obese mice enhances CNS leptin and insulin sensitivity, represses feeding, and increases browning, to decrease adiposity and improve glucose metabolism. The daily intranasal administration of a PTP1B inhibitor, plus the glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 that decreases TCPTP expression, represses feeding, increases browning, promotes weight loss, and improves glucose metabolism in obese mice. Our findings causally link heightened hypothalamic PTP1B and TCPTP with leptin and insulin resistance and the maintenance of obesity and define a viable pharmacological approach by which to promote weight loss in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying proteins that function at replication forks is essential to understanding DNA replication, chromatin assembly, and replication-coupled DNA repair mechanisms. Combining quantitative mass spectrometry in multiple cell types with stringent statistical cutoffs, we generated a high-confidence catalog of 593 proteins that are enriched at replication forks and nascent chromatin. Loss-of-function genetic analyses indicate that 85% yield phenotypes that are consistent with activities in DNA and chromatin replication or already have described functions in these processes. We illustrate the value of this resource by identifying activities of the BET family proteins BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 in controlling DNA replication. These proteins use their extra-terminal domains to bind and inhibit the ATAD5 complex and thereby control the amount of PCNA on chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
Movement is an essential behavior requiring the assembly and refinement of spinal motor circuits. However, the mechanisms responsible for circuit refinement and synapse maintenance are poorly understood. Similarly, the molecular mechanisms by which gene mutations cause dysfunction and elimination of synapses in neurodegenerative diseases that occur during development are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the complement protein C1q is required for the refinement of sensory-motor circuits during normal development, as well as for synaptic dysfunction and elimination in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). C1q tags vulnerable SMA synapses, which triggers activation of the classical complement pathway leading to microglia-mediated elimination. Pharmacological inhibition of C1q or depletion of microglia rescues the number and function of synapses, conferring significant behavioral benefit in SMA mice. Thus, the classical complement pathway plays critical roles in the refinement of developing motor circuits, while its aberrant activation contributes to motor neuron disease.

Abstract: Summary
A key knowledge gap blocking development of effective therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the lack of understanding of how amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide and pathological forms of the tau protein cooperate in causing disease phenotypes. Within a mouse tau-deficient background, we probed the molecular, cellular, and behavioral disruption triggered by the influence of wild-type human tau on human Aβ-induced pathology. We find that Aβ and tau work cooperatively to cause a hyperactivity behavioral phenotype and to cause downregulation of transcription of genes involved in synaptic function. In both our mouse model and human postmortem tissue, we observe accumulation of pathological tau in synapses, supporting the potential importance of synaptic tau. Importantly, tau reduction in the mice initiated after behavioral deficits emerge corrects behavioral deficits, reduces synaptic tau levels, and substantially reverses transcriptional perturbations, suggesting that lowering synaptic tau levels may be beneficial in AD.

Abstract: Summary
Cell replacement is currently being explored as a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative disease. Using stem cells as a source, transplantable progenitors can now be generated under conditions compliant with clinical application in patients. In this study, we elucidate factors controlling target-appropriate innervation and circuitry integration of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived grafts after transplantation to the adult brain. We show that cell-intrinsic factors determine graft-derived axonal innervation, whereas synaptic inputs from host neurons primarily reflect the graft location. Furthermore, we provide evidence that hESC-derived dopaminergic grafts transplanted in a long-term preclinical rat model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) receive synaptic input from subtypes of host cortical, striatal, and pallidal neurons that are known to regulate the function of endogenous nigral dopamine neurons. This refined understanding of how graft neurons integrate with host circuitry will be important for the design of clinical stem-cell-based replacement therapies for PD, as well as for other neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Early B cell development is regulated by stage-specific transcription factors. PU.1, an ETS-family transcription factor, is essential for coordination of early B cell maturation and immunoglobulin gene (Ig) rearrangement. Here we show that RAG DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated during Ig light chain gene (Igl) rearrangement in pre-B cells induce global changes in PU.1 chromatin binding. RAG DSBs activate a SPIC/BCLAF1 transcription factor complex that displaces PU.1 throughout the genome and regulates broad transcriptional changes. SPIC recruits BCLAF1 to gene-regulatory elements that control expression of key B cell developmental genes. The SPIC/BCLAF1 complex suppresses expression of the SYK tyrosine kinase and enforces the transition from large to small pre-B cells. These studies reveal that RAG DSBs direct genome-wide changes in ETS transcription factor activity to promote early B cell development.

Abstract: Summary
Despite biomarker stratification, the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab is only effective against a subgroup of colorectal cancers (CRCs). This genomic and transcriptomic analysis of the cetuximab resistance landscape in 35 RAS wild-type CRCs identified associations of NF1 and non-canonical RAS/RAF aberrations with primary resistance and validated transcriptomic CRC subtypes as non-genetic predictors of benefit. Sixty-four percent of biopsies with acquired resistance harbored no genetic resistance drivers. Most of these had switched from a cetuximab-sensitive transcriptomic subtype at baseline to a fibroblast- and growth factor-rich subtype at progression. Fibroblast-supernatant conferred cetuximab resistance in vitro, confirming a major role for non-genetic resistance through stromal remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
The axon initial segment (AIS) is a compartment that serves as a molecular barrier to achieve axon-dendrite differentiation. Distribution of specific proteins during early neuronal development has been proposed to be critical for AIS construction. However, it remains unknown how these proteins are specifically targeted to the proximal axon within this limited time period. Here, we reveal spatiotemporal regulation driven by the microtubule (MT)-based motor KIF3A/B/KAP3 that transports TRIM46, influenced by a specific MARK2 phosphorylation cascade. In the proximal part of the future axon under low MARK2 activity, the KIF3/KAP3 motor recognizes TRIM46 as cargo and transports it to the future AIS. In contrast, in the somatodendritic area under high MARK2 activity, KAP3 phosphorylated at serine 60 by MARK2 cannot bind with TRIM46 and be transported. This spatiotemporal regulation between KIF3/KAP3 and TRIM46 under specific MARK2 activity underlies the specific transport needed for axonal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Genes are transcribed in a discontinuous pattern referred to as RNA bursting, but the mechanisms regulating this process are unclear. Although many physiological signals, including glucocorticoid hormones, are pulsatile, the effects of transient stimulation on bursting are unknown. Here we characterize RNA synthesis from single-copy glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated transcription sites (TSs) under pulsed (ultradian) and constant hormone stimulation. In contrast to constant stimulation, pulsed stimulation induces restricted bursting centered around the hormonal pulse. Moreover, we demonstrate that transcription factor (TF) nuclear mobility determines burst duration, whereas its bound fraction determines burst frequency. Using 3D tracking of TSs, we directly correlate TF binding and RNA synthesis at a specific promoter. Finally, we uncover a striking co-bursting pattern between TSs located at proximal and distal positions in the nucleus. Together, our data reveal a dynamic interplay between TF mobility and RNA bursting that is responsive to stimuli strength, type, modality, and duration.

Abstract: Summary
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical for regulating HOX genes, aberration of which is a dominant mechanism for leukemic transformation. How HOX gene-associated lncRNAs regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and contribute to leukemogenesis remains elusive. We found that HOTTIP is aberrantly activated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to alter HOXA-driven topologically associated domain (TAD) and gene expression. HOTTIP loss attenuates leukemogenesis of transplanted mice, while reactivation of HOTTIP restores leukemic TADs, transcription, and leukemogenesis in the CTCF-boundary-attenuated AML cells. Hottip aberration in mice abnormally promotes HSC self-renewal leading to AML-like disease by altering the homeotic/hematopoietic gene-associated chromatin signature and transcription program. Hottip aberration acts as an oncogenic event to perturb HSC function by reprogramming leukemic-associated chromatin and gene transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Facultative heterochromatin forms and reorganizes in response to external stimuli. However, how the initial establishment of such a chromatin state is regulated in cell-cycle-arrested cells remains unexplored. Mouse gonocytes are arrested male germ cells, at which stage the genome-wide DNA methylome forms. Here, we discovered transiently accessible heterochromatin domains of several megabases in size in gonocytes and named them differentially accessible domains (DADs). Open DADs formed in gene desert and gene cluster regions, primarily at transposons, with the reprogramming of histone marks, suggesting DADs as facultative heterochromatin. De novo DNA methylation took place with two waves in gonocytes: the first region specific and the second genome-wide. DADs were resistant to the first wave and their opening preceded the second wave. In addition, the higher-order chromosome architecture was reorganized with less defined chromosome compartments in gonocytes. These findings suggest that multiple layers of chromatin reprogramming facilitate de novo DNA methylation.

Abstract: Summary
Exon junction complex (EJC) assembles after splicing at specific positions upstream of exon-exon junctions in mRNAs of all higher eukaryotes, affecting major regulatory events. In mammalian cell cytoplasm, EJC is essential for efficient RNA surveillance, while in Drosophila, EJC is essential for localization of oskar mRNA. Here we developed a method for isolation of protein complexes and associated RNA targets (ipaRt) to explore the EJC RNA-binding landscape in a transcriptome-wide manner in adult Drosophila. We find the EJC at canonical positions, preferably on mRNAs from genes comprising multiple splice sites and long introns. Moreover, EJC occupancy is highest at junctions adjacent to strong splice sites, CG-rich hexamers, and RNA structures. Highly occupied mRNAs tend to be maternally localized and derive from genes involved in differentiation or development. These modalities, which have not been reported in mammals, specify EJC assembly on a biologically coherent set of transcripts in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity-induced adipose dysfunction is a major contributor to atherosclerosis. Cold exposure has been reported to affect atherosclerosis through regulation of adipose function, but the mechanism has not been well clarified. Here, adipocyte hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) was upregulated after mild cold exposure at 16°C and mediated cold-induced thermogenesis. Adipocyte HIF-2α deficiency exacerbated Western-diet-induced atherosclerosis by increasing adipose ceramide levels, which blunted hepatocyte cholesterol elimination and thermogenesis. Mechanistically, Acer2, the gene encoding alkaline ceramidase 2, was identified as a novel target gene of HIF-2α, triggering ceramide catabolism. Adipose overexpression of ACER2 rescued adipocyte HIF-2α-deficiency-induced exacerbation of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, activation of adipose HIF-2α by the HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor FG-4592 had protective effects on atherosclerosis, accompanied by a reduction in adipose and plasma ceramide and plasma cholesterol levels. This study highlights adipocyte HIF-2α as a putative drug target against atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Abstarct
Background and aim
Improvement of gut microbiota may help in preventing the progression of cirrhosis. We supposed that Lactobacillus Plantarum (L. Plantarum) protects the cirrhotic liver through suppression of TLR4/ CXCL9/ PREX-2.
Methodology
Rats were divided into two groups. Group I, lasts for six weeks and Group II lasts for 12 weeks. Each group was subdivided into: naïve, Lactobacillus Plantarum (L. Plantarum), thioacetamide (TAA) and TAA + L. Plantarum. Liver function tests, α fetoprotein (AFP) levels, CXCL9, PREX-2 and TLR4 expression were assessed. Histological studies were performed.
Results
TAA induced significant deterioration in liver functions and increased AFP. There was periportal cirrhosis, vacuolated hepatocytes, decrease hepatocyte parrafin-1 (hep par-1) expression, increase proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive nuclei and cytokeratin AE1/AE3. The PCR results showed significant increase in TLR4, CXCL9 and PREX-2 expression. Early administration of L. Plantarum significantly decreased the expression of TLR4, CXCL9 and PREX-2 together with improvement in liver function and prevented the pathological changes.
Conclusions
The cirrhotic complications induced by TAA are through activation of TLR4/ CXCL9/ PREX-2 pathway and could be prevented by the early administration of L. Plantarum.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeres use shelterin to protect chromosome ends from activating the DNA damage sensor MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN), repressing ataxia-telangiectasia, mutated (ATM) and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) dependent DNA damage checkpoint responses. The MRE11 nuclease is thought to be essential for the resection of the 5′ C-strand to generate the microhomologies necessary for alternative non-homologous end joining (A-NHEJ) repair. In the present study, we uncover DNA damage signaling and repair pathways engaged by components of the replisome complex to repair dysfunctional telomeres. In cells lacking MRN, single-stranded telomeric overhangs devoid of POT1-TPP1 do not recruit replication protein A (RPA), ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP), and RAD 51. Rather, components of the replisome complex, including Claspin, Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and Downstream neighbor of SON (DONSON), initiate DNA-PKcs-mediated p-CHK1 activation and A-NHEJ repair. In addition, Claspin directly interacts with TRF2 and recruits EXO1 to newly replicated telomeres to promote 5′ end resection. Our data indicate that MRN is dispensable for the repair of dysfunctional telomeres lacking POT1-TPP1 and highlight the contributions of the replisome in telomere repair.

Abstract: Summary
Mild reduction in food intake was recently shown to slow polycystic kidney disease (PKD) progression in mouse models, but whether the effect was due to solely reduced calories or some other aspect of the diet has been unclear. We now show that the benefit is due to the induction of ketosis. Time-restricted feeding, without caloric reduction, strongly inhibits mTOR signaling, proliferation, and fibrosis in the affected kidneys in a PKD rat model. A ketogenic diet had a similar effect and led to regression of renal cystic burden. Acute fasting in rat, mouse, and feline models of PKD results in rapid reduction of cyst volume, while oral administration of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in rats strongly inhibits PKD progression. These results suggest that cystic cells in PKD are metabolically inflexible, which could be exploited by dietary interventions or supplementation with BHB, representing a new therapeutic avenue to treat PKD.

Abstract: Summary
Heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can result from activation of distinct signaling pathways. We show that in primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling oppositely modulate multiple CAF effector genes. Genetic abrogation or pharmacological inhibition of either pathway results in induction of genes responsive to the other, with the ETV1 transcription factor mediating the FGF effects. Duality of FGF/TGF-β signaling and differential ETV1 expression occur in multiple CAF strains and fibroblasts of desmoplastic versus non-desmoplastic skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Functionally, HDFs with opposite TGF-β versus FGF modulation converge on promoting cancer cell proliferation. However, HDFs with increased TGF-β signaling enhance invasive properties and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of SCC cells, whereas HDFs with increased FGF signaling promote macrophage infiltration. The findings point to a duality of FGF versus TGF-β signaling in distinct CAF populations that promote cancer development through modulation of different processes.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage tolerance plays a key role in protecting cell viability through translesion synthesis and template switching-mediated bypass of genotoxic polymerase-blocking base lesions. Both tolerance pathways critically rely on ubiquitylation of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) on lysine 164 and have been proposed to operate uncoupled from replication. We report that Ubp10 and Ubp12 ubiquitin proteases differentially cooperate in PCNA deubiquitylation, owing to distinct activities on PCNA-linked ubiquitin chains. Ubp10 and Ubp12 associate with replication forks in a fashion determined by Ubp10 dependency on lagging-strand PCNA residence, and they downregulate translesion polymerase recruitment and template switch events engaging nascent strands. These findings reveal PCNAK164 deubiquitylation as a key mechanism for the modulation of lesion bypass during replication, which might set a framework for establishing strand-differential pathway choices. We propose that damage tolerance is tempered at replication forks to limit the extension of bypass events and sustain chromosome replication rates.

Abstract: Summary
Increased tolerance of Plasmodium falciparum to front-line artemisinin antimalarials (ARTs) is associated with mutations in Kelch13 (K13), although the precise role of K13 remains unclear. Here, we show that K13 mutations result in decreased expression of this protein, while mislocalization of K13 mimics resistance-conferring mutations, pinpointing partial loss of function of K13 as the relevant molecular event. K13-GFP is associated with ∼170 nm diameter doughnut-shaped structures at the parasite periphery, consistent with the location and dimensions of cytostomes. Moreover, the hemoglobin-peptide profile of ring-stage parasites is reduced when K13 is mislocalized. We developed a pulse-SILAC approach to quantify protein turnover and observe less disruption to protein turnover following ART exposure when K13 is mislocalized. Our findings suggest that K13 regulates digestive vacuole biogenesis and the uptake/degradation of hemoglobin and that ART resistance is mediated by a decrease in heme-dependent drug activation, less proteotoxicity, and increased survival of parasite ring stages.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin-stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis is central to glucose homeostasis. Here, we show that PPP1R3G, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is directly phosphorylated by AKT. PPP1R3G phosphorylation fluctuates with fasting-refeeding cycle and is required for insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation, i.e., activation of glycogen synthase (GS) in hepatocytes. In this study, we demonstrate that knockdown of PPP1R3G significantly inhibits insulin response. The introduction of wild-type PPP1R3G, and not phosphorylation-defective mutants, increases hepatic glycogen deposition, blood glucose clearance, and insulin sensitivity in vivo. Mechanistically, phosphorylated PPP1R3G displays increased binding for, and promotes dephosphorylation of, phospho-GS. Furthermore, PPP1R3B, another regulatory subunit of PP1, binds to the dephosphorylated GS, thereby relaying insulin stimulation to hepatic glycogen deposition. Importantly, this PP1-mediated signaling cascade is independent of GSK3. Therefore, we reveal a regulatory axis consisting of insulin/AKT/PPP1R3G/PPP1R3B that operates in parallel to the GSK3-dependent pathway, controlling glycogen synthesis and glucose homeostasis in insulin signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The olfactory environment is first represented by glomerular activity patterns in the olfactory bulb. It remains unclear how these representations intersect with sampling behavior to account for the time required to discriminate odors. Using different chemical classes, we investigate glomerular representations and sniffing behavior during olfactory decision-making. Mice rapidly discriminate odorants and learn to increase sniffing frequency at a fixed latency after trial initiation, independent of odor identity. Relative to the increase in sniffing frequency, monomolecular odorants are discriminated within 10–40 ms, while binary mixtures require an additional 60–70 ms. Intrinsic imaging of glomerular activity in anesthetized and awake mice reveals that Euclidean distance between activity patterns and the time needed for discriminations are anti-correlated. Therefore, the similarity of glomerular patterns and their activation strengths, rather than sampling behavior, define the extent of neuronal processing required for odor discrimination, establishing a neural metric to predict olfactory discrimination time.

Abstract: Summary
Tightly regulated transport of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granules to diverse locations of dendrites and axons is essential for appropriately timed protein synthesis within distinct sub-neuronal compartments. Perturbations of this regulation lead to various neurological disorders. Using imaging and molecular approaches, we demonstrate how TDP-43 co-operates with two other RNA-binding proteins, FMRP and Staufen1, to regulate the anterograde and retrograde transport, respectively, of Rac1 mRNPs in mouse neuronal dendrites. We also analyze the mechanisms by which TDP-43 mediates coupled mRNA transport-translation processes in dendritic sub-compartments by following in real-time the co-movement of RNA and endogenous fluorescence-tagged protein in neurons and by simultaneous examination of transport/translation dynamics by using an RNA biosensor. This study establishes the pivotal roles of TDP-43 in transporting mRNP granules in dendrites, inhibiting translation inside those granules, and reactivating it once the granules reach the dendritic spines.
