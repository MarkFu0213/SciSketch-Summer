Abstract: Background
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can be used in several clinical applications. While MSCs are frequently cultured in fetal bovine serum for in vitro experimentation, human serum supplements are required for cells to be used in patients. Here we show how different human serum supplements and in vitro manipulations used during the cell culture impact on MSC proliferation rate and expression of inflammatory molecules.
Methods
MSCs were cultured in medium supplemented with human plasma or serum combined with human platelet lysate (PL) and/or basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). Real time RT-PCR and western blot were used to assess expression of inflammatory cytokines.
Results
Serum with addition of FGF2 gave the fastest proliferation rate. However, serum with FGF2 also increased expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines. The most favorable expansion condition for chondrogenic differentiation and inhibition of cartilage matrix degrading enzymes was plasma supplemented with PL and FGF2. Detachment of cells using trypsin gave considerable upregulation of inflammatory cytokine mRNAs which lasted for up to 24 h, with concomitant increase in protein levels. Even the gentle act of changing medium led to upregulation of cytokine mRNA, caused by addition of fresh serum.
Discussion
Different culture conditions and simple cell manipulation influence proliferation rate and expression of inflammatory genes. Supplementing culture medium with allogeneic AB serum and FGF2 during monolayer expansion supported cell expansion better than other supplements, but also induced the highest levels of inflammatory cytokines and gave inferior results for chondrogenic differentiation. The importance of the composition of the culture medium and even gentle in vitro manipulation of the cells should be taken into account in the planning of procedures using in vitro expanded MSCs.

Abstract: Hypoxia benefits undifferentiated pluripotent stem cell renewal, and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dioxygenases have been implicated in pluripotent stem cell induction and renewal. We show in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) that an ambient oxygen-induced oxidative stress response elicited by culture in a hypoxic atmosphere (0.5% O2) correlates with the expression of 2OG dioxygenases, which oxidise DNA (TET1, 2, 3) and histone H3 (KDM4C), the former reflected by elevation in genomic 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). siRNA-mediated targeting of KDM4C and TET1–3 induces hESC differentiation. Under ambient atmospheric oxygen (21% O2), exposure to a low inhibitory concentration of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2, IC10), as a model of chemically-induced oxidative stress, suppresses antioxidant gene expression, reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and induces hESC differentiation. Co-administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine promoted anti-oxidant, pluripotency and 2OG dioxygenase gene expression, elevated genomic hydroxymethylation and blocked induction of differentiation. Transient ectopic expression of KDM4C or TET1 in ambient atmospheric oxygen achieved the same. Our study substantiates a role for 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in hypoxia's promotion of undifferentiated hESC self-renewal.

Abstract: Most coronary smooth muscle cells(CoSMCs) are differentiated from epicardial progenitor cells(EPCs), but the specific mechanism is not fully investigated. Previous studies have shown that autophagy plays an important role for smooth muscle cells(SMCs) differentiation, yet whether autophagy is involved in the differentiation of EPCs into CoSMCs remains unclear. In the present study, We first isolated and cultured EPCs and continuously cultured them for 72 h. Then the autophagy induction and inhibition experiment was established by using the autophagy inducer Rapamycin(RAPA) and the inhibitor 3-Methyladenine(3-MA). And further animal experiments were conducted to observe the effects of autophagy on the development of coronary arteries. Our data showed that autophagy occurred in the differentiation of EPCs into SMCs. Over activation of autophagy may lead to early transient differentiation of EPCs, enhanced migration ability and weakened systolic function, but overall, CoSMC development is still inhibited. However, inhibition of autophagy may delay the differentiation of EPCs, thus reducing the number of coronary arteries. Together, all these processes indicate that autophagy may regulate the differentiation of EPCs into CoSMCs by affecting the time point of differentiation, and appropriate autophagy intensity is required during the development of CoSMCs.

Abstract: Summary
Thick-filament sarcomere mutations are a common cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a disorder of heart muscle thickening associated with sudden cardiac death and heart failure, with unclear mechanisms. We engineered four isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of β-myosin heavy chain and myosin-binding protein C3 mutations, and studied iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in cardiac microtissue assays that resemble cardiac architecture and biomechanics. All HCM mutations resulted in hypercontractility with prolonged relaxation kinetics in proportion to mutation pathogenicity, but not changes in calcium handling. RNA sequencing and expression studies of HCM models identified p53 activation, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity induced by metabolic stress that can be reversed by p53 genetic ablation. Our findings implicate hypercontractility as a direct consequence of thick-filament mutations, irrespective of mutation localization, and the p53 pathway as a molecular marker of contraction stress and candidate therapeutic target for HCM patients.

Abstract: Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved, self-eating process that targets cellular constituents for lysosomal degradation. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of autophagy by inducing the expression of genes involved in autophagic and lysosomal degradation. In breast cancer, ligand-activated progesterone receptor has been reported to influence cancer development by manipulating the autophagy pathway. However, understanding of the mechanism that underlies this autophagic response remains limited. Herein, we report that prolonged treatment with progestin R5020 upregulates autophagy in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells via a novel interplay between progesterone receptor B (PRB) and TFEB. R5020 upregulates TFEB gene expression and protein levels in a PRB-dependent manner. Additionally, R5020 enhances the co-recruitment of PRB and TFEB to each other to facilitate TFEB nuclear localization. Once in the nucleus, TFEB induces the expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes to potentiate autophagy. Together, our findings highlight a novel functional connection between ligand-activated PRB and TFEB to modulate autophagy in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. As breast cancer development is controlled by autophagy, the progestin-PRB-TFEB transduction pathway warrants future attention as a potential therapeutic target in cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Murine norovirus (MNoV) infects a low percentage of enteric tuft cells and can persist in these cells for months following acute infection. Both tuft-cell tropism and resistance to interferon-λ (IFN-λ)-mediated clearance during persistent infection requires the viral nonstructural protein 1/2 (NS1/2). We show that processing of NS1/2 yields NS1, an unconventionally secreted viral protein that is central for IFN-λ resistance. MNoV infection globally suppresses intestinal IFN-λ responses, which is attributable to secreted NS1. MNoV NS1 secretion is triggered by caspase-3 cleavage of NS1/2, and a secreted form of human NoV NS1 is also observed. NS1 secretion is essential for intestinal infection and resistance to IFN-λ in vivo. NS1 vaccination alone protects against MNoV challenge, despite the lack of induction of neutralizing anti-capsid antibodies previously shown to confer protection. Thus, despite infecting a low number of tuft cells, NS1 secretion allows MNoV to globally suppress IFN responses and promote persistence.

Abstract: Summary
The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is central to the cell response to stress, inflammatory signals, and toxins. While selective inhibitors are known for JNKs and for various upstream MAP3Ks, no selective inhibitor is reported for MKK7––one of two direct MAP2Ks that activate JNK. Here, using covalent virtual screening, we identify selective MKK7 covalent inhibitors. We optimized these compounds to low-micromolar inhibitors of JNK phosphorylation in cells. The crystal structure of a lead compound bound to MKK7 demonstrated that the binding mode was correctly predicted by docking. We asserted the selectivity of our inhibitors on a proteomic level and against a panel of 76 kinases, and validated an on-target effect using knockout cell lines. Lastly, we show that the inhibitors block activation of primary mouse B cells by lipopolysaccharide. These MKK7 tool compounds will enable better investigation of JNK signaling and may serve as starting points for therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Calprotectin (CP) inhibits bacterial viability through extracellular chelation of transition metals. However, how CP influences general metabolism remains largely unexplored. We show here that CP restricts bioavailable Zn and Fe to the pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, inducing an extensive multi-metal perturbation of cellular physiology. Proteomics reveals severe metal starvation, and a strain lacking the candidate ZnII metallochaperone ZigA possesses altered cellular abundance of multiple essential Zn-dependent enzymes and enzymes in de novo flavin biosynthesis. The ΔzigA strain exhibits decreased cellular flavin levels during metal starvation. Flavin mononucleotide provides regulation of this biosynthesis pathway, via a 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase (RibB) fusion protein, RibBX, and authentic RibB. We propose that RibBX ensures flavin sufficiency under CP-induced Fe limitation, allowing flavodoxins to substitute for Fe-ferredoxins as cell reductants. These studies elucidate adaptation to nutritional immunity and define an intersection between metallostasis and cellular metabolism in A. baumannii.

Abstract: Summary
Topoisomerase II cleaves DNA at preferred sequences with different efficiencies; however, the mechanism of cleavage site selection is not known. Here we used single-molecule fluorescence assays that monitor several critical steps of DNA-topoisomerase II interactions, including binding/dissociation, bending/straightening, and cleavage/religation, and reveal that the cleavage site is selected mainly during the bending step. Furthermore, despite the sensitivity of the bending rate to the DNA sequence, it is not an intrinsic property of the DNA itself. Rather, it is determined by protein-DNA interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Inherent plasticity and various survival cues allow glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) to survive and proliferate under intrinsic and extrinsic stress conditions. Here, we report that GSCs depend on the adaptive activation of ER stress and subsequent activation of lipogenesis and particularly stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD1), which promotes ER homeostasis, cytoprotection, and tumor initiation. Pharmacological targeting of SCD1 is particularly toxic due to the accumulation of saturated fatty acids, which exacerbates ER stress, triggers apoptosis, impairs RAD51-mediated DNA repair, and achieves a remarkable therapeutic outcome with 25%–100% cure rate in xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, divergent cell fates under varying levels of ER stress are primarily controlled by the ER sensor IRE1, which either promotes SCD1 transcriptional activation or converts to apoptotic signaling when SCD1 activity is impaired. Taken together, the dependence of GSCs on fatty acid desaturation presents an exploitable vulnerability to target glioblastoma.

Abstract: Autophagy is a highly regulated intracellular process to maintain cellular homeostasis by degrading damaged proteins and organelles. Dysregulation of autophagic activity in cardiomyocytes is implicated in various heart diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms of cardiomyocyte autophagy are not yet known. In this study, the enhanced cardiomyocyte autophagy was induced by angiotensin II (0.1 μmol/L), demonstrated by the increase of double-membraned autophagosomes, BECN1 expression, and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. Microarray assay showed that a total of 197 genes were differentially expressed in angiotensin II–treated cardiomyocytes, including 22 upregulated and 175 downregulated. Gene ontology functional enrichment analysis showed that nearly 50% of differentially expressed genes were related to metabolism and energy maintenance in biological process. Pathway analysis showed that most frequently represented pathways were involved in metabolism and the citric acid cycle and respiratory electron transport. Based on KEGG database, 10 differentially expressed genes were found to be involved in autophagic signaling pathways. The hub genes with high degree were predicted to regulate cardiomyocyte autophagy activity by PPI network analysis. NEDD4, the top focus hub gene, showed a clear time-dependent increased expression pattern in cardiomyocytes during angiotensin II treatment. Moreover, inhibition of NEDD4 could significantly reduce cardiomyocyte autophagy induced by angiotensin II. In summary, the cardiomyocyte autophagy–related genes were screened by microarray assay combining with bioinformatics analysis. The role of NEDD4 on cardiomyocyte autophagy might provide valuable clues to finding therapeutic targets for heart diseases.

Abstract: This study analyzed the interaction of commercial monoclonal anti-methylglyoxal antibodies that predominantly recognize argpyrimidine with unmodified and modified model proteins and small heat shock proteins. These antibodies specifically recognize methylglyoxal (MG)-modified bovine serum albumin and lysozyme, but they react equally well with both unmodified and MG-modified HspB1. Mutation R188W decreased the interaction of these antibodies with unmodified HspB1, thus indicating that this residue participates in the formation of antigenic determinant. However, these antibodies did not recognize either short (ESRAQ) or long (IPVTFESRAQLGGP) peptides with primary structure identical to that at Arg188 of HspB1. Neither of the peptides obtained after the cleavage of HspB1 at Met or Cys residues were recognized by anti-argpyrimidine antibodies. This means that unmodified HspB1 contains a discontinuous epitope that includes the sequence around Arg188 and that this epitope is recognized by anti-argpyrimidine antibodies in unmodified HspB1. Incubation of HspB1 with MG is accompanied by the accumulation of hydroimidazolones, but not argpyrimidines. Therefore, conclusions based on utilization of anti-argpyrimidine antibodies and indicating that HspB1 is the predominant and preferential target of MG modification in the cell require revision.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinase 14 (CDK14) and other TAIRE family kinases (CDKs 15–18) are proteins that lack functional annotation but are frequent off-targets of clinical kinase inhibitors. In this study we develop and characterize FMF-04-159-2, a tool compound that specifically targets CDK14 covalently and possesses a TAIRE kinase-biased selectivity profile. This tool compound and its reversible analog were used to characterize the cellular consequences of covalent CDK14 inhibition, including an unbiased investigation using phospho-proteomics. To reduce confounding off-target activity, washout conditions were used to deconvolute CDK14-specific effects. This investigation suggested that CDK14 plays a supporting role in cell-cycle regulation, particularly mitotic progression, and identified putative CDK14 substrates. Together, these results represent an important step forward in understanding the cellular consequences of inhibiting CDK14 kinase activity.

Abstract: Summary
Lymph- and blood-borne retroviruses exploit CD169/Siglec-1-mediated capture by subcapsular sinus and marginal zone metallophilic macrophages for trans-infection of permissive lymphocytes. However, the impact of CD169-mediated virus capture on retrovirus dissemination and pathogenesis in vivo is unknown. In a murine model of the splenomegaly-inducing retrovirus Friend virus complex (FVC) infection, we find that while CD169 promoted draining lymph node infection, it limited systemic spread to the spleen. At the spleen, CD169-expressing macrophages captured incoming blood-borne retroviruses and limited their spread to the erythroblasts in the red pulp where FVC manifests its pathogenesis. CD169-mediated retroviral capture activated conventional dendritic cells 1 (cDC1s) and promoted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses, resulting in efficient clearing of FVC-infected cells. Accordingly, CD169 blockade led to higher viral loads and accelerated death in susceptible mouse strains. Thus, CD169 plays a protective role during FVC pathogenesis by reducing viral dissemination to erythroblasts and eliciting an effective cytotoxic T lymphocyte response via cDC1s.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by alterations in the intestinal microbiota and altered immune responses to gut microbiota. Evidence is accumulating that IBD is influenced by not only commensal bacteria but also commensal fungi. We characterized fungi directly associated with the intestinal mucosa in healthy people and Crohn’s disease patients and identified fungi specifically abundant in patients. One of these, the common skin resident fungus Malassezia restricta, is also linked to the presence of an IBD-associated polymorphism in the gene for CARD9, a signaling adaptor important for anti-fungal defense. M. restricta elicits innate inflammatory responses largely through CARD9 and is recognized by Crohn’s disease patient anti-fungal antibodies. This yeast elicits strong inflammatory cytokine production from innate cells harboring the IBD-linked polymorphism in CARD9 and exacerbates colitis via CARD9 in mouse models of disease. Collectively, these results suggest that targeting specific commensal fungi may be a therapeutic strategy for IBD.

Abstract: Increasing evidence has indicated that intimal hyperplasia is a common event in the pathophysiology of many vascular diseases including atherosclerosis (AS). Recently, deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be associated with the pathophysiology of AS. However, the biological function and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in intimal hyperplasia in AS remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of miRNAs on intimal hyperplasia and reveal the underlying mechanisms of their effects. Firstly, the model of rat vascular injury was successfully constructed in vivo. Then, the miRNAs expression profiles were analyzed by miRNA microarray. It was observed that miR-451 was significantly downregulated in injury carotid arteries. Subsequently, we investigated miR-451 function and found that upregulation of miR-451 by agomir-451 improves intimal thickening in rats following vascular injury. It was also observed that miR-451 was downregulated in the VSMCs following platelet-derived growth factor type BB (PDGF-BB) stimulation. The upregulation of miR-451 attenuated PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs injury, as evidenced by inhibition of proliferation, invasion and migration. Besides, overexpression of miR-451 blocked the activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in PDGF-BB treated VSMCs, as demonstrated by the downregulation of phosphorylated (p-) p38. In addition, Ywhaz, a positive regulator of p38 MAPK signaling pathway, was found to be a direct target of miR-451 in the VSMCs and this was validated using a luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression of Ywhaz partially abolished the inhibitory effects of miR-451 overexpression on PDGF-BB induced VSMCs injury. Collectively, these findings indicated that miR-451 protected intimal hyperplasia and PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs injury by Ywhaz/p38 MAPK pathway, and miR-451 may be considered as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of AS.

The CiA:Oct4 allele contains an engineered EGFP reporter replacing one copy of the Oct4 gene, with an upstream Gal4 array in the promoter that allows recruitment of chromatin modifying machinery. We stimulated gene activation of the CiA:Oct4 allele by binding a transcriptional activator to the Gal4 array. As with cellular reprograming, this process is inefficient with only a small percentage of the cells re-activating CiA:Oct4 after weeks. Epigenetic barriers to gene activation potentially come from heavy DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, chromatin compaction, and other posttranslational marks (PTM) at the differentiated CiA:Oct4 allele in MEFs. Using this platform, we performed a high-throughput chemical screen for compounds that increased the efficiency of activation. We found that Azacytidine and newer generation histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors were the most efficient at facilitating directed transcriptional activation of this allele. We found one hit form our screen, Mocetinostat, improved iPSC generation under transcription factor reprogramming conditions. These results separate individual allele activation from whole cell reprograming and give new insights that will advance tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Physical exercise stimulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis and is considered a relevant strategy for preventing age-related cognitive decline in humans. The underlying mechanisms remains controversial. Here, we show that exercise increases proliferation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) of the mouse dentate gyrus (DG) via downregulation of microRNA 135a-5p (miR-135a). MiR-135a inhibition stimulates NPC proliferation leading to increased neurogenesis, but not astrogliogenesis, in DG of resting mice, and intriguingly it re-activates NPC proliferation in aged mice. We identify 17 proteins (11 putative targets) modulated by miR-135 in NPCs. Of note, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor 1 and inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type I are among the modulated proteins, suggesting that IP3 signaling may act downstream miR-135. miR-135 is the first noncoding RNA essential modulator of the brain's response to physical exercise. Prospectively, the miR-135-IP3 axis might represent a novel target of therapeutic intervention to prevent pathological brain aging.

Abstract: Summary
The initiation and execution of cell death can be regulated by various lipids. How the levels of environmental (exogenous) lipids impact cell death sensitivity is not well understood. We find that exogenous monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) potently inhibit the non-apoptotic, iron-dependent, oxidative cell death process of ferroptosis. This protective effect is associated with the suppression of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation at the plasma membrane and decreased levels of phospholipids containing oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids. Treatment with exogenous MUFAs reduces the sensitivity of plasma membrane lipids to oxidation over several hours. This effect requires MUFA activation by acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long-chain family member 3 (ACSL3) and is independent of lipid droplet formation. Exogenous MUFAs also protect cells from apoptotic lipotoxicity caused by the accumulation of saturated fatty acids, but in an ACSL3-independent manner. Our work demonstrates that ACSL3-dependent MUFA activation promotes a ferroptosis-resistant cell state.

Abstract: Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia (glycolipotoxicity)-triggered islet β-cell dysfunction is known to drive the progression of obesity-related type 2 diabetes, however the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. The current study aimed to investigate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 5 (MKP-5) in islet cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Using gene overexpression and knockdown approaches, we demonstrated that MKP-5 could alleviate glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways owing to the altered regulation of caspase family members and ER stress-related molecules in MIN6 and primary islet cells. Overexpression of MKP-5 reversed the glucose and palmitic acid (GP)-induced impairment of insulin secretion as well as the abnormal decreases in the expression of islet functional genes, thereby maintaining the normal insulin secretory functionality, whereas the absence of MKP-5 aggravated islet cell dysfunction. In parallel, the production of ROS and increased inflammation-associated genes in response to GP were also reduced upon MKP-5 overexpression. Further, inhibition of JNK or P38 MAPK pathways resisted to glucolipotoxicity observed in MKP-5 knockdown MIN6 cells. These findings indicate that MKP-5 is an important mediator for glucolipotoxicity-induced islet cell dysfunction and apoptosis, with JNK and P38 as the critical downstream pathways.

Abstract: Summary
DACH1 abundance is reduced in human malignancies, including breast cancer. Herein DACH1 was detected among multipotent fetal mammary stem cells in the embryo, among mixed lineage precursors, and in adult basal cells and (ERα+) luminal progenitors. Dach1 gene deletion at 6 weeks in transgenic mice reduced ductal branching, reduced the proportion of mammary basal cells (Lin− CD24med CD29high) and reduced abundance of basal cytokeratin 5, whereas DACH1 overexpression induced ductal branching, increased Gata3 and Notch1, and expanded mammosphere formation in LA-7 breast cells. Mammary gland-transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) activity, known to reduce ductal branching and to reduce the basal cell population, increased upon Dach1 deletion, associated with increased SMAD phosphorylation. Association of the scaffold protein Smad anchor for receptor activation with Smad2/3, which facilitates TGF-β activation, was reduced by endogenous DACH1. DACH1 increases basal cells, enhances ductal formation and restrains TGF-β activity in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Several protocols now support efficient differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) but these still indicate line-to-line variability. As the number of studies implementing this technology expands, accurate assessment of cell identity is paramount to well-defined studies that can be replicated among laboratories. While flow cytometry is apt for routine assessment, a standardized protocol for assessing cardiomyocyte identity has not yet been established. Therefore, the current study leveraged targeted mass spectrometry to confirm the presence of troponin proteins in day 25 hPSC-CMs and systematically evaluated multiple anti-troponin antibodies and sample preparation protocols for their suitability in assessing cardiomyocyte identity. Results demonstrate challenges to interpreting data generated by published methods and inform the development of a robust protocol for routine assessment of hPSC-CMs. The data, workflow for antibody evaluation, and standardized protocol described here should benefit investigators new to this field and those with expertise in hPSC-CM differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The adult CNS has poor ability to replace degenerated neurons following injury or disease. Recently, direct reprogramming of astrocytes into induced neurons has been proposed as an innovative strategy toward CNS repair. As a cell population that shows high diversity on physiological properties and functions depending on their spatiotemporal distribution, however, whether the astrocyte heterogeneity affect neuronal reprogramming is not clear. Here, we show that astrocytes derived from cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord exhibit biological heterogeneity and possess distinct susceptibility to transcription factor-induced neuronal reprogramming. The heterogeneous expression level of NOTCH1 signaling in the different CNS regions-derived astrocytes is shown to be responsible for the neuronal reprogramming diversity. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that region-restricted astrocytes reveal different intrinsic limitation of the response to neuronal reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Viral glycoproteins are under constant immune surveillance by a host’s adaptive immune responses. Antigenic variation including glycan introduction or removal is among the mechanisms viruses have evolved to escape host immunity. Understanding how glycosylation affects immunodominance on complex protein antigens may help decipher underlying B cell biology. To determine how B cell responses can be altered by such modifications, we engineered glycans onto the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and characterized the molecular features of the elicited humoral immunity in mice. We found that glycan addition changed the initially diverse antibody repertoire into an epitope-focused, genetically restricted response. Structural analyses showed that one antibody gene family targeted a previously subdominant, occluded epitope at the head interface. Passive transfer of this antibody conferred Fc-dependent protection to influenza virus-challenged mice. These results have potential implications for next-generation viral vaccines aimed at directing B cell responses to preferred epitope(s).

Abstract: Summary
Molecules capable of directing changes to nucleic acid sequences are powerful tools for molecular biology and promising candidates for the therapeutic correction of disease-causing mutations. However, unwanted reactions at off-target sites complicate their use. Here we report selective combinations of mutant editing enzyme and directing oligonucleotide. Mutations in human ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2) that introduce aromatic amino acids at position 488 reduce background RNA editing. This residue is juxtaposed to the nucleobase that pairs with the editing site adenine, suggesting a steric clash for the bulky mutants. Replacing this nucleobase with a hydrogen atom removes the clash and restores editing activity. A crystal structure of the E488Y mutant bound to abasic site-containing RNA shows the accommodation of the tyrosine side chain. Finally, we demonstrate directed RNA editing in vitro and in human cells using mutant ADAR2 proteins and modified guide RNAs with reduced off-target activity.

Abstract: CSN5 is a critical subunit of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) and has been involved in various cellular processes, but little is known about the role of CSN5 in cardiac disease. In the present study, we found that the expression of CSN5 was increased in Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophic mice hearts and Ang II-treated cardiomyocytes. We also observed that overexpression of CSN5 significantly inhibited Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, whereas CSN5 silence exhibited the opposite phenotypes. Further investigation demonstrated that CSN5 maintained the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cardiomyocyte by enhancement of LKB1. Mechanistically, we found that CSN5 directly interacted and deubiquitinated LKB1 for its stabilization in cardiomyocytes. Finally, our results demonstrated that the anti-hypertrophic effect of CSN5 was partially dependent on stabilization of LKB1. Collectively, these findings suggested that strategies based on activation of CSN5/LKB1 axis might be promising in the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: Growing evidences demonstrate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to the cancer initiation and progression and are considered as promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets of multiple cancers. However, the definite role of LINC00536 in bladder cancer (BC) remains unclear. In the present study, we found LINC00536 expression was highly expressed in BC tissues compared with controls and negatively associated with survival rate in BC patients. Gain-of-function assays indicated that LINC00536 overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas LINC00536 knockdown attenuated the cell phenotypes above in BC cell lines. In vivo assay illustrated that LINC00536 knockdown inhibited BC growth in vivo. Mechanistically, Wnt3a was identified as the target of LINC00536. LINC00536 promoted malignant phenotypes via activating the Wnt3a/β-Catenin signaling. Wnt3a knockdown reversed the increase of proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of BC cells induced by LINC00536 overexpression. In summary, our findings demonstrated that LINC00536 promoted BC progression by modulating the Wnt3a/β-Catenin signaling.

Abstract: Aberrant activity of Rho small G-proteins and their regulators plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10-Like (ARHGEF10L) is a member of the RhoGEF family that promotes the active GTP-bound state of Rho GTPases. This study used the Illumina GoldenGate microassay, Sequenom MassARRAY and TaqMan to analyze possible correlations between tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) in the ARHGEF10L locus and various tumor risks. The genotyping analyses demonstrated a strong association of rs2244444 and rs12732894 with liver cancer. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry also revealed increased expression of ARHGEF10L in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Furthermore, increased cell proliferation, cell migration and RhoA activity; increased expression of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase-1 (ROCK1), phospho- Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERM), vimentin, N-cadherin and Slug, and decreased E-cadherin expression were detected in hepatocellular carcinoma cell Bel-7402 and HepG2 cells with transfection of ARHGEF10L-expressing plasmids. Opposite results were obtained in the two cell lines with transfection of anti-ARHGEF10L siRNA. Tumor-bearing mice were generated with Bel-7402 cells transfected with lentivirus vectors packaging short hairpin ARHGEF10L RNA. The xenograft tumors with the inhibited ARHGEF10L expression showed decreased tumor growth and expression of vimentin, N-cadherin and Slug. Additionally, decreased phospho-ERM expression was detected in Bel-7402 and HepG2 cells with transfection of anti-ROCK1 siRNA and increased expression of ROCK1 was detected in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. E-cadherin, vimentin, N-cadherin and Slug are markers of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). ROCK1, phospho-ERM and EMT have been reported to promote tumor cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis. Our study suggests that increased expression of ARHGEF10L stimulates hepatocellular tumorigenesis by activating the RhoA-ROCK1- phospho ERM pathway and EMT.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their interactions with recipient cells constitute a rapidly growing research area. However, due to the limitations in current methodologies, the mechanisms of these interactions are still unclear. Microscopic studies of EVs are challenging, because their typical diameter is near the resolution limit of light microscopy, and electron microscopy has restricted possibilities for protein labelling. The objective of this study was to combine these two techniques to demonstrate in detail the interactions of EVs by recipient cells. Hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) is an integral transmembrane protein that is enriched in EVs. In this work, GFP-HAS3 was utilized to study the interactions of EVs with the recipient cells. Surprisingly, confocal analysis correlation with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that most of the EVs were indeed lying on the recipient cell's plasma membrane, while the level of EV-derived intracellular signal was low. Immunoelectron microscopy supported this finding. Furthermore, hyaluronan oligosaccharides decreased the numbers of bound EVs, suggesting that CD44 participates in the regulation of their binding. This study indicates that correlative light and electron microscopy is a reliable method to analyze EV interactions with recipient cells. Detailed 3D confocal imaging of EV carrying a GFP-label on their plasma membrane combined with high-resolution electron microscopy provides significantly more information than either of the techniques alone. In the future studies it is crucial to utilize these techniques and their combinations to solve in detail the ambiguous fate of EV in target cells. Furthermore, live cell imaging at high resolution will be required to obtain definite answers on the detailed mechanisms of binding, fusion and endocytosis of EVs.

Abstract: Fatty acid-induced lipotoxicity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Our previous studies have documented that lipotoxicity contributes to the onset and development of diabetes via insulin resistance and/or compromised function of the pancreatic β-cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms associating lipotoxicity with insulin resistance remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the role of TRB3-COP1-SIRT1 in lipotoxicity leading to insulin resistance in hepatocytes. High fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and hepG2 cells stimulated with palmitate were utilized as models of lipid metabolism disorders. We analyzed the interactions of SIRT1 and COP1 with each other and with TRB3 using co-immunoprecipitation, western blotting. SIRT1 ubiquitination was also explored. Animal and cell experiments showed that lipotoxicity induced SIRT1 down-regulation at the protein level without altering the mRNA level, whereas, lipotoxicity led to up-regulation of TRB3 and COP1 at both the gene and protein levels. Mechanistic analysis indicated that COP1 functioned as an E3 Ub-ligase of SIRT1, responsible for its proteasomal degradation under lipotoxic conditions. TRB3 recruited COP1 to SIRT1 to promote its ubiquitination. Our data indicated for the first time that TRB3-COP1-SIRT1 pathway played an important role in lipotoxicity leading to insulin resistance in hepatocytes, and suggested that COP1 could be a potential therapeutic choice for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, with lipotoxicity being the important pathomechanism.

Abstract: Metabolic studies of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have focused on how the cells produce energy through the catabolic pathway. The less-studied anabolic pathway, by which hPSCs expend energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is not yet fully understood. Compared to fully differentiated somatic cells, hPSCs undergo significant changes not only in their gene expression but also in their production and/or expenditure of ATP. Here, we investigate how hPSCs tightly control their energy homeostasis by studying the main energy-consuming process, mRNA translation. In addition, change of subcellular organelles regarding energy homeostasis has been investigated. Lysosomes are organelles that play an important role in the elimination of unnecessary cellular materials by digestion and in the recycling system of the cell. We have found that hPSCs control their lysosome numbers in part by regulating lysosomal gene/protein expression. Thus, because the levels of mRNA translation rate are lower in hPSCs than in somatic cells, not only the global translational machinery but also the lysosomal recycling machinery is suppressed in hPSCs. Overall, the results of our study suggest that hPSCs reprogram gene expression and signaling to regulate energy-consuming processes and energy-controlling organelles.

Abstract: Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of the liver metabolism due to functional deficiency of the peroxisomal enzyme alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). AGT deficiency results in overproduction of oxalate which complexes with calcium to form insoluble calcium-oxalate salts in urinary tracts, ultimately leading to end-stage renal disease. Currently, the only curative treatment for PH1 is combined liver-kidney transplantation, which is limited by donor organ shortage and lifelong requirement for immunosuppression. Transplantation of genetically modified autologous hepatocytes is an attractive therapeutic option for PH1. However, the use of fresh primary hepatocytes suffers from limitations such as organ availability, insufficient cell proliferation, loss of function, and the risk of immune rejection. We developed patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (PH1-iPSCs) free of reprogramming factors as a source of renewable and genetically defined autologous PH1-hepatocytes. We then investigated additive gene therapy using a lentiviral vector encoding wild-type AGT under the control of the liver-specific transthyretin promoter. Genetically modified PH1-iPSCs successfully provided hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) that exhibited significant AGT expression at both RNA and protein levels after liver-specific differentiation process. These results pave the way for cell-based therapy of PH1 by transplantation of genetically modified autologous HLCs derived from patient-specific iPSCs.

Abstract: Intracellular protein crystallization occurs under various physiological and pathological settings, yet the underlying cellular processes remain enigmatic. After validating individual crystallization events using cellular proteins that readily crystallize in the ER (NEU1), cytosol (crystallin-γD mutant) or nucleus (CLC protein), I demonstrate three independent crystallization events can take place concurrently in different subcellular compartments of a single cell without compromising cell viability. By co-expressing NEU1 and previously reported two human monoclonal antibodies that undergo crystallization and liquid-liquid phase separation in the ER, I additionally demonstrate two independent phase separation events can be simultaneously induced in the ER lumen of a single cell without mixing or interfering each other's phase separation behaviors. Intracellular protein crystallization thus takes place in a crowded physiological cellular environment and does not require high protein purity. Furthermore, I report a simple method to increase the yield of intracellular protein crystals by treating the cells with a topoisomerase II inhibitor that blocks cell division without preventing cell size growth.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cell-derived vascular smooth muscle cells (hPSC-VSMCs) are of great value for disease modeling, drug screening, cell therapies, and tissue engineering. However, producing a high quantity of hPSC-VSMCs with current cell culture technologies remains very challenging. Here, we report a scalable method for manufacturing hPSC-VSMCs in alginate hydrogel microtubes (i.e., AlgTubes), which protect cells from hydrodynamic stresses and limit cell mass to <400 μm to ensure efficient mass transport. The tubes provide cells a friendly microenvironment, leading to extremely high culture efficiency. We have shown that hPSC-VSMCs can be generated in 10 days with high viability, high purity, and high yield (∼5.0 × 108 cells/mL). Phenotype and gene expression showed that VSMCs made in AlgTubes and VSMCs made in 2D cultures were similar overall. However, AlgTube-VSMCs had higher expression of genes related to vasculature development and angiogenesis, and 2D-VSMCs had higher expression of genes related to cell death and biosynthetic processes.

Abstract: Aneuploidy refers to aberrancies in cellular chromosome count, which is prevalent in most human cancers. Chemotherapy is an effective cancer treatment; however, the development of drug resistance is a major concern of conventional chemotherapy. The chemotherapy agent hydroxyurea (HU) targets proliferating cells and has long been applied to treat various human cancers. It remains elusive whether aneuploidy affects the drug sensitivity of hydroxyurea. By generating an inducible aneuploidy model, we found that aneuploid colon cancer cells were resistant to HU treatment compared to euploid controls. Surprisingly, further analyses showed that the HU resistance was dependent on the expression of wild type p53. Activation of the p53 pathway in aneuploidy cells reduced cell proliferation but generated resistance of tumor cells to HU treatment. HU resistance was abrogated in aneuploid cells if p53 was absent but re-gained when inducing proliferation repression in cells by serum deprivation. Our results demonstrate that the HU resistance developed in aneuploid colon cancer cells is mediated by wild type p53 and indicates the prognostic value of combining karyotypic and p53 status in clinical cancer treatment.

Abstract: Acute brain reperfusion stress is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction through unknown mechanisms. Accordingly, there is no effective drug to control the development and progression of brain reperfusion stress currently. The aim of our investigation is to verify whether melatonin attenuates acute brain reperfusion stress via affecting mitochondrial function. Our studies demonstrated that melatonin treatment suppressed reperfusion-induced neuron death. At the molecular levels, melatonin treatment modulated mitochondrial homeostasis via activating mitochondrial fusion. At the stage of reperfusion, MFN2 expression was downregulated, contributing to mitochondrial fusion inhibition. Interestingly, MFN2-related mitochondrial fusion was reversed by melatonin. Loss of MFN2-related mitochondrial fusion abrogated the protective actions of melatonin on mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, melatonin sustained MFN2-related mitochondrial fusion via suppressing Mst1-Hippo pathway. Overexpression of Mst1 attenuated the beneficial effects of melatonin on mitochondrial fusion, evoking mitochondrial damage and neuron death in the setting of brain reperfusion stress. Taken together, our results confirmed the protective effects of melatonin on acute brain reperfusion stress. Melatonin treatment activated MFN2-related mitochondrial fusion via suppressing Mst1-Hippo pathway, finally sustaining mitochondrial function and reducing reperfusion-mediated cerebral injury.

Abstract: Endometriosis, a common gynecological disease, is associated with pelvic pain and infertility. Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of women, but that number increases to 30–50% in symptomatic premenopausal women. Despite the prevalence of endometriosis, the cause has yet to be fully elucidated. Recent study of the molecular pathways of endometrial cancer has brought the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 to our attention. In this paper, we explored the role of lncRNA-H19 in endometrial tissue proliferation. We found that ectopic endometrial cells taken from women with endometriosis showed elevated levels of lncRNA-H19, with expression levels correlating to disease progression. Knockdown of H19 in ectopic endometrial cells inhibited cell proliferation and invasion. Coinciding with this change was an increase in microRNA-124-3p (miR-124-3p) and a decrease in integrin beta-3 (ITGB3) levels. The addition of a miR-124-3p inhibitor mitigated this decrease in ITGB3. Up-regulation of miR-124-3p markedly suppressed ITGB3 expression by binding to the 3′ untranslated region (3’ UTR), while inhibition of miR-124-3p had the opposite effect. ITGB3 overexpression potently counteracted the effects of miR-124-3p mimics on ectopic endometrial cells. From these results, we can infer that in endometriosis both miR-124-3p and ITGB3 operate as downstream effector proteins in the H19-signaling pathway. Down-regulation of lncRNA-H19 could inhibit ectopic endometrial cell proliferation and invasion by modulating miR-124-3p and ITGB3, offering a novel target for treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The virome is one of the most variable components of the human gut microbiome. Within twin pairs, viromes have been shown to be similar for infants, but not for adults, indicating that as twins age and their environments and microbiomes diverge, so do their viromes. The degree to which the microbiome drives the vast virome diversity is unclear. Here, we examine the relationship between microbiome and virome diversity in 21 adult monozygotic twin pairs selected for high or low microbiome concordance. Viromes derived from virus-like particles are unique to each individual, are dominated by Caudovirales and Microviridae, and exhibit a small core that includes crAssphage. Microbiome-discordant twins display more dissimilar viromes compared to microbiome-concordant twins, and the richer the microbiomes, the richer the viromes. These patterns are driven by bacteriophages, not eukaryotic viruses. Collectively, these observations support a strong role of the microbiome in patterning for the virome.

Abstract: Slow-cycling and treatment-resistant cancer cells escape therapy, providing a rationale for regrowth and recurrence in patients. Much interest has focused on identifying the properties of slow-cycling tumor cells in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and lethal primary brain tumor. Despite aggressive ionizing radiation (IR) and treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ), GBM patients invariably relapse and ultimately succumb to the disease. In patient biopsies, we demonstrated that GBM cells expressing the proliferation markers Ki67 and MCM2 displayed a larger cell volume compared to rare slow-cycling tumor cells. In optimized density gradients, we isolated a minor fraction of slow-cycling GBM cells in patient biopsies and tumorsphere cultures. Transcriptional profiling, self-renewal, and tumorigenicity assays reflected the slow-cycling state of high-density GBM cells (HDGCs) compared to the tumor bulk of low-density GBM cells (LDGCs). Slow-cycling HDGCs enriched for stem cell antigens proliferated a few days after isolation to generate LDGCs. Both in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrated that HDGCs show increased treatment-resistance to IR and TMZ treatment compared to LDGCs. In conclusion, density gradients represent a non-marker based approach to isolate slow-cycling and treatment-resistant GBM cells across GBM subgroups.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease and hard to cure at present. Alpha B-crystallin (CRYAB) has been identified as a downregulated gene in OA cartilage. However, the precise roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of CRYAB in OA progression have not been elucidated. In the present study, we found that the expression of CRYAB in cartilages from patients with OA was significantly lower than that in the cartilages from patients with no prior medical history of OA. We established mouse models with OA by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery and found that the expression of CRYAB in OA cartilage was lower than that in the normal cartilages, too. Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression of CRYAB was increased during chondrogenic differentiation and cartilage development. Functional assays revealed that overexpression of CRYAB promoted the proliferation of chondrocytes and inhibited apoptosis, while knockdown of CRYAB presented opposite results. In addition, overexpression of CRYAB upregulated the expression of anabolic markers, Col2a1 and ACAN, and reduced the expression of catabolic markers, MMP13 and ADAMTS5. Conversely, knockdown of CRYAB blocked the expression of the anabolic markers and increased the expression of catabolic markers. Collectively, the results suggest that CRYAB promoted the proliferation and extracellular matrix production of chondrocytes, and inhibited chondrocytes apoptosis and cartilage degradation simultaneously. Thus, CRYAB might be a potential therapeutic target for OA treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) begins after fertilization and is essential for establishing pluripotency and genome stability. However, it is unclear how ZGA genes prevent mitotic errors. Here we show that knockout of the ZGA gene Zscan5b, which encodes a SCAN domain with C2H2 zinc fingers, causes a high incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and leads to the development of early-stage cancers. After irradiation, Zscan5b-deficient ESCs displayed significantly increased levels of γ-H2AX despite increased expression of the DNA repair genes Rad51l3 and Bard. Re-expression of Zscan5b reduced γ-H2AX content, implying a role for Zscan5b in DNA damage repair processes. A co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that Zscan5b bound to the linker histone H1, suggesting that Zscan5b may protect chromosomal architecture. Our report demonstrates that the ZGA gene Zscan5b is involved in genomic integrity and acts to promote DNA damage repair and regulate chromatin dynamics during mitosis.

Abstract: Poly(A)-binding protein-interacting protein 1 (Paip1) was discovered as a modulator of translation initiation as a result of binding to PABP. Increasing evidence suggested that Paip1 has been implicated in several pathogenic roles. However, its clinical significance and underlying molecular mechanisms in Pancreatic cancer (PC) remain uncertain. In our present study, we found that Paip1 was over-expressed in human PC tissues. As well as poor survival, the over-expression of Paip1 was associated with lymph node (LN) metastasis of the PC samples analyzed. Paip1 silencing inhibits PC cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis, whereas over-expression of Paip1 produces the opposite effects. In all, we proposed that Paip1 contributes to PC progression and appears to be a valid prognostic factor of PC.

Abstract: Summary
RNA silencing (RNAi) has a well-established role in anti-viral immunity in plants. The destructive eukaryotic pathogen Phytophthora encodes suppressors of RNAi (PSRs), which enhance plant susceptibility. However, the role of small RNAs in defense against eukaryotic pathogens is unclear. Here, we show that Phytophthora infection of Arabidopsis leads to increased production of a diverse pool of secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Instead of regulating endogenous plant genes, these siRNAs are found in extracellular vesicles and likely silence target genes in Phytophthora during natural infection. Introduction of a plant siRNA in Phytophthora leads to developmental deficiency and abolishes virulence, while Arabidopsis mutants defective in secondary siRNA biogenesis are hypersusceptible. Notably, Phytophthora effector PSR2 specifically inhibits secondary siRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis and promotes infection. These findings uncover the role of siRNAs as antimicrobial agents against eukaryotic pathogens and highlight a defense/counter-defense arms race centered on trans-kingdom gene silencing between hosts and pathogens.

Abstract: Oversecretion of Mucin5ac (MUC5AC), which is primarily synthesized by goblet cells and is the major gel-forming mucin, is a hallmark of various pulmonary inflammatory diseases. Hypoxia is considered a common pathophysiologic feature in various pulmonary inflammatory diseases. It has been suggested that hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) acts as a key factor in hypoxia-induced MUC5AC hypersecretion; however, the exact mechanisms that maintain the stability of HIF-1α and support oversecretion by airway epithelial cells under hypoxia are still unclear. With immunohistochemistry, we found overexpression of anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) in the bronchial epithelial cells of hypoxia-treated mice. With specific shRNA transduction, AGR2 was demonstrated to be a key factor in MUC5AC hypersecretion in vitro. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation, cell immunochemistry and confocal microscopy experiments were performed to explore the interaction between HIF-1α and AGR2 during hypoxia-induced MUC5AC hypersecretion in vitro. The results indicated increased binding and intracytoplasmic colocation of HIF-1α and AGR2. Our findings suggest that AGR2 acts as a key regulator in hypoxia-induced airway MUC5AC hypersecretion by increasing the stability of HIF-1α. Additionally, the elevated expression of AGR2 induced by hypoxia in bronchial epithelial cells likely depends on an XBP-1-associated pathway.

Abstract: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the common lethal urologic tumors. Recent studies revealed that SIRT1 might function as a tumor suppressor during the progression of RCC. In addition, studies showed that FGB expression was abnormally upregulated in RCC and related to the progress of RCC. This study aimed to define the function of SIRT1 and underlying mechanism in the RCC progression. The expression of SIRT1 and FGB in RCC specimens and cells were detected by immunoblotting and immunostaining. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm FGB as the target gene of STAT3. Other methods including stable transfection, co-immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and in vitro and in vivo proliferation assays were also performed. Our results showed that SIRT1 expression was downregulated in RCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and relatively high expression of SIRT1 conferred a better prognosis for patients. Next, we showed that SIRT1 overexpression inhibited RCC tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, FGB expression was upregulated in RCC tissues and overexpressing SIRT1 reduced FGB expression levels. Furthermore, inhibition of RCC proliferation by SIRT1 overexpression was rescued by FGB overexpression, indicating that SIRT1 inhibited RCC proliferation by repressing FGB expression. Mechanistically, we confirmed that FGB was the target gene of STAT3, and SIRT1 repressed the expression of FGB by deacetylation of STAT3, leading to STAT3 destabilization and degradation. SIRT1 inhibited RCC tumorigenesis by downregulating FGB expression, and this novel SIRT1-STAT3-FGB axis provided a potential target for RCC therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Commensal fungi of the mammalian skin, such as those of the genus Malassezia, are associated with atopic dermatitis and other common inflammatory skin disorders. Understanding of the causative relationship between fungal commensalism and disease manifestation remains incomplete. By developing a murine epicutaneous infection model, we found Malassezia spp. selectively induce IL-17 and related cytokines. This response is key in preventing fungal overgrowth on the skin, as disruption of the IL-23-IL-17 axis compromises Malassezia-specific cutaneous immunity. Under conditions of impaired skin integrity, mimicking a hallmark of atopic dermatitis, the presence of Malassezia dramatically aggravates cutaneous inflammation, which again was IL-23 and IL-17 dependent. Consistently, we found a CCR6+ Th17 subset of memory T cells to be Malassezia specific in both healthy individuals and atopic dermatitis patients, whereby the latter showed enhanced frequency of these cells. Thus, the Malassezia-induced type 17 response is pivotal in orchestrating antifungal immunity and in actively promoting skin inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) form the connection between the eye and the brain, with this connectivity disrupted in numerous blinding disorders. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability to derive RGCs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs); however, these cells exhibited some characteristics that indicated a limited state of maturation. Among the many factors known to influence RGC development in the retina, astrocytes are known to play a significant role in their functional maturation. Thus, efforts of the current study examined the functional maturation of hPSC-derived RGCs, including the ability of astrocytes to modulate this developmental timeline. Morphological and functional properties of RGCs were found to increase over time, with astrocytes significantly accelerating the functional maturation of hPSC-derived RGCs. The results of this study clearly demonstrate the functional and morphological maturation of RGCs in vitro, including the effects of astrocytes on the maturation of hPSC-derived RGCs.

Abstract: The strategy of using multipotential stem cells like bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) for nerve tissue engineering is proven feasible. The promotion effects on neural transdifferentiation of BMSCs from factors including nerve growth factor (NGF), laminin and electrical stimulation (ES) have been reported, while it is not known if these factors can achieve a strong synergetic impact when the cells are cultured on conductive substrates. In this study, it was identified that any single factor (NGF, laminin, or conductive substrate) combined with ES demonstrated the capacity to induce BMSCs transdifferentiating into neural cells, while the efficiency was found in the order of NGF > laminin > conductive substrate. The combination of any two of the factors would be more efficient in inducing the neural transdifferentiation than individual factor. As expected, the strongest promotion in inducing BMSCs to transdifferentiate into neural cells was identified when BMSCs were cultured on laminin-treated conductive nanofibrous mesh in the presence of NGF and under proper ES simultaneously, showing significant synergetic efficiency from these multiple factors. Studies on the Notch-1 signaling pathway, a main negative regulator of neurogenesis, revealed these factors sharing a similar molecular mechanism in regulating the neural transdifferentiation of BMSCs. The results suggested that satisfactory nerve regeneration might be achievable if these synergetic multiple factors could be involved in nerve guidance conduit design, especially, when BMSCs were applied as co-implanted cells.

Abstract: Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) plays a pivotal role in the development of organ fibrosis and can be induced by TGF-β. It is characterized by the loss of endothelial cell markers and the acquisition of mesenchymal markers. In this study, we found that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) was increased in TGF-β-induced EndMT, and silencing of MeCP2 inhibited EndMT induction. Viral overexpression of MeCP2 in vitro promoted EndMT and suppressed the expression of bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP7). The methylation of CpG islands in BMP7 promoter was increased in MeCP2-overexpressing endothelial cells and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed the direct binding of MeCP2 at the BMP7 promoter. In summary, our results suggest that MeCP2 promotes EndMT by epigenetically silencing BMP7 in endothelial cells and MeCP2 may be a target for diseases driven by EndMT.

Despite being a frequent cause of severe diarrheal disease in infants and an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, Cryptosporidium research has lagged due to a lack of facile experimental methods. Here, we describe a platform for complete life cycle development and long-term growth of C. parvum in vitro using “air-liquid interface” (ALI) cultures derived from intestinal epithelial stem cells. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that differentiating epithelial cells grown under ALI conditions undergo profound changes in metabolism and development that enable completion of the parasite life cycle in vitro. ALI cultures support parasite expansion > 100-fold and generate viable oocysts that are transmissible in vitro and to mice, causing infection and animal death. Transgenic parasite lines created using CRISPR/Cas9 were used to complete a genetic cross in vitro, demonstrating Mendelian segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. ALI culture provides an accessible model that will enable innovative studies into Cryptosporidium biology and host interactions.

Abstract: Pro-tumorigenic activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 have been linked to many cancers, but recently the tumour-suppressing role of MMP9 has also been elucidated. The multifaceted evidence on this subject prompted us to examine the role of MMP9 in the behaviour of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) cells. We used gelatinase-specific inhibitor, CTT2, and short hairpin (sh) RNA gene silencing to study the effects of MMP9 on proliferation, motility and invasion of an aggressive OTSCC cell line, HSC-3. We found that the migration and invasion of HSC-3 cells were increased by CTT2 and shRNA silencing of MMP9. Proliferation, in turn, was decreased by MMP9 inhibition. Furthermore, arresten-overexpressing HSC-3 cells expressed increased levels of MMP9, but exhibited decreased motility compared with controls. Interestingly, these cells restored their migratory capabilities by CTT2 inhibition of MMP9. Hence, although higher MMP9 expression could give rise to an increased tumour growth in vivo due to increased proliferation, in some circumstances, it may participate in yet unidentified molecular mechanisms that reduce the cell movement in OTSCC.

Abstract: Ozone (O3) is a major component of air pollution, which has been associated with airway inflammation characterized by the influx of neutrophils in asthmatic subjects. Canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) channel is recently identified as a target of oxidative stress which is involved in airway inflammation. However, the regulatory role of TRPC6 in airway epithelial cells and neutrophils has not yet been illuminated in detail. In this study, we investigated the role of TRPC6 in neutrophil adhesion to airway epithelial cells exposed to O3 in vivo and in vitro approaches. Using transgenic mice, the results showed that TRPC6-deficiency attenuated O3-induced neutrophil recruitment to airway epithelial cells and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. In vitro, O3 induced ICAM-1 expression and neutrophil adhesion to 16HBE cells (human airway epithelial cell line) and which were reduced by both TRPC6 silencing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and TRPC6 inhibitor Larixyl Acetate (LA). We also confirmed that TRPC6-dependent Ca2+ entry and NF-κB activation in 16HBE cells were required for ICAM-1-mediated neutrophil adhesion exposed to O3. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the contribution of TRPC6 to O3-induced neutrophil adhesion to airway epithelial cells via NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression, which may provide new potential concepts for preventing and treating air pollutant-related inflammatory lung diseases.

Abstract: Shear stress-activated cellular signalling is involved in cellular migration, proliferation and differentiation. However, it remains unclear about the effects of shear stress on the differentiation of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs). In this study, using a parallel plated flow chamber system, we found that low-shear stress loading (2 dyne/cm2) for 48 h could significantly inhibit the sphere-forming ability, increase the chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity, downregulate cancer stem cell marker expression and suppress the in vivo tumorigenicity potential of LCSCs. Moreover, using an atomic force microscope (AFM), we found that shear stress increased the Young's modulus of LCSCs. These results indicate LCSC's differentiation after shear stress exposure. In addition, low-shear stress loading suppressed the β-catenin expression in LCSCs. More importantly, pharmacological activation of Wnt/β-catenin signalling restored the shear stress-suppressed β-catenin expression in LCSCs, and abolished the shear stress-altered sphere-forming ability, chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity, cancer stem cell marker expression, Young's modulus and in vivo tumorigenicity potential of LCSCs. Our results suggest that low shear stress could induce LCSC differentiation via the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways, providing a new insight into the role of shear stress in cancer cell biological behaviors that might contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for liver cancer treatment.

Abstract: IκBα protein plays an important role in NFκB signaling pathway regulation. The dysfunction of IκBα is tightly related to various diseases, including cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms by which IκBα loses its normal functions are diverse and complex. Here, we reported a novel cleavage of IκBα protein occurred in AML cells. Compared with the full-length IκBα protein, the truncated IκBα fragment exhibited a dramatically weak binding ability to NFκB complex and showed a significant decreased inhibition on NFκB transactivation. Knockdown of PR3, a serine protease mainly expressed in myeloid cells, could inhibit such IκBα cleavage and enhance the sensitivities of AML cells to the differentiation inducers. In addition, we showed that the level of PR3 mRNA was relatively higher in newly diagnosed AML patients than in those patients with complete remission, suggesting that PR3 expression and its involvement in IκBα cleavage might be closely associated with AML. Our studies revealed for the first time a PR3-involved IκBα cleavage in AML cells, providing some new evidences for further understanding the mechanisms underlying the deregulation of NFκB pathway in AML. Finally, we also suggested a potential clinical application value of PR3 protein in the treatment and prognosis surveillance for leukemia.

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a diffuse pulmonary microvascular remodeling disease accompanied by malignant proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), which causes persistent pulmonary artery pressure elevation, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and death. However, current therapies targeting pulmonary vascular remodeling and RVH remain poorly effective in reversing PAH. Overactivation of the protein tyrosine kinase Src plays an important role in tumor cell growth, proliferation and invasion; we thus hypothesized that inhibitors targeting Src activation could reverse experimental PAH. We demonstrated that Src was markedly activated in hypoxia-stimulated PASMCs from donors and PASMCs isolated from PAH patients. We investigated the effects of the Src-selective inhibitor 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (PP1) and berberine (BBR) on PAH-PASMC proliferation and migration by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) and wound-healing assays. Our in vitro results showed that inhibition of Src (Tyr416) phosphorylation repressed PAH-PASMC proliferation and migration by inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) expression through Akt/mTOR signal pathway. In vivo, PP1 and BBR significantly alleviated distal pulmonary vascular remodeling and decreased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and RVH in Sugen (SU) 5416/hypoxia (SU-PAH) mice. These findings demonstrate that pharmacological (PP1 or BBR) inhibition of Src activation could be a novel means of treating severe pulmonary vascular remodeling and RVH in PAH patients.

Abstract: Understanding the individual timeline of stem cell differentiation in vivo is critical for evaluating stem cell properties in animal models. However, with conventional ex vivo techniques, such as histology, the individual timeline of differentiation is not accessible. Therefore, we designed lentiviral plasmids with cell-specific promoters to control the expression of bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging reporters. Promoter-dependent reporter expression in transduced human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) was an effective indicator of differentiation in cell culture. A 12-week in vivo imaging observation period revealed the time profile of differentiation of engrafted hNPCs in the mouse brain into astrocytes and mature neurons which was verified by immunostainings, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. The lentiviral vectors validated in this study provide an efficient imaging toolbox for non-invasive and longitudinal characterization of stem cell differentiation, in vitro screenings, and in vivo studies of cell therapy in animal models.

Abstract: Summary
Passive administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a promising therapeutic approach for Ebola virus disease (EVD). However, all mAbs and mAb cocktails that have entered clinical development are specific for a single member of the Ebolavirus genus, Ebola virus (EBOV), and ineffective against outbreak-causing Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) and Sudan virus (SUDV). Here, we advance MBP134, a cocktail of two broadly neutralizing human mAbs, ADI-15878 from an EVD survivor and ADI-23774 from the same survivor but specificity-matured for SUDV GP binding affinity, as a candidate pan-ebolavirus therapeutic. MBP134 potently neutralized all ebolaviruses and demonstrated greater protective efficacy than ADI-15878 alone in EBOV-challenged guinea pigs. A second-generation cocktail, MBP134AF, engineered to effectively harness natural killer (NK) cells afforded additional improvement relative to its precursor in protective efficacy against EBOV and SUDV in guinea pigs. MBP134AF is an optimized mAb cocktail suitable for evaluation as a pan-ebolavirus therapeutic in nonhuman primates.

Abstract: Guanine-rich RNA sequence binding factor 1 (GRSF1) is a member of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) family. GRSF1 regulates RNA metabolism through RNA processing, transport and translation in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. However, its role in myogenesis has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrated that the expression of mitochondrial GRSF1 was negatively related to the differentiation of mouse skeletal myoblasts. Interference with GRSF1 promotes myogenesis both in vitro and in vivo without affecting MyoD expression or cell proliferation. Further studies illustrated that GRSF1 regulated myogenic differentiation through direct targeting of mitochondrial GPX4, a key regulator of the cellular redox status, leading to the modulation of ROS levels, which is important for myogenesis. Our findings underscore a critical function for GRSF1 during skeletal myogenesis linked to its regulation of muscle redox homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Owing to immature immune systems and impaired colonization resistance mediated by the microbiota, infants are more susceptible to enteric infections. Maternal antibodies can provide immunity, with maternal vaccination offering a protective strategy. We find that oral infection of adult females with the enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium protects dams and offspring against oral challenge. Parenteral immunization of dams with heat-inactivated C. rodentium reduces pathogen loads and mortality in offspring but not mothers. IgG, but not IgA or IgM, transferred through breast milk to the intestinal lumen of suckling offspring, coats the pathogen and reduces intestinal colonization. Protective IgG largely recognizes virulence factors encoded within the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, including the adhesin Intimin and T3SS filament EspA, which are major antigens conferring protection. Thus, pathogen-specific IgG in breast milk induced during maternal infection or immunization protects neonates against infection with an attaching and effacing pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) CXCR4 is a co-receptor for HIV and is involved in cancers and autoimmune diseases. We characterized five purine or quinazoline core polyamine pharmacophores used for targeting CXCR4 dysregulation in diseases. All were neutral antagonists for wild-type CXCR4 and two were biased antagonists with effects on β-arrestin-2 only at high concentrations. These compounds displayed various activities for a constitutively active mutant (CAM). We use the IT1t-CXCR4 crystal structure and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop two hypotheses for the activation of the N1193.35A CAM. The N1193.35A mutation facilitates increased coupling of TM helices III and VI. IT1t deactivates the CAM by disrupting the coupling between TM helices III and VI, mediated primarily by residue F872.53. Mutants of F872.53 in N1193.35A CXCR4 precluded constitutive signaling and prevented inverse agonism. This work characterizes CXCR4 ligands and provides a mechanism for N1193.35A constitutive activation.

Abstract: Summary
Neonates are highly susceptible to infection with enteric pathogens, but the underlying mechanisms are not resolved. We show that neonatal chick colonization with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis requires a virulence-factor-dependent increase in epithelial oxygenation, which drives pathogen expansion by aerobic respiration. Co-infection experiments with an Escherichia coli strain carrying an oxygen-sensitive reporter suggest that S. Enteritidis competes with commensal Enterobacteriaceae for oxygen. A combination of Enterobacteriaceae and spore-forming bacteria, but not colonization with either community alone, confers colonization resistance against S. Enteritidis in neonatal chicks, phenocopying germ-free mice associated with adult chicken microbiota. Combining spore-forming bacteria with a probiotic E. coli isolate protects germ-free mice from pathogen colonization, but the protection is lost when the ability to respire oxygen under micro-aerophilic conditions is genetically ablated in E. coli. These results suggest that commensal Enterobacteriaceae contribute to colonization resistance by competing with S. Enteritidis for oxygen, a resource critical for pathogen expansion.

Abstract: Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein that can be secreted due to an imperfect KDEL motif. MANF plays a cytoprotective role in several soft tissues and is upregulated in conditions resulting from intracellular retention of mutant protein, including two skeletal diseases, metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, Schmid type (MCDS) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED). The role of MANF in skeletal tissue homeostasis is currently unknown. Interestingly, cartilage-specific deletion of Manf in a mouse model of MED resulted in increased disease severity, suggesting its upregulation may be chondroprotective. Treatment of MED chondrocytes with exogenous MANF led to a decrease in the cellular levels of BiP (GRP78), confirming MANF’s potential to modulate ER stress responses. However, it did not alleviate the intracellular retention of mutant matrilin-3, suggesting that it is the intracellular MANF that is of importance in the pathobiology of skeletal dysplasias. The Col2Cre-driven deletion of Manf from mouse cartilage resulted in a chondrodysplasia-like phenotype. Interestingly, ablation of MANF in cartilage did not have extracellular consequences but led to an upregulation of several ER-resident chaperones including BiP. This apparent induction of ER stress in turn led to dysregulated chondrocyte apoptosis and decreased proliferation, resulting in reduced long bone growth. We have previously shown that ER stress is an underlying disease mechanism for several skeletal dysplasias. The cartilage-specific deletion of Manf described in this study phenocopies our previously published chondrodysplasia models, further confirming that ER stress itself is sufficient to disrupt skeletal growth and thus represents a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Gliomas are lethal and aggressive form of brain tumors with resistance to conventional radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapies; inviting continuous efforts for drug discovery and drug delivery. Interestingly, small molecule hybrids are one such pharmacophore that continues to capture interest owing to their pluripotent medicinal effects. Accordingly, we earlier reported synthesis of potent Styryl-cinnamate hybrids (analogues of Salvianolic acid F) along with its plausible mode of action (MOA). We explored iTRAQ-LC/MS-MS technique to deduce differentially expressed landscape of native & phospho-proteins in treated glioma cells. Based on this, Protein-Protein Interactome (PPI) was looked into by employing computational tools and further validated in vitro. We hereby report that the Styryl-cinnamate hybrid, an analogue of natural Salvianolic acid F, alters key regulatory proteins involved in translation, cytoskeleton development, bioenergetics, DNA repair, angiogenesis and ubiquitination. Cell cycle analysis dictates arrest at G0/G1 stage along with reduced levels of cyclin D; involved in G1 progression. We discovered that Styryl-cinnamate hybrid targets glioma by intrinsically triggering metabolite-mediated stress. Various oncological circuits alleviated by the potential drug candidate strongly supports the role of such pharmacophores as anticancer drugs. Although, further analysis of SC hybrid in treating xenografts or solid tumors is yet to be explored but their candidature has gained huge impetus through this study. This study equips us better in understanding the shift in proteomic landscape after treating glioma cells with SC hybrid. It also allows us to elicit molecular targets of this potential drug before progressing to preclinical studies.

Abstract: Paclitaxel (Taxol) is an anticancer taxane drug commonly used in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, resistance to paclitaxel is a major difficulty in developing an effective therapy against NPC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to regulate genes that are involved in drug resistance. We assessed the effects of miR-29c, an miRNA identified in a genome-wide study of Taxol resistance, on genes associated with resistance in NPC cells. We established Taxol resistance in two human NPC cell lines, SUNE-1 and C666-1 (SUNE-1-Taxol and C666-1-Taxol) and found that miR-29c was downregulated and integrin beta-1 (ITGB1) was upregulated in Taxol-resistant NPC cells compared with parental NPC cells. Further investigations using a TUNEL assay and BAX/BCL-2 ratio, found that overexpression of miR-29c and knockdown of ITGB1 can resensitize drug-resistant NPC cells to Taxol and promote apoptosis. In addition, a dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that ITGB1 is the target of miR-29c. Furthermore, silencing miR-29c markedly increased Taxol-resistant NPC tumor growth in a nude mouse xenograft model while knockdown of ITGB1 reversed this result. Overall, these data demonstrate that miR-29c regulates resistance to Taxol in NPC by targeting ITGB1. Our research indicates that miR-29c may have potential use in Taxol-resistant NPC therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Glycolysis and hypoxia are key regulators of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) self-renewal, but how changes in metabolism affect gene expression is poorly understood. C-terminal binding proteins (CTBPs) are glycolytic sensors that through NADH binding link the metabolic state of the cell to its gene expression, by acting as transcriptional corepressors, or coactivators. However, the role of CTBPs in hESCs has not previously been investigated. A direct interaction between hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) and the CTBP proximal promoters in hESCs cultured only under hypoxia was demonstrated. Decreasing the rate of flux through glycolysis in hESCs maintained under hypoxia resulted in a reduction of CTBPs, OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, but also in the expression of HIF-2α. Silencing CTBP expression resulted in the loss of pluripotency marker expression demonstrating that CTBPs are involved in hESC maintenance. These data suggest that under hypoxia, glycolysis regulates self-renewal through HIF-2α and the induction of the metabolic sensors CTBPs.

Abstract: Cells express multiple biophysical cues during migration, differentiation, and transformation. Probing and quantifying these biophysical cues could serve as a diagnostic tool for differentiating healthy with neoplastic cells. These biophysical cues may be utilized for diagnostic screening in cancer, as the tumor cells interact with the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Stress and strain induced by the cancer cells and applied to the cancer cells have effects in cancer progression due to its influence in cell migration. It was reported that the introduction of compressive forces on cancerous cells triggers them to undergo apoptosis. In this report, we evaluated the effects of stretching forces on cancer cells by morphological analyses. We observed that cancer cells decrease their roundness (as determined by perimeter: area); increase their length and form filopodia in the initial stretching cycle. However, due to the increasing rigidity of the cells, they undergo apoptosis in later stretching cycles. These morphological changes were unique to breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells compared to the non-cancerous control. Elucidating and quantifying these morphological changes is potentially an early cancer diagnostic tool that may predict the propensity of the cancerous cells undergoing a metastatic transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) are regulatory RNAs >200 nt. We previously showed that lncRNA GAS5 decreases significantly in serum of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Hence, we sought to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of GAS5 in T2DM in adipose tissue. Using CHIP-RIP, we demonstrate that GAS5 binds to promoter of insulin receptor to regulate its expression, and its depletion inhibits glucose uptake and insulin signaling. Toward stabilizing GAS5 levels in T2DM, we incorporated a strategy to limit the degradation of GAS5 by blocking the interaction of GAS5 and UPF1 with a small molecule identified using OBTC screening strategy. NP-C86 binds to GAS5 with high affinity, and increases GAS5 levels and glucose uptake in diabetic patient adipocytes. As a broader impact, NP-C86 may be used as a molecular probe to investigate the intricacies of GAS5 in relevant biological systems as it offers specificity, efficient cellular uptake and is non-cytotoxic.

Abstract: Summary
Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are a backbone of multiple myeloma (MM) therapy. The proteasome harbors six proteolytically active subunits (β1, β2, β5), while β5 was identified as rate-limiting and is a primary target of clinically available PIs. The most effective pattern of subunit inhibition provided by these PIs for cytotoxic activity in MM is unknown. A head-to-head comparison of clinically available PIs shows that in the clinically relevant setting only the co-inhibition of β1 or β2 with β5 activity achieves meaningful functional proteasome inhibition and cytotoxicity, while the selective β2/β5 inhibition of both constitutive and immunoproteasome is the most cytotoxic. In the long-term setting, selective inhibition of β5 subunit is sufficient to induce cytotoxicity in PI-sensitive, but not in PI-resistant MM, and the β5/β2 co-inhibition is the most cytotoxic in PI-resistant MM. These results give a rational basis for selecting individual PIs for the treatment of MM.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian intestinal tract contains a complex microbial ecosystem with many lysogens, which are bacteria containing dormant phages (prophages) inserted within their genomes. Approximately half of intestinal viruses are derived from lysogens, suggesting that these bacteria encounter triggers that promote phage production. We show that prophages of the gut symbiont Lactobacillus reuteri are activated during gastrointestinal transit and that phage production is further increased in response to a fructose-enriched diet. Fructose and exposure to short-chain fatty acids activate the Ack pathway, involved in generating acetic acid, which in turn triggers the bacterial stress response that promotes phage production. L. reuteri mutants of the Ack pathway or RecA, a stress response component, exhibit decreased phage production. Thus, prophages in a gut symbiont can be induced by diet and metabolites affected by diet, which provides a potential mechanistic explanation for the effects of diet on the intestinal phage community.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of RNA-interacting pharmacophores could provide chemical probes and, potentially, small molecules for RNA-based therapeutics. Using a high-throughput differential scanning fluorimetry assay, we identified small-molecule natural products with the capacity to bind the discrete stem-looped structure of pre-miR-21. The most potent compound identified was a prodiginine-type compound, butylcycloheptyl prodiginine (bPGN), with the ability to inhibit Dicer-mediated processing of pre-miR-21 in vitro and in cells. Time-dependent RT-qPCR, western blot, and transcriptomic analyses showed modulation of miR-21 expression and its target genes such as PDCD4 and PTEN upon treatment with bPGN, supporting on-target inhibition. Consequently, inhibition of cellular proliferation in HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells was also observed when treated with bPGN. The discovery that bPGN can bind and modulate the expression of regulatory RNAs such as miR-21 helps set the stage for further development of this class of natural product as a molecular probe or therapeutic agent against miRNA-dependent diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa effectively colonizes host epithelia using pili as primary adhesins. Here we uncover a surface-specific asymmetric virulence program that enhances P. aeruginosa host colonization. We show that when P. aeruginosa encounters surfaces, the concentration of the second messenger c-di-GMP increases within a few seconds. This leads to surface adherence and virulence induction by stimulating pili assembly through activation of the c-di-GMP receptor FimW. Surface-attached bacteria divide asymmetrically to generate a piliated, surface-committed progeny (striker) and a flagellated, motile offspring that leaves the surface to colonize distant sites (spreader). Cell differentiation is driven by a phosphodiesterase that asymmetrically positions to the flagellated pole, thereby maintaining c-di-GMP levels low in the motile offspring. Infection experiments demonstrate that cellular asymmetry strongly boosts infection spread and tissue damage. Thus, P. aeruginosa promotes surface colonization and infection transmission through a cooperative virulence program that we termed Touch-Seed-and-Go.

Abstract: Summary
Deep learning is a significant step forward for developing autonomous tasks. One of its branches, computer vision, allows image recognition with high accuracy thanks to the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our goal was to train a CNN with transmitted light microscopy images to distinguish pluripotent stem cells from early differentiating cells. We induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells to epiblast-like cells and took images at several time points from the initial stimulus. We found that the networks can be trained to recognize undifferentiated cells from differentiating cells with an accuracy higher than 99%. Successful prediction started just 20 min after the onset of differentiation. Furthermore, CNNs displayed great performance in several similar pluripotent stem cell (PSC) settings, including mesoderm differentiation in human induced PSCs. Accurate cellular morphology recognition in a simple microscopic set up may have a significant impact on how cell assays are performed in the near future.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advances in generating three-dimensional (3D) organoid systems from stem cells offer new possibilities for disease modeling and drug screening because organoids can recapitulate aspects of in vivo architecture and physiology. In this study, we generate isogenic 3D midbrain organoids with or without a Parkinson's disease-associated LRRK2 G2019S mutation to study the pathogenic mechanisms associated with LRRK2 mutation. We demonstrate that these organoids can recapitulate the 3D pathological hallmarks observed in patients with LRRK2-associated sporadic Parkinson's disease. Importantly, analysis of the protein-protein interaction network in mutant organoids revealed that TXNIP, a thiol-oxidoreductase, is functionally important in the development of LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease in a 3D environment. These results provide proof of principle for the utility of 3D organoid-based modeling of sporadic Parkinson's disease in advancing therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are ideal candidates for cell-based therapies aimed at repairing spinal cord injury (SCI). Accurate targeting of OECs to the lesion site is critical to reconstructing the impaired nervous system. However, the key factors guiding the homing of transplanted OECs to the damaged area after SCI are still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) can significantly facilitate the homing of OECs after SCI in rats. First, we found that OECs exhibited a robust chemotaxis response to LPA in vitro, with LPAR1 being predominant receptor expressed on OECs. We further found that β-catenin signaling plays an important role in LPA-induced OEC migration. Moreover, silencing LPAR1 not only abolished the migration of OECs but also prevented ERK1/2 phosphorylation and β-catenin activation, suggesting that LPAR1 ligation serves to activate the ERK1/2 and β-catenin pathways in LPA-induced OEC chemotactic migration. Finally, cell transplantation experiments confirmed that endogenous LPA, which was observed to be produced at the lesion site after SCI in rat, is a key chemokine that facilitates OEC migration to the injury center. Collectively, our data provide a further description of the homing effects of LPA and a mechanism by which transplanted OECs migrate to the injured area after SCI in rats.

Abstract: Summary
Reappraisal of neuropathological studies suggests that pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (PD) spread progressively along predictable neuronal pathways in the human brain through unknown mechanisms. Although there is much evidence supporting the prion-like propagation and amplification of α-synuclein (α-Syn) in vitro and in rodent models, whether this scenario occurs in the human brain remains to be substantiated. Here we reconstructed in microfluidic devices corticocortical neuronal networks using human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a healthy donor. We provide unique experimental evidence that different strains of human α-Syn disseminate in “wild-type” human neuronal networks in a prion-like manner. We show that two distinct α-Syn strains we named fibrils and ribbons are transported, traffic between neurons, and trigger to different extents, in a dose- and structure-dependent manner, the progressive accumulation of PD-like pathological hallmarks. We further demonstrate that seeded aggregation of endogenous soluble α-Syn affects synaptic integrity and mitochondria morphology.

Abstract: In retinoblastoma research tumor-derived cell lines remain an important model to investigate tumorigenesis and new therapy options, due to limited tumor material and lack of adequate animal models. A panel of 10 retinoblastoma cell lines was characterized with respect to mutation, methylation and expression of RB1 and MYCN. These established retinoblastoma cell lines represent the most frequent types of RB1 inactivation and together with the MYCN amplification status, three classes can be distinguished: RB1mut/MYCNnonA, RB1mut/MYCNA and RB1wt/MYCNA. MYCN amplification was identified in five cell lines, whereby two of them, RB522 and RB3823, harbor no aberration in RB1. Targeted sequencing of 160 genes often mutated in cancer identified only few variants in tumor-associated genes other than in RB1. None of these variants was recurrent. mRNA expression analyses of retinal markers, cell cycle regulators and members of the TP53 signaling pathway revealed a high variability between cell lines but no class-specific differences. The here presented thorough validation of retinoblastoma cell lines, including microsatellite analysis for cell line authentication, provides the basis for further in vitro studies on retinoblastoma.

Antagonism of BMP signaling is insufficient to induce fibrous differentiation in primary sclerotome,

Abstract: Sclerotome is the embryonic progenitor of the axial skeleton. It was previously shown that Tgfbr2 is required in sclerotome for differentiation of fibrous skeletal tissues including the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc. Alternatively, BMP signaling is required to form the vertebral body through chondrogenesis. In addition, TGFβ added to sclerotome cultures induces expression of markers for fibrous tissue differentiation but not cartilage or bone. The mechanism of how TGFβ signaling regulates this lineage decision in sclerotome is not known and could be due to the production of instructive or inhibitory signals or a combination of the two. Here we show that TGFβ antagonizes BMP/ Smad1/5 signaling in primary sclerotome likely through regulation of Noggin, an extracellular BMP antagonist, to prevent chondrogenesis. We then tested whether inhibition of BMP signaling, and inhibition of chondrogenesis, is sufficient to push cells toward the fibrous cell fate. While Noggin inhibited BMP/ Smad1/5 signaling and the formation of chondrogenic nodules in sclerotome cultures; Noggin and inhibition of BMP signaling through Gremlin or DMH2 were insufficient to induce fibrous tissue differentiation. The results suggest inhibition of BMP signaling is not sufficient to stimulate fibrous tissue differentiation and additional signals are likely required. We propose that TGFβ has a dual role in regulating sclerotome fate. First, it inhibits BMP signaling potentially through Noggin to prevent chondrogenesis and, second, it provides an unknown instructive signal to promote fibrous tissue differentiation in sclerotome. The results have implications for the design of stem cell-based therapies for skeletal diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Current models propose that reductions in the number of lymphoid-biased hematopoietic stem cells (Ly-HSCs) underlie age-related declines in lymphopoiesis. We show that Ly-HSCs do not decline in number with age. Old Ly-HSCs exhibit changes in gene expression and a myeloid-biased genetic profile, but we demonstrate that they retain normal lymphoid potential when removed from the old in vivo environment. Additional studies showing that interleukin-1 inhibits Ly-HSC lymphoid potential provide support for the hypothesis that increased production of inflammatory cytokines during aging underlies declines in lymphocyte production. These results indicate that current models proposing that lymphopoiesis declines with age due to loss of Ly-HSCs require revision and provide an additional perspective on why lymphocyte development in the elderly is attenuated.

Abstract: The channel-forming membrane glycoprotein pannexin 1 (Panx1) is best characterized as an ATP release channel. To investigate the trafficking and sorting of Panx1, we used polarized MDCK cells and non-polarized BICR-M1Rk cells to track the fate of GFP-tagged Panx1. In non-polarized cells, Panx1 was found throughout the plasma membrane, including the lamellipodia of the tumor cells and the cell surface-targeting domain was mapped to residues 307–379. Panx1 was preferentially enriched at the apical membrane domain of polarized MDCK cells grown as monolayer sheets or as spheroids. Residual Panx1 localized within basolateral membranes of polarized MDCK cells was independent of a putative dileucine sorting motif LL365/6 found within the C-terminal of Panx1. Unexpectedly, stable expression of a Panx1 mutant, where a putative tyrosine-based basolateral sorting motif (YxxØ) was mutated (Y308F), or a truncated Δ379 Panx1 mutant, caused MDCK cells to lose cell-cell contacts and their ability to polarize as they underwent a switch to a more fibroblast-like phenotype. We conclude that Panx1 is preferentially delivered to the apical domain of polarized epithelial cells, and Panx1 mutants drive phenotypic changes to MDCK cells preventing their polarization.

Abstract: Desmocollin 3 (DSC3) is a transmembrane adhesion protein of desmosomes and involved in carcinogenesis in various cancer types. Downregulation of DSC3 has been reported in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the function of DSC3 in CRC has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we performed cell-based functional analysis after DSC3 overexpression by stable transfection and knockdown by siRNA in CRC cells. It turned out that overexpression of DSC3 reduced cell proliferation, colony forming ability, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis. Further pathway analysis showed that overexpression of DSC3 significantly inhibited the activity of AKT pathway and increased the expression of E-cadherin as well as p53 and p21. In contrast, siRNA-mediated knockdown of DSC3 increased cell proliferation and colony formation, activated the AKT pathway and decreased the expression of E-cadherin as well as p53 and p21. Additionally, in primary CRC patient samples, the expression of DSC3 protein was significantly related to the expression of desmocollin 1 (DSC1) and desmocollin 2 (DSC2) as well as E-cadherin (p < 0.001 respectively). Taken together, our data reveal that DSC3 suppresses CRC cell growth through inhibition of AKT pathway and regulation of E-cadherin. DSC3 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for CRC.

Abstract: Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), a member of the alkaline-leucine zipper family, is widely expressed in various tissues, and reportedly involved in inflammatory responses to various irritates, but its role in the central nervous system (CNS) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression and biological function of ATF2 in CNS inflammation. Utilizing the LPS-induced neuroinflammation model on mice, we first found ATF2 up-regulation and its co-localization with microglia in inflamed mice brain. In vitro, we revealed an increased expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear accumulation of ATF2 in LPS-treated BV2 microglia cells. Inhibiting ATF2 significantly decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors in LPS-treated microglia, and alleviated neuronal apoptosis induced by the conditioned medium of activated microglia. Knocking down TRAF6, an important adaptor of the TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, suppressed the LPS-induced ATF2 expression and phosphorylation, accompanied by the decreased p38/JNK phosphorylation, in microglia. Blocking p38 or JNK signaling pathway by the specific inhibitors reversed the TRAF6-overexpression mediated ATF2 activation. Taken together, our data first proved the pro-inflammatory function of ATF2 in microglia, and suggested that the TRAF6-JNK/p38-ATF2 axis might promote microglial inflammatory activation and thus aggravate neuronal injury in brain, which might become a potential therapeutic target for CNS diseases.

Abstract: Zinc-figure protein 217 (ZNF217) is a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor that works as a pivotal effector stimulating embryonic immortalization as well as oncogenicity during multiple cancer processes. Nevertheless, the expression of ZNF217 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the underlying specific molecular mechanisms remains elusive. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential role of ZNF217 in HCC cell proliferation and invasion, as well as the underlying mechanism. Here, we demonstrated that the expression of ZNF217 was higher in HCC patients and indicated worse overall survival times, which was confirmed by Oncomine datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HCC cohorts. Further research discovered that knockdown of ZNF217 inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Enforced expression of ZNF217 could promote Epithelial-mesenchymal transition and thus the invasion of HCC cells. Mechanistically, we identified ZNF217 interacted with LSD1 in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of ZNF217 was accompanied by a parallel increase in di-methyl histone 3 lysine4 levels on CDH1 promoter, which indicated ZNF217 could recruit LSD1 to affect CDH1 epigenetic expression from transcription level. Of note, bioinformatics analyses, a dual luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis demonstrated that microRNA-101 (miR-101), a well-known tumor suppressor in HCC, acted as a negative regulator of ZNF217. The inhibition of HCC progression by miR-101 was counteracted by ZNF217 overexpression. Taken together, our study presents the regulation mechanism of miR-101/ZNF217/CDH1 axis for the first time and provides new evidences of ZNF217 as a potential therapeutic target for HCC patients.

Abstract: Summary
The most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an expanded G4C2 repeat [(G4C2)exp] in C9ORF72. ALS/FTD-associated toxicity has been traced to the RNA transcribed from the repeat expansion [r(G4C2)exp], which sequesters RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and undergoes repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation to generate toxic dipeptide repeats. Using in vitro and cell-based assays, we identified a small molecule (4) that selectively bound r(G4C2)exp, prevented sequestration of an RBP, and inhibited RAN translation. Indeed, biophysical characterization showed that 4 selectively bound the hairpin form of r(G4C2)exp, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies and molecular dynamics simulations defined this molecular recognition event. Cellular imaging revealed that 4 localized to r(G4C2)exp cytoplasmic foci, the putative sites of RAN translation. Collectively, these studies highlight that the hairpin structure of r(G4C2)exp is a therapeutically relevant target and small molecules that bind it can ameliorate c9ALS/FTD-associated toxicity.

Abstract: Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are essential for small G proteins to activate their downstream signaling pathways, which are involved in morphogenesis, cell adhesion, and migration. Mutants of Gef26, a PDZ-GEF (PDZ domain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor) in Drosophila, exhibit strong defects in wings, eyes, and the reproductive and nervous systems. However, the precise roles of Gef26 in development remain unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the role of Gef26 in synaptic development and function. We identified significant decreases in bouton number and branch length at larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in Gef26 mutants, and these defects were fully rescued by restoring Gef26 expression, indicating that Gef26 plays an important role in NMJ morphogenesis. In addition to the observed defects in NMJ morphology, electrophysiological analyses revealed functional defects at NMJs, and locomotor deficiency appeared in Gef26 mutant larvae. Furthermore, Gef26 regulated NMJ morphogenesis by regulating the level of synaptic Fasciclin II (FasII), a well-studied cell adhesion molecule that functions in NMJ development and remodeling. Finally, our data demonstrate that Gef26-specific small G protein Rap1 worked downstream of Gef26 to regulate the level of FasII at NMJs, possibly through a βPS integrin-mediated signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings define a novel role of Gef26 in regulating NMJ development and function.

Abstract: Renal cell carcinomas are a group of most common renal malignancies whose clinical intervention is complicated by the lack of early diagnosis and reliable prognosis biomarkers, insensitive radiotherapy and chemotherapy and expensive molecular-targeted drugs. Transcriptional coactivator TAZ has been implicated in the formation and development of various malignancies. However, the biological characteristics and function of TAZ in renal cell carcinoma are still unclear. We attempted to evaluate the potential of TAZ as a promising diagnostic and prognostic molecular marker for renal cell carcinoma. In our study, we confirmed that TAZ was frequently elevated in renal cancer tissues and cells, consistent with the results of the publicly available cancer database. Moreover, elevated TAZ expression was positively correlated with poor overall survival time, high Fuhrman grade and distant metastasis. Our receiver operating characteristic curves analysis showed that high TAZ expression could distinguish renal cancer patients from normal persons (p < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that high TAZ expression predicted poor overall survival (p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that TAZ expression could be an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.002) in patients with renal cancer. Finally, the functional roles of TAZ knockdown were examined in renal cancer cell lines and nude mice subcutaneous tumor models. In conclusion, our results suggest that TAZ may serve as a promising diagnostic and prognostic molecular marker for patients with renal cancer. Moreover, TAZ may represent a novel clinical therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Physical activity is a strong positive physiological modulator of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Although the underlying regulatory mechanisms are still unknown, systemic processes must be involved. Here we show that platelets are activated after acute periods of running, and that activated platelets promote neurogenesis, an effect that is likely mediated by platelet factor 4. Ex vivo, the beneficial effects of activated platelets and platelet factor 4 on neural precursor cells were dentate gyrus specific and not observed in the subventricular zone. Moreover, the depletion of circulating platelets in mice abolished the running-induced increase in precursor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus following exercise. These findings demonstrate that platelets and their released factors can modulate adult neural precursor cells under physiological conditions and provide an intriguing link between running-induced platelet activation and the modulation of neurogenesis after exercise.

Abstract: Summary
Cryopreservation has a negative effect on the quality of oocytes and may be closely associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptotic events. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the detrimental effects on the developmental competence of somatic cell nuclear transferred (SCNT) mouse embryos using vitrified (cryopreserved) oocytes and to evaluate the recovery effects of melatonin on cryo-damage in cloned embryos. Development of SCNT embryos using cryopreserved oocyte cytoplasm (SCNT-CROC) was inferior to those using fresh cytoplasm (SCNT-FOC). Using RNA-sequencing analysis, we found upregulation of eight pro-apoptotic-related genes (Cyct, Dapk2, Dffb, Gadd45g, Hint2, Mien1, P2rx7, and Pmaip) in the SCNT-CROC group. Furthermore, the addition of melatonin, an agent that reduces apoptosis and ROS production, enhanced blastocyst formation rates in the SCNT-CROP group when compared with the melatonin-untreated group. Additionally, melatonin treatment increased the derivation efficiency of pluripotent stem cells from cloned embryos using cryopreserved oocyte.

Abstract: Apoptosis of epithelial cells is regarded as the initial pathological process of many lung diseases, including asthma. Previous studies have identified that galectin-7 (Gal-7), a regulator of apoptosis, was overexpressed in bronchial epithelial cells in asthma. However, the effect and mechanism of Gal-7 in the progression of asthma is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression and role of Gal-7 in the apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B upon TGF-β1 stimulation. TGF-β1 significantly induced apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells, as determined by flow cytometry. Western blot results revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of Gal-7 were obviously increased after TGF-β1 stimulation. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Gal-7 abrogated TGF-β1-evoked cell apoptosis. Simultaneously, increased Bcl-2 expression, decreased Bax expression and the cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 activity were also monitored in TGF-β1-treated cells after Gal-7 siRNA transfection. Gal-7 silence also inhibited TGF-β1-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells. Furthermore, anisomycin, a specific activator for JNK, reversed the effect of Gal-7 siRNA on cell apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. These results demonstrate that Gal-7 silence attenuates TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in bronchial epithelial cells through the inactivation of JNK pathway. Therefore, Gal-7 may act as a potential target for asthma treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-specific stem cells have unique properties and growth requirements, but a small set of juxtacrine and paracrine signals have been identified that are required across multiple niches. Whereas insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is necessary for prenatal growth, its role in adult stem cell physiology is largely unknown. We show that loss of Igf2 in adult mice resulted in a ∼50% reduction in slowly dividing, label-retaining cells in the two regions of the brain that harbor neural stem cells. Concordantly, induced Igf2 deletion increased newly generated neurons in the olfactory bulb accompanied by hyposmia, and caused impairments in learning and memory and increased anxiety. Induced Igf2 deletion also resulted in rapid loss of stem and progenitor cells in the crypts of Lieberkühn, leading to body-weight loss and lethality and the inability to produce organoids in vitro. These data demonstrate that IGF-II is critical for multiple adult stem cell niches.

Abstract: Repeat destabilisation is variously associated with human disease. In neoplastic diseases, microsatellite instability (MSI) has been regarded as simply reflecting DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. However, several discrepancies have been pointed out. Firstly, the MSI+ phenotype is not uniform in human neoplasms. Established classification utilises the frequency of microsatellite changes, i.e. MSI-H (high) and -L (low), the former regarded as an authentic MMR-defective phenotype. In addition, we have observed the qualitatively distinct modes of MSI, i.e. Type A and Type B. One discrepancy we previously pointed out is that tumours occurring in MMR gene knockout mice exhibited not drastic microsatellite changes typical in MSI-H tumours (i.e. Type B mode) but minor and more subtle alterations (i.e. Type A mode). In the present study, MSH2 mutations reported in Lynch syndrome (LS) kindred have been introduced into HeLa cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The established mutant clones clearly exhibited MMR-defective phenotypes with alkylating agent-tolerance and elevated mutation frequencies. Nevertheless, microsatellites were not markedly destabilised as in MSI-H tumours occurring in LS patients, and all the observed alterations were uniformly Type A, which confirms the results in mice. Our findings suggest added complexities to the molecular mechanisms underlying repeat destabilisation in human genome.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as a major intercellular communication system engaged in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) are a subset of EVs of special interest as potential cancer biomarkers. Supernatants of tumor cell lines are widely used as the source of pure TEX for molecular/genetic studies. To optimize TEX isolation and characterization for these studies, we evaluated culture conditions for different tumor cell lines and used mini size exclusion chromatography (mini-SEC) for TEX isolation. Each tumor cell line showed unique culture requirements that determined the recovery, purity and total yield of TEX. Culture conditions for optimal TEX purity and recovery by mini-SEC could be modified by altering the media composition and numbers of seeded cells. TEX recovered from mini-SEC fraction #4 under optimized conditions were biologically active, were sized from 30 to 150 nm in diameter, had a typical vesicular morphology and carried endocytic markers. The most critical requirement for reproducible exosome recovery was re-seeding of tumor cells in numbers adjusted to reflect the optimized culture conditions for each tumor cell line. This study provides insights into a cell culture technique, which can be optimized for exosome production by various human or mouse tumor cell lines for isolation by mini-SEC.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza is a leading cause of death in the elderly, and the vaccine protects only a fraction of this population. A key aspect of antibody-mediated anti-influenza virus immunity is adaptation to antigenically distinct epitopes on emerging strains. We examined factors contributing to reduced influenza vaccine efficacy in the elderly and uncovered a dramatic reduction in the accumulation of de novo immunoglobulin gene somatic mutations upon vaccination. This reduction is associated with a significant decrease in the capacity of antibodies to target the viral glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), and critical protective epitopes surrounding the HA receptor-binding domain. Immune escape by antigenic drift, in which viruses generate mutations in key antigenic epitopes, becomes highly exaggerated. Because of this reduced adaptability, most B cells activated in the elderly cohort target highly conserved but less potent epitopes. Given these findings, vaccines driving immunoglobulin gene somatic hypermutation should be a priority to protect elderly individuals.

Abstract: Herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) is an excellent ornamental plant, which is usually stressed by summer high temperatures, but little is known about its relevant measures. In this study, the effects of trehalose on alleviating high temperature-induced damage in P. lactiflora were examined. High temperature stress in P. lactiflora increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide anion free radical (O2·−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), enhanced both malondialdehyde (MDA) content and relative electrical conductivity (REC), decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, increased catalase (CAT) activity, inhibited photosynthesis, and destroyed cell structure. However, exogenous trehalose effectively alleviated its high temperature-induced damage. Trehalose decreased O2·− and H2O2 accumulation, MDA content, and REC, increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, enhanced photosynthesis, improved cell structure, and made chloroplasts rounder. Additionally, trehalose induced high temperature-tolerant-related gene expressions to different degrees. These results indicated that trehalose decreased the deleterious effect of high temperature stress on P. lactiflora growth by enhancing antioxidant systems, activating photosynthesis, and protecting cell structure. These findings indicate the potential application of trehalose for managing high temperatures in P. lactiflora cultivation.

Abstract: Summary
Genetically encoded biosensors are useful tools for detecting the presence and levels of diverse biomolecules in living cells. However, low-abundance targets are difficult to detect because they are often unable to bind and activate enough biosensors to detect using standard microscopic imaging approaches. Here we describe a type of RNA-based biosensor, an RNA integrator, which enables detection of low-abundance targets in vitro and in living cells. The RNA integrator is an RNA sequence comprising a ribozyme and an unfolded form of the fluorogenic aptamer Broccoli. Upon binding its target, the ribozyme undergoes cleavage and releases Broccoli, which subsequently folds and becomes fluorescent. Importantly, each target molecule can bind and induce cleavage of multiple copies of the integrator sensor, resulting in an amplified signal. We show that this approach can be generalized to numerous different ribozyme types for the detection of various small molecules.

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is featured by erosive cartilage and bone destruction. The enhancing aggressive property of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) plays a critical role in this process. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins, including SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3 and SUMO-4, participate in regulating many cellular events such as survival, migration and signal transduction in some cell lines. However, their roles in the pathogenesis of RA are not well established. Therefore, we evaluated the role of SUMO proteins in RA FLSs migration and invasion. We found that expression of both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 was elevated in FLSs and synovial tissues (STs) from patients with RA. SUMO-1 suppression by small interference RNA (siRNA) reduced migration and invasion as well as MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression in RA FLSs. We also demonstrated that SUMO-1 regulated lamellipodium formation during cell migration. To explore further into molecular mechanisms, we evaluated the effect of SUMO-1 knockdown on the activation of Rac1/PAK1, a critical signaling pathway that controls cell motility. Our results indicated that SUMO-1-mediated SUMOylation controlled Rac1 activation and modulated downstream PAK1 activity. Inhibition of Rac1 or PAK1 also decreased migration and invasion of RA FLSs. Our findings suggest that SUMO-1 suppression could be protective against joint destruction in RA by inhibiting aggressive behavior of RA FLSs.

Abstract: Stress-activated and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulate gene expression by post-translational modifications of transcription factors. Elk-1, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of immediate early genes, is amenable to regulation by all the three mammalian MAPKs. In the present report, using inhibitors specific for different MAPK pathways, we show that during exposure of HeLa cells to heat stress, Elk-1 is SUMOylated with SUMO1 by p38 MAPK pathway-dependent mechanisms. Elk-1-phosphorylation levels were significantly reduced under similar conditions. We also show that transcriptional activity of Elk-1 as assessed by luciferase reporter expression and qPCR estimation of the expression of genes regulated by Elk-1 was downregulated upon exposure to heat stress; this downregulation was reversed when heat exposure was performed in the presence of either SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) or ginkgolic acid (inhibitor of SUMOylation). Elk-1 induced transcription is also regulated by PIAS2 which acts as a coactivator upon the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and as a corepressor upon its phosphorylation by p38 MAPK. Since heat stress activates the p38 MAPK pathway, we determined if PIAS2 was phosphorylated in heat-stressed HeLa cells. Our studies indicate that in HeLa cells exposed to heat stress, PIAS2 is phosphorylated by p38 MAPK pathway-dependent mechanisms. Collectively, the results presented demonstrate that in heat-stressed HeLa cells, p38 MAPK pathway-dependent SUMOylation of Elk-1 and phosphorylation of PIAS2 correlate with the downregulation of transactivation by Elk-1.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid-differentiated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have contributed to a number of novel treatment approaches for lysosomal storage diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), and may also be applied to patients infected with HIV. We quantified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) trafficking to 20 tissues including lymph nodes, spleen, liver, gastrointestinal tract, CNS, and reproductive tissues. We observed efficient marking of multiple macrophage subsets, including CNS-associated myeloid cells, suggesting that HSPC-derived macrophages are a viable approach to target gene-modified cells to tissues. Gene-marked cells in the CNS were unique from gene-marked cells at any other physiological sites including peripheral blood. This novel finding suggests that these cells were derived from HSPCs, migrated to the brain, were compartmentalized, established myeloid progeny, and could be targeted for lifelong delivery of therapeutic molecules. Our findings have highly relevant implications for the development of novel therapies for genetic and infectious diseases of the CNS.

Abstract: Summary
The proper staining of the plasma membrane (PM) is critical in bioimaging as it delimits the cell. Herein, we developed MemBright, a family of six cyanine-based fluorescent turn-on PM probes that emit from orange to near infrared when reaching the PM, and enable homogeneous and selective PM staining with excellent contrast in mono- and two-photon microscopy. These probes are compatible with long-term live-cell imaging and immunostaining. Moreover, MemBright label neurons in a brighter manner than surrounding cells, allowing identification of neurons in acute brain tissue sections and neuromuscular junctions without any use of transfection or transgenic animals. In addition, MemBright probes were used in super-resolution imaging to unravel the neck of dendritic spines. 3D multicolor dSTORM in combination with immunostaining revealed en-passant synapse displaying endogenous glutamate receptors clustered at the axonal-dendritic contact site. MemBright probes thus constitute a universal toolkit for cell biology and neuroscience biomembrane imaging with a variety of microscopy techniques.

Abstract: Glucoside xylosyltransferase2 (GXYLT2), a member of the human α-1,3-D-xylosyltransferases, functions to modify the first xylose to the O-Glucose residue on epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats of Notch receptors. It is well-established that the Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in proper development and homeostasis. However, the regulatory role of EGF xylosylation in Notch signaling and different cell activities in human cells remains unknown. In this study, we showed that knockdown of GXYLT2 suppressed human cell proliferation and induced G1/S phase cell cycle arrest. GXYLT2 downregulation also inhibited cell migration and invasion, whereas the overexpression of GXYLT2 had the opposite effects. Additionally, GXYLT2 activated Notch signaling and promoted the phosphorylation of MAPKs but not PI3K and Akt. Taken together, our findings indicated that GXYLT2 plays an important role in cell activities via regulation of the Notch signaling.

Abstract: Summary
In type 1 diabetes, a renewable source of human pancreatic β cells, in particular from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) origin, would greatly benefit cell therapy. Earlier work showed that pancreatic progenitors differentiated from human embryonic stem cells in vitro can further mature to become glucose responsive following macroencapsulation and transplantation in mice. Here we took a similar approach optimizing the generation of pancreatic progenitors from hiPSCs. This work demonstrates that hiPSCs differentiated to pancreatic endoderm in vitro can be efficiently and robustly generated under large-scale conditions. The hiPSC-derived pancreatic endoderm cells (HiPECs) can further differentiate into glucose-responsive islet-like cells following macroencapsulation and in vivo implantation. The HiPECs can protect mice from streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia and maintain normal glucose homeostasis and equilibrated plasma glucose concentrations at levels similar to the human set point. These results further validate the potential use of hiPSC-derived islet cells for application in clinical settings.
