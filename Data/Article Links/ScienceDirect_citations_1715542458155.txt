Abstract: Summary
Osteoporosis is the most prevalent metabolic bone disease, characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration. Here, we show that warmth exposure (34°C) protects against ovariectomy-induced bone loss by increasing trabecular bone volume, connectivity density, and thickness, leading to improved biomechanical bone strength in adult female, as well as in young male mice. Transplantation of the warm-adapted microbiota phenocopies the warmth-induced bone effects. Both warmth and warm microbiota transplantation revert the ovariectomy-induced transcriptomics changes of the tibia and increase periosteal bone formation. Combinatorial metagenomics/metabolomics analysis shows that warmth enhances bacterial polyamine biosynthesis, resulting in higher total polyamine levels in vivo. Spermine and spermidine supplementation increases bone strength, while inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis in vivo limits the beneficial warmth effects on the bone. Our data suggest warmth exposure as a potential treatment option for osteoporosis while providing a mechanistic framework for its benefits in bone disease.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the functional diversity of synapses requires a high-resolution, sensitive, diffusion-free, quantitative localization method that allows the determination of many proteins in functionally characterized individual synapses. Array tomography permits the quantitative analysis of single synapses but has limited sensitivity, and its application to functionally characterized synapses is challenging. Here, we aim to overcome these limitations by searching the parameter space of different fixation, resin, embedding, etching, retrieval, and elution conditions. Our optimizations reveal that etching epoxy-resin-embedded ultrathin sections with Na-ethanolate and treating them with SDS dramatically increase the labeling efficiency of synaptic proteins. We also demonstrate that this method is ideal for the molecular characterization of individual synapses following paired recordings, two-photon [Ca2+] or glutamate-sensor (iGluSnFR) imaging. This method fills a missing gap in the toolbox of molecular and cellular neuroscience, helping us to reveal how molecular heterogeneity leads to diversity in function.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is characterized by adipose tissue inflammation. Because proteoglycans regulate inflammation, here we investigate their role in adipose tissue inflammation in obesity. We find that adipose tissue versican and biglycan increase in obesity. Versican is produced mainly by adipocytes and biglycan by adipose tissue macrophages. Both proteoglycans are also present in adipose tissue from obese human subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Deletion of adipocyte-specific versican or macrophage-specific biglycan in mice reduces macrophage accumulation and chemokine and cytokine expression, although only adipocyte-specific versican deletion leads to sustained improvement in glucose tolerance. Macrophage-derived biglycan activates inflammatory genes in adipocytes. Versican expression increases in cultured adipocytes exposed to excess glucose, and adipocyte-conditioned medium stimulates inflammation in resident peritoneal macrophages, in part because of a versican breakdown product, versikine. These findings provide insights into the role of adipocyte- and macrophage-derived proteoglycans in adipose tissue inflammation in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian precerebellar pontine nucleus (PN) has a main role in relaying cortical information to the cerebellum. The molecular determinants establishing ordered connectivity patterns between cortical afferents and precerebellar neurons are largely unknown. We show that expression of Hox5 transcription factors is induced in specific subsets of postmitotic PN neurons at migration onset. Hox5 induction is achieved by response to retinoic acid signaling, resulting in Jmjd3-dependent derepression of Polycomb chromatin and 3D conformational changes. Hoxa5 drives neurons to settle posteriorly in the PN, where they are monosynaptically targeted by cortical neuron subsets mainly carrying limb somatosensation. Furthermore, Hoxa5 postmigratory ectopic expression in PN neurons is sufficient to attract cortical somatosensory inputs regardless of position and avoid visual afferents. Transcriptome analysis further suggests that Hoxa5 is involved in circuit formation. Thus, Hoxa5 coordinates postmitotic specification, migration, settling position, and sub-circuit assembly of PN neuron subsets in the cortico-cerebellar pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM), a mostly lethal brain tumor, acquires large amounts of free fatty acids (FAs) to promote cell growth. But how the cancer avoids lipotoxicity is unknown. Here, we identify that GBM upregulates diacylglycerol-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) to store excess FAs into triglycerides and lipid droplets. Inhibiting DGAT1 disrupted lipid homeostasis and resulted in excessive FAs moving into mitochondria for oxidation, leading to the generation of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. Adding N-acetyl-cysteine or inhibiting FA shuttling into mitochondria decreased ROS and cell death induced by DGAT1 inhibition. We show in xenograft models that targeting DGAT1 blocked lipid droplet formation, induced tumor cell apoptosis, and markedly suppressed GBM growth. Together, our study demonstrates that DGAT1 upregulation protects GBM from oxidative damage and maintains lipid homeostasis by facilitating storage of excess FAs. Targeting DGAT1 could be a promising therapeutic approach for GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Some Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) strains harbor a prophage within the comK gene, which renders it inactive. During Lm infection of macrophage cells, the prophage turns into a molecular switch, promoting comK gene expression and therefore Lm intracellular growth. During this process, the prophage does not produce infective phages or cause bacterial lysis, suggesting it has acquired an adaptive behavior suited to the pathogenic lifestyle of its host. In this study, we demonstrate that this non-classical phage behavior, named active lysogeny, relies on a transcriptional response that is specific to the intracellular niche. While the prophage undergoes lytic induction, the process is arrested midway, preventing the transcription of the late genes. Further, we demonstrate key phage factors, such as LlgA transcription regulator and a DNA replicase, that support the phage adaptive behavior. This study provides molecular insights into the adaptation of phages to their pathogenic hosts, uncovering unusual cooperative interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the development of second-generation antiandrogens, acquired resistance to hormone therapy remains a major challenge in treating advanced prostate cancer. We find that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote antiandrogen resistance in mouse models and in prostate organoid cultures. We identify neuregulin 1 (NRG1) in CAF supernatant, which promotes resistance in tumor cells through activation of HER3. Pharmacological blockade of the NRG1/HER3 axis using clinical-grade blocking antibodies re-sensitizes tumors to hormone deprivation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with increased tumor NRG1 activity have an inferior response to second-generation antiandrogen therapy. This work reveals a paracrine mechanism of antiandrogen resistance in prostate cancer amenable to clinical testing using available targeted therapies.

Abstract: Scaffolds composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) can assist tissue remodeling and repair following injury. The ECM is a complex biomaterial composed of proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans, secreted by cells. The ECM contains fundamental biological cues that modulate cell behavior and serves as a structural scaffold for cell adhesion and growth. For clinical applications, where immune rejection is a constraint, ECM can be processed using decellularization methods intended to remove cells and donor antigens from tissue or organs, while preserving native biological cues essential for cell growth and differentiation. Recent studies show bioengineered organs composed by a combination of a diversity of materials and stem cells as a possibility of new therapeutic strategies to treat diseases that affect different tissues and organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). Nevertheless, the methodologies currently described for brain decellularization involve the use of several chemical reagents with many steps that ultimately limit the process of organ or tissue recellularization. Here, we describe for the first time a fast and straightforward method for complete decellularization of mice brain by the combination of rapid freezing and thawing following the use of only one detergent (Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)). Our data show that using the protocol we describe here, the brain was entirely decellularized, while still maintaining ECM components that are essential for cell survival on the scaffold. Our results also show the cell-loading of the decellularized brain matrix with Neuro2a cells, which were identified by immunohistochemistry in their undifferentiated form. We conclude that this novel and simple method for brain decellularization can be used as a scaffold for cell-loading.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we show that the liver-derived apolipoprotein M (ApoM) protects the lung and kidney from pro-fibrotic insults and that this circulating factor is attenuated in aged mice. Aged mouse hepatocytes exhibit transcriptional suppression of ApoM. This leads to reduced sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling via the S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) in the vascular endothelial cells of lung and kidney. Suboptimal S1PR1 angiocrine signaling causes reduced resistance to injury-induced vascular leak and leads to organ fibrosis. Plasma transfusion from Apom transgenic mice but not Apom knockout mice blocked fibrosis in the lung. Similarly, infusion of recombinant therapeutics, ApoM-Fc fusion protein enhanced kidney and lung regeneration and attenuated fibrosis in aged mouse after injury. Furthermore, we identified that aging alters Sirtuin-1-hepatic nuclear factor 4α circuit in hepatocytes to downregulate ApoM. These data reveal an integrative organ adaptation that involves circulating S1P chaperone ApoM+ high density lipoprotein (HDL), which signals via endothelial niche S1PR1 to spur regeneration over fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Subicular regions play important roles in spatial processing and many cognitive functions, and these are mainly attributed to the subiculum (Sub) rather than the prosubiculum (PS). Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify 27 transcriptomic cell types residing in sub-domains of the Sub and PS. Based on in situ expression of reliable transcriptomic markers, the precise boundaries of the Sub and PS are consistently defined along the dorsoventral axis. Using these borders to evaluate Cre-line specificity and tracer injections, we find bona fide Sub projections topographically to structures important for spatial processing and navigation. In contrast, the PS sends its outputs to widespread brain regions crucial for motivation, emotion, reward, stress, anxiety, and fear. The Sub and PS, respectively, dominate dorsal and ventral subicular regions and receive different afferents. These results reveal two molecularly and anatomically distinct circuits centered in the Sub and PS, respectively, providing a consistent explanation for historical data and a clearer foundation for future studies.

Abstract: Summary
CD1d-restricted invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells represent a unique class of T lymphocytes endowed with potent regulatory and effector immune functions. Although these functions are acquired during thymic ontogeny, the sequence of events that gives rise to discrete effector subsets remains unclear. Using an unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis combined with functional assays, we reveal an unappreciated diversity among thymic iNKT cells, especially among iNKT1 cells. Mathematical modeling and biological methods unravel a developmental map whereby iNKT2 cells constitute a transient branching point toward the generation of iNKT1 and iNKT17 cells, which reconciles the two previously proposed models. In addition, we identify the transcription co-factor Four-and-a-half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2) as a critical cell-intrinsic regulator of iNKT1 specification. Thus, these data illustrate the changing transcriptional network that guides iNKT cell effector fate.

Abstract: Summary
Sister-chromatid cohesion describes the orderly association of newly replicated DNA molecules behind replication forks. It plays an essential role in the maintenance and faithful transmission of genetic information. Cohesion is created by DNA topological links and proteinaceous bridges, whose formation and deposition could be potentially affected by many processes. Current knowledge on cohesion has been mainly gained by fluorescence microscopy observation. However, the resolution limit of microscopy and the restricted number of genomic positions that can be simultaneously visualized considerably hampered progress. Here, we present a high-throughput methodology to monitor sister-chromatid contacts (Hi-SC2). Using the multi-chromosomal Vibrio cholerae bacterium as a model, we show that Hi-SC2 permits to monitor local variations in sister-chromatid cohesion at a high resolution over a whole genome.

Abstract: Summary
Meiotic recombination proceeds via binding of RPA, RAD51, and DMC1 to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrates created after formation of programmed DNA double-strand breaks. Here we report high-resolution in vivo maps of RPA and RAD51 in meiosis, mapping their binding locations and lifespans to individual homologous chromosomes using a genetically engineered hybrid mouse. Together with high-resolution microscopy and DMC1 binding maps, we show that DMC1 and RAD51 have distinct spatial localization on ssDNA: DMC1 binds near the break site, and RAD51 binds away from it. We characterize inter-homolog recombination intermediates bound by RPA in vivo, with properties expected for the critical displacement loop (D-loop) intermediates. These data support the hypothesis that DMC1, not RAD51, performs strand exchange in mammalian meiosis. RPA-bound D-loops can be resolved as crossovers or non-crossovers, but crossover-destined D-loops may have longer lifespans. D-loops resemble crossover gene conversions in size, but their extent is similar in both repair pathways.

Abstract: Megalocytivirus infection is a major threat in rock bream aquaculture in Korea. To produce a highly concentrated megalocytivirus, primary cells, established cell line and persistently infected cell line were used in this study. Megalocytivirus was inoculated in primary fin cell cultures of red sea bream (Pagrus major), rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus), olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and black sea bream (Acanthopagrus schlegelii) and produced at similar concentrations of 108.99 − 9.88 viral particles/mL in all cultures while produced 107.31 viral particles/mL in grunt fin (GF) cell line. Since only red sea bream fin culture was amenable to subculturing for more than 100 times, it was established into Pagrus major fin (PMF) cell line. A persistently infected PMF cell line (PI-PMF) was obtained by continuous subculturing every 7 days as a batch culture system (PI-PMF-B) after infecting with megalocytivirus. Virus in supernatant of PI-PMF-B was maintained at high concentrations throughout over 50 consecutive subcultures in a relatively narrow range from 108.33 to 108.94 viral particles/mL with high level of CPE. For a more efficient and convenient production, a semi-batch culture system (PI-PMF-S) was developed in which culture media were exchanged at intervals of 3 days without subculturing for more than 50 media exchanges. Despite low virus productivity in a single cell (specific virus productivity, SVP), total cell number was increased in PI-PMF-S, allowing us to efficiently obtain a much higher concentration of virus (108.56 to 109.75 viral particles/mL) than in PMF-B. This is the first study to report detailed new methods for continuous and efficient production of high concentrations of megalocytivivrus with characterization of viral propagation in persistently infected cells.

Abstract: Summary
Nearly all biological processes rely on the finely tuned coordination of protein interactions across cellular space and time. Accordingly, generating protein interactomes has become routine in biological studies, yet interpreting these datasets remains computationally challenging. Here, we introduce Inter-ViSTA (Interaction Visualization in Space and Time Analysis), a web-based platform that quickly builds animated protein interaction networks and automatically synthesizes information on protein abundances, functions, complexes, and subcellular localizations. Using Inter-ViSTA with proteomics and molecular virology, we define virus-host interactions for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) anti-apoptotic protein, pUL37x1. We find that spatiotemporal controlled interactions underlie pUL37x1 functions, facilitating the pro-viral remodeling of mitochondria and peroxisomes during infection. Reciprocal isolations, microscopy, and genetic manipulations further characterize these associations, revealing the interplay between pUL37x1 and the MIB complex, which is critical for mitochondrial integrity. At the peroxisome, we show that pUL37x1 activates PEX11β to regulate fission, a key aspect of virus assembly and spread.

Abstract: Summary
Proteins of the lipocalin family are known to bind small hydrophobic ligands and are involved in various physiological processes ranging from lipid transport to oxidative stress responses. The genome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains a single protein PF3D7_0925900 with a lipocalin signature. Using crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering, we show that the protein has a tetrameric structure of typical lipocalin monomers; hence we name it P. falciparum lipocalin (PfLCN). We show that PfLCN is expressed in the intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite and localizes to the parasitophorous and food vacuoles. Conditional knockdown of PfLCN impairs parasite development, which can be rescued by treatment with the radical scavenger Trolox or by temporal inhibition of hemoglobin digestion. This suggests a key function of PfLCN in counteracting oxidative stress-induced cell damage during multiplication of parasites within erythrocytes.

Abstract: Summary
The astrocytic response to injury is characterized on the cellular level, but our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the cellular processes is incomplete. The astrocytic response to injury is similar to wound-healing responses in non-neural tissues that involve epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) and upregulation in ZEB transcription factors. Here we show that injury-induced astrogliosis increases EMT-related genes expression, including Zeb2, and long non-coding RNAs, including Zeb2os, which facilitates ZEB2 protein translation. In mouse models of either contusive spinal cord injury or transient ischemic stroke, the conditional knockout of Zeb2 in astrocytes attenuates astrogliosis, generates larger lesions, and delays the recovery of motor function. These findings reveal ZEB2 as an important regulator of the astrocytic response to injury and suggest that astrogliosis is an EMT-like process, which provides a conceptual connection for the molecular and cellular similarities between astrogliosis and wound-healing responses in non-neural tissue.

Abstract: Rhodnius prolixus is an important vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Insect adults have a pair of Metasternal Glands (MGs) and the secretion emitted by these glands acts as sex pheromone. Recent studies have focused on the chemical composition of this pheromone, electrophysiological responses to MGs compounds and mating behavior assays. Morphological studies of these glands are still scarce. Thus, considering the relevance of MGs in the sex pheromone biosynthesis, we investigated the morphology and ultrastructure of R. prolixus MGs. The glandular apparatus presents a tubular structure containing secretory cells with canalicules that fuse with the central duct which conducts the secretion to a pear-shaped reservoir connected to the exterior by a droplet-shape orifice. The secretory cells are classified as class III, they present a well-developed rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is a site of lipid biosynthesis that may be involved in the mevalonate pathway, a probable route of the sex pheromone biosynthesis in this insect. The presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum indicates a possible peptides/proteins secretions site which were still not characterized in MGs. Several mitochondria are scattered in the cytoplasm that may suggest a high metabolic activity. Further studies should be carried out to correlate these data with the sex pheromone biosynthesis in this vector.

Abstract: Summary
Antibiotics halt the growth of bacteria by targeting core, essential physiology that is required for life on standard microbiological media. Many more biochemical and virulence processes, however, are required for bacteria to cause infection in a host. Indeed, chemical inhibitors of the latter processes are overlooked using conventional antibiotic drug discovery approaches. Here, we use human blood serum as an alternative growth medium to explore new targets and compounds. High-throughput screening of genetic and chemical libraries identified compounds targeting biological activities required by Klebsiella pneumoniae to grow in serum, such as nucleobase biosynthesis and iron acquisition, and showed that serum can chemically transform compounds to reveal cryptic antibacterial activity. One of these compounds, ruthenium red, was effective in a rat bloodstream infection model. Our data demonstrate that human serum is an effective tool to find new chemical matter to address the current antibiotic resistance crisis.

Abstract: Summary
Evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways are crucial for adjusting growth, reproduction, and cell maintenance in response to altered environmental conditions or energy balance. However, we have an incomplete understanding of the signaling networks and mechanistic changes that coordinate physiological changes across tissues. We found that loss of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor significantly slows Caenorhabditis elegans’ reproductive decline, an early hallmark of aging in many animals. Our results indicate that CREB acts downstream of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) Sma/Mab pathway in the hypodermis to control reproductive aging, and that it does so by regulating a Hedgehog-related signaling factor, WRT-10. Overexpression of hypodermal wrt-10 is sufficient to delay reproductive decline and oocyte quality deterioration, potentially acting via Patched-related receptors in the germline. This TGF-β-CREB-Hedgehog signaling axis allows a key metabolic tissue to communicate with the reproductive system to regulate oocyte quality and the rate of reproductive decline.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is defined by an accumulation of immature myeloid blasts in the bone marrow. To identify key dependencies of AML stem cells in vivo, here we use a CRISPR-Cas9 screen targeting cell surface genes in a syngeneic MLL-AF9 AML mouse model and show that CXCR4 is a top cell surface regulator of AML cell growth and survival. Deletion of Cxcr4 in AML cells eradicates leukemia cells in vivo without impairing their homing to the bone marrow. In contrast, the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 is dispensable for leukemia development in recipient mice. Moreover, expression of mutated Cxcr4 variants reveals that CXCR4 signaling is essential for leukemia cells. Notably, loss of CXCR4 signaling in leukemia cells leads to oxidative stress and differentiation in vivo. Taken together, our results identify CXCR4 signaling as essential for AML stem cells by protecting them from differentiation independent of CXCL12 stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
In response to estrogens, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), a critical regulator of homeostasis, is degraded through the 26S proteasome. However, despite the continued presence of estrogen before menopause, ERα protein levels are maintained. We discovered that ERK1/2-RSK2 activity oscillates during the estrous cycle. In response to high estrogen levels, ERK1/2 is activated and phosphorylates ERα to drive ERα degradation and estrogen-responsive gene expression. Reduction of estrogen levels results in ERK1/2 deactivation. RSK2 maintains redox homeostasis, which prevents sustained ERK1/2 activation. In juveniles, ERK1/2-RSK2 activity is not required. Mammary gland regeneration demonstrates that ERK1/2-RSK2 regulation of ERα is intrinsic to the epithelium. Reduced RSK2 and enrichment in an estrogen-regulated gene signature occur in individuals taking oral contraceptives. RSK2 loss enhances DNA damage, which may account for the elevated breast cancer risk with the use of exogenous estrogens. These findings implicate RSK2 as a critical component for the preservation of estrogen homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Many FA proteins are recruited to ICLs in a timely fashion so that coordinated repair can occur. However, the mechanism of this process is poorly understood. Here, we report the purification of a FANCD2-containing protein complex with multiple subunits, including WRNIP1. Using live-cell imaging, we show that WRNIP1 is recruited to ICLs quickly after their appearance, promoting repair. The observed recruitment facilitates subsequent recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex. Depletion of WRNIP1 sensitizes cells to ICL-forming drugs. We find that ubiquitination of WRNIP1 and the activity of its UBZ domain are required to facilitate recruitment of FANCD2/FANCI and promote repair. Altogether, we describe a mechanism by which WRNIP1 is recruited rapidly to ICLs, resulting in chromatin loading of the FANCD2/FANCI complex in an unusual process entailing ubiquitination of WRNIP1 and the activity of its integral UBZ domain.

Abstract: Summary
Chemogenetics enables manipulation of neuronal activity in experimental animals. While providing information about the transduced neuron expressing a ligand-activated molecule, chemogenetics does not provide understanding about the antecedent circuit that drives that neuron’s activity. For current approaches, this is not feasible, because the activating molecules are not genetically encoded. The insect allatostatin/allatostatin receptor system, a highly specific, powerful inhibitory chemogenetic approach, has this advantage, because the ligand, being a peptide, is genetically encoded. We developed viral vector-based systems to express biologically active allatostatin in neurons in vivo and allatostatin receptors in subpopulations of postsynaptic neurons. We demonstrate that activity-dependent release of allatostatin induces inhibition of allatostatin receptor-expressing neurons. We validate the approach in the vagal viscerosensory system where inhibitory, rather than the usual excitatory, viscerosensory input leads to sustained decreases in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity and bodyweight.

Abstract: Summary
The hydrophobic patch (hp), a docking pocket on cyclins of CDKs (cyclin-dependent kinases), has been thought to accommodate a single short linear motif (SLiM), the “RxL or Cy” docking motif. Here we show that hp can bind different motifs with high specificity. We identify a PxxPxF motif that is necessary for G2-cyclin Clb3 function in S. cerevisiae, and that mediates Clb3-Cdk1 phosphorylation of Ypr174c (proposed name: Cdc5 SPB anchor-Csa1) to regulate the localization of Polo kinase Cdc5. Similar motifs exist in other Clb3-Cdk1 targets. Our work completes the set of docking specificities for the four major cyclins: LP, RxL, PxxPxF, and LxF motifs for G1-, S-, G2-, and M-phase cyclins, respectively. Further, we show that variations in motifs can change their specificity for human cyclins. This diversity could provide complexity for the encoding of CDK thresholds to achieve ordered cell-cycle phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
The physiological role of immune cells in the regulation of postprandial glucose metabolism has not been fully elucidated. We have found that adipose tissue macrophages produce interleukin-10 (IL-10) upon feeding, which suppresses hepatic glucose production in cooperation with insulin. Both elevated insulin and gut-microbiome-derived lipopolysaccharide in response to feeding are required for IL-10 production via the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Indeed, myeloid-specific knockout of the insulin receptor or bone marrow transplantation of mutant TLR4 marrow cells results in increased expression of gluconeogenic genes and impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, myeloid-specific Akt1 and Akt2 knockout results in similar phenotypes that are rescued by additional knockout of TSC2, an inhibitor of mTOR. In obesity, IL-10 production is impaired due to insulin resistance in macrophages, whereas adenovirus-mediated expression of IL-10 ameliorates postprandial hyperglycemia. Thus, the orchestrated response of the endogenous hormone and gut environment to feeding is a key regulator of postprandial glycemia.

Abstract: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of lithium heparin and K2EDTA on haematology, biochemical parameters and blood cell morphology of snow trout Schizopyge plagiostomus inhabiting in Kashmir Himalayan region. The haematological parameters such as hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cellcount (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), haematocrit (Hct), erythrocyte indices; mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), produced certain significant differences in their values with respect to both anticoagulants. Higher values of Hct, MCH and MCV while lower RBC count and MCHC values were recorded with a sample treated with K2EDTA compared to sample treated with lithium heparin. However, no significant change in Hb and WBC count was observed in the values of samples treated with both the anticoagulants. In the present study, the effect of two anticoagulant in biochemical parameters revealed that the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate transaminase (AST) produced significant (P < 0.05) differences. Higher AST and lower ALP activity were recorded in the sample treated with K2EDTA compared to overall values in serum. Morphometric analysis showed an increase in the RBC perimeter area in samples treated with K2EDTA as compared to samples treated with lithium heparin. On the basis of above findings, it is recommended that in fish blood analysis heparin as anticoagulant could be useful as compared to K2 EDTA.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR genome engineering has become a powerful tool to functionally investigate the complex mechanisms of immune system regulation. While decades of work have aimed to genetically reprogram innate immunity, the utility of current approaches is restricted by poor knockout efficiencies or limited specificity for mature cell lineages in vivo. Here, we describe an optimized strategy for non-viral CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (cRNP) genomic editing of mature primary mouse innate lymphocyte cells (ILCs) and myeloid lineage cells that results in an almost complete loss of single or double target gene expression from a single electroporation. Furthermore, we describe in vivo adoptive transfer mouse models that can be utilized to screen for gene function during viral infection using cRNP-edited naive natural killer (NK) cells and bone-marrow-derived conventional dendritic cell precursors (cDCPs). This resource will enhance target gene discovery and offer a specific and simplified approach to gene editing in the mouse innate immune system.

Abstract: Summary
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant and accumulate with age in neurons of diverse species. However, only few circRNAs have been functionally characterized, and their role during aging has not been addressed. Here, we use transcriptome profiling during aging and find that accumulation of circRNAs is slowed down in long-lived insulin mutant flies. Next, we characterize the in vivo function of a circRNA generated by the sulfateless gene (circSfl), which is consistently upregulated, particularly in the brain and muscle, of diverse long-lived insulin mutants. Strikingly, lifespan extension of insulin mutants is dependent on circSfl, and overexpression of circSfl alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan. Moreover, circSfl is translated into a protein that shares the N terminus and potentially some functions with the full-length Sfl protein encoded by the host gene. Our study demonstrates that insulin signaling affects global circRNA accumulation and reveals an important role of circSfl during aging in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Vδ2+ T cells play a critical role in immunity to micro-organisms and cancer but exhibit substantial heterogeneity in humans. Here, we demonstrate that CD26 and CD94 define transcriptionally, phenotypically, and functionally distinct Vδ2+ T cell subsets. Despite distinct antigen specificities, CD26hiCD94lo Vδ2+ cells exhibit substantial similarities to CD26hi mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, although CD26− Vδ2+ cells exhibit cytotoxic, effector-like profiles. At birth, the Vδ2+Vγ9+ population is dominated by CD26hiCD94lo cells; during adolescence and adulthood, Vδ2+ cells acquire CD94/NKG2A expression and the relative frequency of the CD26hiCD94lo subset declines. Critically, exposure of the CD26hiCD94lo subset to phosphoantigen in the context of interleukin-23 (IL-23) and CD26 engagement drives the acquisition of a cytotoxic program and concurrent loss of the MAIT cell-like phenotype. The ability to modulate the cytotoxic potential of CD26hiCD94lo Vδ2+ cells, combined with their adenosine-binding capacity, may make them ideal targets for immunotherapeutic expansion and adoptive transfer.

Abstract: Summary
Nervous tissue homeostasis requires the regulation of microglia activity. Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of the small GTPase Rhoa in adult microglia is sufficient to trigger spontaneous microglia activation, producing a neurological phenotype (including synapse and neuron loss, impairment of long-term potentiation [LTP], formation of β-amyloid plaques, and memory deficits). Mechanistically, loss of Rhoa in microglia triggers Src activation and Src-mediated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production, leading to excitotoxic glutamate secretion. Inhibiting Src in microglia Rhoa-deficient mice attenuates microglia dysregulation and the ensuing neurological phenotype. We also find that the Rhoa/Src signaling pathway is disrupted in microglia of the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer disease and that low doses of Aβ oligomers trigger microglia neurotoxic polarization through the disruption of Rhoa-to-Src signaling. Overall, our results indicate that disturbing Rho GTPase signaling in microglia can directly cause neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Post-translational modification by SUMO is a key regulator of cell identity. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), SUMO impedes reprogramming to pluripotency, while in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), it represses the emergence of totipotent-like cells, suggesting that SUMO targets distinct substrates to preserve somatic and pluripotent states. Using MS-based proteomics, we show that the composition of endogenous SUMOylomes differs dramatically between MEFs and ESCs. In MEFs, SUMO2/3 targets proteins associated with canonical SUMO functions, such as splicing, and transcriptional regulators driving somatic enhancer selection. In contrast, in ESCs, SUMO2/3 primarily modifies highly interconnected repressive chromatin complexes, thereby preventing chromatin opening and transitioning to totipotent-like states. We also characterize several SUMO-modified pluripotency factors and show that SUMOylation of Dppa2 and Dppa4 impedes the conversion to 2-cell-embryo-like states. Altogether, we propose that rewiring the repertoire of SUMO target networks is a major driver of cell fate decision during embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a catabolic process involving capture of cytoplasmic materials into double-membraned autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with lysosomes for degradation of the materials by lysosomal hydrolases. One of the least understood components of the autophagy machinery is the transmembrane protein ATG9. Here, we report a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the human ATG9A isoform at 2.9-Å resolution. The structure reveals a fold with a homotrimeric domain-swapped architecture, multiple membrane spans, and a network of branched cavities, consistent with ATG9A being a membrane transporter. Mutational analyses support a role for the cavities in the function of ATG9A. In addition, structure-guided molecular simulations predict that ATG9A causes membrane bending, explaining the localization of this protein to small vesicles and highly curved edges of growing autophagosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Tissues undergoing morphogenesis impose mechanical effects on one another. How developmental programs adapt to or take advantage of these effects remains poorly explored. Here, using a combination of live imaging, modeling, and microsurgical perturbations, we show that the axial and paraxial tissues in the forming avian embryonic body coordinate their rates of elongation through mechanical interactions. First, a cell motility gradient drives paraxial presomitic mesoderm (PSM) expansion, resulting in compression of the axial neural tube and notochord; second, elongation of axial tissues driven by PSM compression and polarized cell intercalation pushes the caudal progenitor domain posteriorly; finally, the axial push drives the lateral movement of midline PSM cells to maintain PSM growth and cell motility. These interactions form an engine-like positive feedback loop, which sustains a shared elongation rate for coupled tissues. Our results demonstrate a key role of inter-tissue forces in coordinating distinct body axis tissues during their co-elongation.

Abstract: Summary
Basement membranes (BMs) are supramolecular matrices built on laminin and type IV collagen networks that provide structural and signaling support to tissues. BM complexity, however, has hindered an understanding of its formation, dynamics, and regulation. Using genome editing, we tagged 29 BM matrix components and receptors in C. elegans with mNeonGreen. Here, we report a common template that initiates BM formation, which rapidly diversifies during tissue differentiation. Through photobleaching studies, we show that BMs are not static—surprisingly, many matrix proteins move within the laminin and collagen scaffoldings. Finally, quantitative imaging, conditional knockdown, and optical highlighting indicate that papilin, a poorly studied glycoprotein, is the most abundant component in the gonadal BM, where it facilitates type IV collagen removal during BM expansion and tissue growth. Together, this work introduces methods for holistic investigation of BM regulation and reveals that BMs are highly dynamic and capable of rapid change to support tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is pervasive in the human genome. However, the mechanisms controlling transcription at promoters and enhancers remain enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that Integrator subunit 11 (INTS11), the catalytic subunit of the Integrator complex, regulates transcription at these loci through its endonuclease activity. Promoters of genes require INTS11 to cleave nascent transcripts associated with paused RNAPII and induce their premature termination in the proximity of the +1 nucleosome. The turnover of RNAPII permits the subsequent recruitment of an elongation-competent RNAPII complex, leading to productive elongation. In contrast, enhancers require INTS11 catalysis not to evict paused RNAPII but rather to terminate enhancer RNA transcription beyond the +1 nucleosome. These findings are supported by the differential occupancy of negative elongation factor (NELF), SPT5, and tyrosine-1-phosphorylated RNAPII. This study elucidates the role of Integrator in mediating transcriptional elongation at human promoters through the endonucleolytic cleavage of nascent transcripts and the dynamic turnover of RNAPII.

Abstract: Summary
Sarcomeres, the fundamental contractile units of muscles, are conserved structures composed of actin thin filaments and myosin thick filaments. How sarcomeres are formed and maintained is not well understood. Here, we show that knockdown of Drosophila cofilin (DmCFL), an actin depolymerizing factor, disrupts both sarcomere structure and muscle function. The loss of DmCFL also results in the formation of sarcomeric protein aggregates and impairs sarcomere addition during growth. The activation of the proteasome delays muscle deterioration in our model. Furthermore, we investigate how a point mutation in CFL2 that causes nemaline myopathy (NM) in humans affects CFL function and leads to the muscle phenotypes observed in vivo. Our data provide significant insights to the role of CFLs during sarcomere formation, as well as mechanistic implications for disease progression in NM patients.

Abstract: Summary
Vitamin-D-binding protein (DBP) or group-specific component of serum (GC-globulin) carries vitamin D metabolites from the circulation to target tissues. DBP is highly localized to the liver and pancreatic α cells. Although DBP serum levels, gene polymorphisms, and autoantigens have all been associated with diabetes risk, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that DBP regulates α cell morphology, α cell function, and glucagon secretion. Deletion of DBP leads to smaller and hyperplastic α cells, altered Na+ channel conductance, impaired α cell activation by low glucose, and reduced rates of glucagon secretion both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, this involves reversible changes in islet microfilament abundance and density, as well as changes in glucagon granule distribution. Defects are also seen in β cell and δ cell function. Immunostaining of human pancreata reveals generalized loss of DBP expression as a feature of late-onset and long-standing, but not early-onset, type 1 diabetes. Thus, DBP regulates α cell phenotype, with implications for diabetes pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagic degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy) is triggered by ER stress in diverse organisms. However, molecular mechanisms governing ER stress-induced ER-phagy remain insufficiently understood. Here we report that ER stress-induced ER-phagy in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe requires Epr1, a soluble Atg8-interacting ER-phagy receptor. Epr1 localizes to the ER through interacting with integral ER membrane proteins VAPs. Bridging an Atg8-VAP association is the main ER-phagy role of Epr1, as it can be bypassed by an artificial Atg8-VAP tether. VAPs contribute to ER-phagy not only by tethering Atg8 to the ER membrane, but also by maintaining the ER-plasma membrane contact. Epr1 is upregulated during ER stress by the unfolded protein response (UPR) regulator Ire1. Loss of Epr1 reduces survival against ER stress. Conversely, increasing Epr1 expression suppresses the ER-phagy defect and ER stress sensitivity of cells lacking Ire1. Our findings expand and deepen the molecular understanding of ER-phagy.

Abstract: Summary
ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier that also functions extracellularly, signaling through the LFA-1 integrin to promote interferon (IFN)-γ release from natural killer (NK) and T cells. The signals that lead to the production of extracellular ISG15 and the relationship between its two core functions remain unclear. We show that both epithelial cells and lymphocytes can secrete ISG15, which then signals in either an autocrine or paracrine manner to LFA-1-expressing cells. Microbial pathogens and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists result in both IFN-β-dependent and -independent secretion of ISG15, and residues required for ISG15 secretion are mapped. Intracellular ISGylation inhibits secretion, and viral effector proteins, influenza B NS1, and viral de-ISGylases, including SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, have opposing effects on secretion of ISG15. These results establish extracellular ISG15 as a cytokine-like protein that bridges early innate and IFN-γ-dependent immune responses, and indicate that pathogens have evolved to differentially inhibit the intracellular and extracellular functions of ISG15.

Abstract: Summary
Type III CRISPR-Cas systems initiate an intracellular signaling pathway to confer immunity. The signaling pathway includes synthesis of cyclic oligo-adenylate (cOA) and activation of the RNase activity of type III accessory ribonuclease Csm6/Csx1 by cOA. After the immune response, cOA should be cleared on time to avoid constant cellular RNA degradation. In this study, we find a metal-dependent cOA degradation activity in Sulfolobus islandicus. The activity is associated with the cell membrane and able to accelerate cOA clearance at a high cOA level. Further, we show that a metal-dependent and membrane-associated DHH-DHHA1 family nuclease (MAD) rapidly cleaves cOA and deactivates Csx1 ribonuclease. The cOA degradation efficiency of MAD is much higher than the cellular ring nuclease. However, the subcellular organization may prevent it from degrading nascent cOA. Together, the data suggest that MAD acts as the second cOA degrader after the ring nuclease to remove diffused redundant cOA.

Abstract: Summary
Acinetobacter baumannii is a leading cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia and a critical threat due to multidrug resistance. The A. baumannii outer membrane is an asymmetric lipid bilayer composed of inner leaflet glycerophospholipids and outer leaflet lipooligosaccharides. Deleting mlaF of the maintenance of lipid asymmetry (Mla) system causes A. baumannii to become more susceptible to pulmonary surfactants and antibiotics and decreases bacterial survival in the lungs of mice. Spontaneous suppressor mutants isolated from infected mice contain an ISAba11 insertion upstream of the ispB initiation codon, an essential isoprenoid biosynthesis gene. The insertion restores antimicrobial resistance and virulence to ΔmlaF. The suppressor strain increases lipooligosaccharides, suggesting that the mechanism involves balancing the glycerophospholipids/lipooligosaccharides ratio on the bacterial surface. An identical insertion exists in an extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii isolate, demonstrating its clinical relevance. These data show that the stresses bacteria encounter during infection select for genomic rearrangements that increase resistance to antimicrobials.

Abstract: High-resolution Ca2+ imaging to study cellular Ca2+ behaviors has led to the creation of large datasets with a profound need for standardized and accurate analysis. To analyze these datasets, spatio-temporal maps (STMaps) that allow for 2D visualization of Ca2+ signals as a function of time and space are often used. Methods of STMap analysis rely on a highly arduous process of user defined segmentation and event-based data retrieval. These methods are often time consuming, lack accuracy, and are extremely variable between users. We designed a novel automated machine-learning based plugin for the analysis of Ca2+ STMaps (STMapAuto). The plugin includes optimized tools for Ca2+ signal preprocessing, automated segmentation, and automated extraction of key Ca2+ event information such as duration, spatial spread, frequency, propagation angle, and intensity in a variety of cell types including the Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). The plugin is fully implemented in Fiji and able to accurately detect and expeditiously quantify Ca2+ transient parameters from ICC. The plugin’s speed of analysis of large-datasets was 197-fold faster than the commonly used single pixel-line method of analysis. The automated machine-learning based plugin described dramatically reduces opportunities for user error and provides a consistent method to allow high-throughput analysis of STMap datasets.

Abstract: Summary
The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and coronavirus spike (S) protein mediate virus entry. HA and S proteins are heavily glycosylated, making them potential targets for carbohydrate binding agents such as lectins. Here, we show that the lectin FRIL, isolated from hyacinth beans (Lablab purpureus), has anti-influenza and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. FRIL can neutralize 11 representative human and avian influenza strains at low nanomolar concentrations, and intranasal administration of FRIL is protective against lethal H1N1 infection in mice. FRIL binds preferentially to complex-type N-glycans and neutralizes viruses that possess complex-type N-glycans on their envelopes. As a homotetramer, FRIL is capable of aggregating influenza particles through multivalent binding and trapping influenza virions in cytoplasmic late endosomes, preventing their nuclear entry. Remarkably, FRIL also effectively neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, preventing viral protein production and cytopathic effect in host cells. These findings suggest a potential application of FRIL for the prevention and/or treatment of influenza and COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
During embryonic development and cancer metastasis, migratory cells must establish stable connections with new partners at their destinations. Here, we establish the Drosophila border cells as a model for this multistep process. During oogenesis, border cells delaminate from the follicular epithelium and migrate. When they reach their target, the oocyte, they undergo a stereotypical series of steps to adhere to it, then connect with another migrating epithelium. We identify gap-junction-forming innexin proteins as critical. Surprisingly, the channel function is dispensable. Instead, Innexins 2 and 3 function within the border cells, and Innexin 4 functions within the germline, to regulate microtubules. The microtubule-dependent border cell-oocyte interaction is essential to brace the cells against external morphogenetic forces. Thus, we establish an experimental model and use genetic, thermogenetic, and live-imaging approaches to uncover the contributions of Innexins and microtubules to a cell-biological process important in development and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
In the hippocampus, locations associated with salient features are represented by a disproportionately large number of neurons, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this over-representation remain elusive. Using longitudinal calcium imaging in mice learning to navigate in virtual reality, we find that the over-representation of reward and landmark locations are mediated by persistent and separable subsets of neurons, with distinct time courses of emergence and differing underlying molecular mechanisms. Strikingly, we find that in mice lacking Shank2, an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-linked gene encoding an excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein, the learning-induced over-representation of landmarks was absent whereas the over-representation of rewards was substantially increased, as was goal-directed behavior. These findings demonstrate that multiple hippocampal coding processes for unique types of salient features are distinguished by a Shank2-dependent mechanism and suggest that abnormally distorted hippocampal salience mapping may underlie cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in a subset of ASDs.

Abstract: Summary
The pyrrolysyl-tRNA/pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylT/RS) pair from the archaeon Methanosarcina mazei (Mma) is widely used in protein engineering to site-specifically introduce noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) through nonsense codon suppression. Here, we engineer the PylT/RS pair encoded by Methanogenic archaeon ISO4-G1 (G1) to be orthogonal to Mma PylT/RS and alter the G1 PylRS active site to accept a complementary ncAA spectrum. We combine the resulting mutual orthogonal pairs for site-specific dual ncAA incorporation of two lysine analogs with high selectivity and efficiency. Demonstrating the robustness of the system, we incorporate two ncAAs with compatible bioorthogonal reactivity into a Notch receptor, as well as a G protein-coupled receptor. We show that selective and site-specific incorporation of two ncAAs allows for two-color bioorthogonal labeling as well as chemical-controlled crosslinking of surface proteins on live mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA such as enhancers underlie a wide variety of diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. As enhancers rapidly evolve, understanding their function and configuration in non-human disease models can have important clinical applications. Here, we analyze enhancer configurations in tissues isolated from the common marmoset, a widely used primate model for human disease. Integrating these data with human and mouse data, we find that enhancers containing trait-associated variants are preferentially conserved. In contrast, most human-specific enhancers are highly variable between individuals, with a subset failing to contact promoters. These are located further away from genes and more often reside in inactive B-compartments. Our data show that enhancers typically emerge as instable elements with minimal biological impact prior to their integration in a transcriptional program. Furthermore, our data provide insight into which trait variations in enhancers can be faithfully modeled using the common marmoset.

Abstract: Summary
Gradients of decapentaplegic (Dpp) pattern Drosophila wing imaginal discs, establishing gene expression boundaries at specific locations. As discs grow, Dpp gradients expand, keeping relative boundary positions approximately stationary. Such scaling fails in mutants for Pentagone (pent), a gene repressed by Dpp that encodes a diffusible protein that expands Dpp gradients. Although these properties fit a recent mathematical model of automatic gradient scaling, that model requires an expander that spreads with minimal loss throughout a morphogen field. Here, we show that Pent’s actions are confined to within just a few cell diameters of its site of synthesis and can be phenocopied by manipulating non-diffusible Pent targets strictly within the Pent expression domain. Using genetics and mathematical modeling, we develop an alternative model of scaling driven by feedback downregulation of Dpp receptors and co-receptors. Among the model’s predictions is a size beyond which scaling fails—something we observe directly in wing discs.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) represent a major population in the control of immune homeostasis and autoimmunity. Here we show that Fos-like 2 (Fosl2), a TCR-induced AP1 transcription factor, represses Treg development and controls autoimmunity. Mice overexpressing Fosl2 (Fosl2tg) indeed show a systemic inflammatory phenotype, with immune infiltrates in multiple organs. This phenotype is absent in Fosl2tg × Rag2−/− mice lacking T and B cells, and Fosl2 induces T cell-intrinsic reduction of Treg development that is responsible for the inflammatory phenotype. Fosl2tg T cells can transfer inflammation, which is suppressed by the co-delivery of Tregs, while Fosl2 deficiency in T cells reduces the severity of autoimmunity in the EAE model. We find that Fosl2 could affect expression of FoxP3 and other Treg development genes. Our data highlight the importance of AP1 transcription factors, in particular Fosl2, during T cell development to determine Treg differentiation and control autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
Human antibody repertoire data captured through next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled deeper insights into B cell immunogenetics and paratope diversity. By analyzing large public NGS datasets, we map the landscape of non-canonical cysteines in human variable heavy-chain domains (VHs) at the repertoire level. We identify remarkable usage of non-canonical cysteines within the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR-H3) and other CDRs and framework regions. Furthermore, our study reveals the diversity and location of non-canonical cysteines and their associated motifs in human VHs, which are reminiscent of and more complex than those found in other non-human species such as chicken, camel, llama, shark, and cow. These results explain how non-canonical cysteines strategically occur in the human antibodyome to expand its paratope space. This study will guide the design of human antibodies harboring disulfide-stabilized long CDR-H3s to access difficult-to-target epitopes and influence a paradigm shift in developability involving non-canonical cysteines.

Abstract: Cytoplasmic Ca2+ is a pivotal regulator of IP3R activity. It is however controversial whether the [Ca2+] in the Endoplasmic Reticulum lumen also directly regulates channel function. We highlight a recent paper that demonstrates that luminal [Ca2+] potently inhibits IP3R activity. This regulation occurs indirectly by an interaction mediated through a binding partner, likely Annexin 1A.

Abstract: To cure the epidemic of diabetes, in vitro produced β-like cells are lauded for cell therapy of diabetic patients. In this regard, we investigated the effects of different concentrations of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) on the differentiation of rat pancreatic ductal epithelial-like stem cells (PDESCs) into β-like cells. For inducement of the differentiation, PDESCs were cultured in the basal media (H-DMEM + 10 % FBS + 1% penicillin-streptomycin) supplemented with 5 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL, 15 ng/mL, and 20 ng/mL of BMP7 for 28 days. To corroborate the identity of induced cells, they were examined through cell morphology, dithizone (DTZ) staining, immunofluorescence staining, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assay (GSIS). The enrichment of induced cells was high among 5 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL, 15 ng/mL, and 20 ng/mL of BMP7 supplemented groups as compared to the control group. Further, the induced cells were positive, while, the control group cells were negative to DTZ staining and the differentiated cells also have shown the upregulated expression of β cell-specific marker genes (Ins1 and Pdx1). The GSIS assay of inducement groups for insulin and C-peptide secretion has shown significantly higher values as compared to the control group (P < 0.01). Hence, the addition of BMP7 to basal medium has effectually induced differentiation of adult rat PDESCs into islet like-cell clusters containing insulin-secreting β-like cells.

Abstract: Summary
BORC is a multisubunit complex previously shown to promote coupling of mammalian lysosomes and C. elegans synaptic vesicle (SV) precursors (SVPs) to kinesins for anterograde transport of these organelles along microtubule tracks. We attempted to meld these observations into a unified model for axonal transport in mammalian neurons by testing two alternative hypotheses: (1) that SV and lysosomal proteins are co-transported within a single type of “lysosome-related vesicle” and (2) that SVPs and lysosomes are distinct organelles, but both depend on BORC for axonal transport. Analyses of various types of neurons from wild-type rats and mice, as well as from BORC-deficient mice, show that neither hypothesis is correct. We find that SVPs and lysosomes are transported separately, but only lysosomes depend on BORC for axonal transport in these neurons. These findings demonstrate that SVPs and lysosomes are distinct organelles that rely on different machineries for axonal transport in mammalian neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Multivalent complexes of endothelial adhesion receptors (e.g., selectins) engage leukocytes to orchestrate their migration to inflamed tissues. Proper anchorage and sufficient density (clustering) of endothelial receptors are required for efficient leukocyte capture and rolling. We demonstrate that a polarized spectrin network dictates the stability of the endothelial cytoskeleton, which is attached to the apical membrane, at least in part, by the abundant transmembrane protein CD44. Single-particle tracking revealed that CD44 undergoes prolonged periods of immobilization as it tethers to the cytoskeleton. The CD44-spectrin “picket fence” alters the behavior of bystander molecules—notably, selectins—curtailing their mobility, inducing their apical accumulation, and favoring their clustering within caveolae. Accordingly, depletion of either spectrin or CD44 virtually eliminated leukocyte rolling and adhesion to the endothelium. Our results indicate that a unique spectrin-based apical cytoskeleton tethered to transmembrane pickets—notably, CD44—is essential for proper extravasation of leukocytes in response to inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a pathway that degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons. Here we describe a genome-wide screen for NMD factors that uncovers an unexpected mechanism that broadly governs 3ʹ untranslated region (UTR)-directed regulation. The screen reveals that NMD requires lysosomal acidification, which allows transferrin-mediated iron uptake, which, in turn, is necessary for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. This pathway maintains the activity of the Fe-S cluster-containing ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, whose impaired function results in movement of ribosomes into 3ʹ UTRs, where they displace exon junction complexes, abrogating NMD. Importantly, these effects extend beyond NMD substrates, with ABCE1 activity required to maintain the accessibility of 3ʹ UTRs to diverse regulators, including microRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Because of the sensitivity of the Fe-S cluster of ABCE1 to iron availability and reactive oxygen species, these findings reveal an unanticipated vulnerability of 3ʹ UTR-directed regulation to lysosomal dysfunction, iron deficiency, and oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), members of the Flavivirus genus, rearrange endoplasmic reticulum membranes to induce invaginations known as vesicle packets (VPs), which are the assumed sites for viral RNA replication. Mechanistic information on VP biogenesis has so far been difficult to attain due to the necessity of studying their formation under conditions of viral replication, where perturbations reducing replication will inevitably impact VP formation. Here, we report a replication-independent expression system, designated pIRO (plasmid-induced replication organelle formation) that induces bona fide DENV and ZIKV VPs that are morphologically indistinguishable from those in infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate that sequences in the 3′ terminal RNA region of the DENV, but not the ZIKV genome, contribute to VP formation in a non-replicative manner. These results validate the pIRO system that opens avenues for mechanistically dissecting virus replication from membrane reorganization.

Abstract: Summary
Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is an essential transcriptional event in embryonic development that coincides with extensive epigenetic reprogramming. Complex manipulation techniques and maternal stores of proteins preclude large-scale functional screens for ZGA regulators within early embryos. Here, we combined pooled CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) with single-cell transcriptomics to identify regulators of ZGA-like transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells, which serve as a tractable, in vitro proxy of early mouse embryos. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA+) applied to ∼200,000 single-cell transcriptomes comprising 230 CRISPRa perturbations, we characterized molecular signatures of ZGA and uncovered 24 factors that promote a ZGA-like response. Follow-up assays validated top screen hits, including the DNA-binding protein Dppa2, the chromatin remodeler Smarca5, and the transcription factor Patz1, and functional experiments revealed that Smarca5’s regulation of ZGA-like transcription is dependent on Dppa2. Together, our single-cell transcriptomic profiling of CRISPRa-perturbed cells provides both system-level and molecular insights into the mechanisms that orchestrate ZGA.

Abstract: Summary
Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) involves compensatory mechanisms employed by neurons and circuits to preserve signaling when confronted with global changes in activity that may occur during physiological and pathological conditions. Cholinergic neurons, which are especially affected in some pathologies, have recently been shown to exhibit HSP mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In Drosophila central neurons, pharmacological blockade of activity induces a homeostatic response mediated by the Drosophila α7 (Dα7) nAChR, which is tuned by a subsequent increase in expression of the voltage-dependent Kv4/Shal channel. Here, we show that an in vivo reduction of cholinergic signaling induces HSP mediated by Dα7 nAChRs, and this upregulation of Dα7 itself is sufficient to trigger transcriptional activation, mediated by nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), of the Kv4/Shal gene, revealing a receptor-ion channel system coupled for homeostatic tuning in cholinergic neurons.

Abstract: Summary
In contrast to the bacterial translation machinery, mitoribosomes and mitochondrial translation factors are highly divergent in terms of composition and architecture. There is increasing evidence that the biogenesis of mitoribosomes is an intricate pathway, involving many assembly factors. To better understand this process, we investigated native assembly intermediates of the mitoribosomal large subunit from the human parasite Trypanosoma brucei using cryo-electron microscopy. We identify 28 assembly factors, 6 of which are homologous to bacterial and eukaryotic ribosome assembly factors. They interact with the partially folded rRNA by specifically recognizing functionally important regions such as the peptidyltransferase center. The architectural and compositional comparison of the assembly intermediates indicates a stepwise modular assembly process, during which the rRNA folds toward its mature state. During the process, several conserved GTPases and a helicase form highly intertwined interaction networks that stabilize distinct assembly intermediates. The presented structures provide general insights into mitoribosomal maturation.

Abstract: Summary
To predict the tropism of human coronaviruses, we profile 28 SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated receptors and factors (SCARFs) using single-cell transcriptomics across various healthy human tissues. SCARFs include cellular factors both facilitating and restricting viral entry. Intestinal goblet cells, enterocytes, and kidney proximal tubule cells appear highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with clinical data. Our analysis also predicts non-canonical entry paths for lung and brain infections. Spermatogonial cells and prostate endocrine cells also appear to be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting male-specific vulnerabilities. Both pro- and anti-viral factors are highly expressed within the nasal epithelium, with potential age-dependent variation, predicting an important battleground for coronavirus infection. Our analysis also suggests that early embryonic and placental development are at moderate risk of infection. Lastly, SCARF expression appears broadly conserved across a subset of primate organs examined. Our study establishes a resource for investigations of coronavirus biology and pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Translating ribosomes that slow excessively incur collisions with trailing ribosomes. Persistent collisions are detected by ZNF598, a ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates sites on the ribosomal 40S subunit to initiate pathways of mRNA and protein quality control. The collided ribosome complex must be disassembled to initiate downstream quality control, but the mechanistic basis of disassembly is unclear. Here, we reconstitute the disassembly of a collided polysome in a mammalian cell-free system. The widely conserved ASC-1 complex (ASCC) containing the ASCC3 helicase disassembles the leading ribosome in an ATP-dependent reaction. Disassembly, but not ribosome association, requires 40S ubiquitination by ZNF598, but not GTP-dependent factors, including the Pelo-Hbs1L ribosome rescue complex. Trailing ribosomes can elongate once the roadblock has been removed and only become targets if they subsequently stall and incur collisions. These findings define the specific role of ASCC during ribosome-associated quality control and identify the molecular target of its activity.

Abstract: Sepsis and shock states impose mitochondrial stress, and in response, adaptive mechanisms such as fission, fusion and mitophagy are induced to eliminate damaged portions of or entire dysfunctional mitochondria. The mechanisms underlying these events are being elucidated; yet a direct link between loss of mitochondrial membrane potential ΔΨm and the initiation of fission, fusion and mitophagy remains to be well characterized. The direct association between the magnitude of the ΔΨm and the capacity for mitochondria to buffer Ca2+ renders Ca2+ uniquely suited as the signal engaging these mechanisms in circumstances of mitochondrial stress that lower the ΔΨm. Herein, we show that the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) IV mediates an adaptive slowing in oxidative respiration that minimizes oxidative stress in the kidneys of mice subjected to either cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis or endotoxemia. CaMKIV shifts the balance towards mitochondrial fission and away from fusion by 1) directly phosphorylating an activating Serine616 on the fission protein DRP1 and 2) reducing the expression of the fusion proteins Mfn1/2 and OPA-1. CaMKIV, through its function as a direct PINK1 kinase and regulator of Parkin expression, also enables mitophagy. These data support that CaMKIV serves as a keystone linking mitochondrial stress with the adaptive mechanisms of mitochondrial fission, fusion and mitophagy that mitigate oxidative stress in the kidneys of mice responding to sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
Ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons play roles in reward and aversion. We recently discovered that the VTA has neurons that co-transmit glutamate and GABA (glutamate-GABA co-transmitting neurons), transmit glutamate without GABA (glutamate-transmitting neurons), or transmit GABA without glutamate (GABA-transmitting neurons). However, the functions of these VTA cell types in motivated behavior are unclear. To identify the functions of these VTA cell types, we combine recombinase mouse lines with INTRSECT2.0 vectors to selectively target these neurons. We find that VTA cell types have unique signaling patterns for reward, aversion, and learned cues. Whereas VTA glutamate-transmitting neurons signal cues predicting reward, VTA GABA-transmitting neurons signal cues predicting the absence of reward, and glutamate-GABA co-transmitting neurons signal rewarding and aversive outcomes without signaling learned cues related to those outcomes. Thus, we demonstrate that genetically defined subclasses of VTA glutamate and GABA neurons signal different aspects of motivated behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical cues from the extracellular matrix (ECM) regulate various cellular processes via distinct mechanotransduction pathways. In breast cancer, increased ECM stiffness promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell invasion, and metastasis. Here, we identify a mechanosensitive EPHA2/LYN protein complex regulating EMT and metastasis in response to increasing ECM stiffness during tumor progression. High ECM stiffness leads to ligand-independent phosphorylation of ephrin receptor EPHA2, which recruits and activates the LYN kinase. LYN phosphorylates the EMT transcription factor TWIST1 to release TWIST1 from its cytoplasmic anchor G3BP2 to enter the nucleus, thus triggering EMT and invasion. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of this pathway prevents breast tumor invasion and metastasis in vivo. In human breast cancer samples, activation of this pathway correlates with collagen fiber alignment, a marker of increasing ECM stiffness. Our findings reveal an EPHA2/LYN/TWIST1 mechanotransduction pathway that responds to mechanical signals from the tumor microenvironment to drive EMT, invasion, and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplet (LD) formation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is accompanied by the targeting and accumulation of specific hydrophobic, membrane-embedded proteins on LDs. The determinants of this process are unknown. Here, we study the hydrophobic membrane motifs of two Drosophila melanogaster proteins, GPAT4 and ALG14, that utilize this pathway, and we identify crucial sequence features that mediate LD accumulation. Molecular dynamics simulations and studies in cells reveal that LD targeting of these motifs requires deeply inserted tryptophans that have lower free energy in the LD oil phase and positively charged residues near predicted hairpin hinges that become less constrained in the LD environment. Analyzing hydrophobic motifs from similar LD-targeting proteins, it appears that the distribution of tryptophan and positively charged residues distinguishes them from non-LD-targeting membrane motifs. Our studies identify specific sequence features and principles of hydrophobic membrane motifs that mediate their accumulation on LDs.

Abstract: Summary
Cell division in eukaryotes requires the regulated assembly of the spindle apparatus. The proper organization of microtubules within the spindle is driven by motor proteins that exert forces to slide filaments, whereas non-motor proteins crosslink filaments into higher-order motifs, such as overlapping bundles. It is not clear how active and passive forces are integrated to produce regulated mechanical outputs within spindles. Here, we employ simultaneous optical trapping and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to directly measure the frictional forces produced by the mitotic crosslinking protein PRC1 that resist microtubule sliding. These forces scale with microtubule sliding velocity and the number of PRC1 crosslinks but do not depend on overlap length or PRC1 density within overlaps. Our results suggest that PRC1 ensembles act similarly to a mechanical dashpot, producing significant resistance against fast motions but minimal resistance against slow motions, allowing for the integration of diverse motor activities into a single mechanical outcome.

Abstract: Summary
The liver is a key regulator of systemic energy homeostasis whose proper function is dependent on the circadian clock. Here, we show that livers deficient in the oscillator component JARID1a exhibit a dysregulation of genes involved in energy metabolism. Importantly, we find that mice that lack hepatic JARID1a have decreased lean body mass, decreased respiratory exchange ratios, faster production of ketones, and increased glucose production in response to fasting. Finally, we find that JARID1a loss compromises the response of the hepatic transcriptome to nutrient availability. In all, ablation of hepatic JARID1a disrupts the coordination of hepatic metabolic programs with whole-body consequences.

Abstract: Summary
Motile cells navigate complex environments by changing their direction of travel, generating left-right asymmetries in their mechanical subsystems to physically turn. Currently, little is known about how external directional cues are propagated along the length scale of the whole cell and integrated with its force-generating apparatus to steer migration mechanically. We examine the mechanics of spontaneous cell turning in fish epidermal keratocytes and find that the mechanical asymmetries responsible for turning behavior predominate at the rear of the cell, where there is asymmetric centripetal actin flow. Using experimental perturbations, we identify two linked feedback loops connecting myosin II contractility, adhesion strength and actin network flow in turning cells that are sufficient to explain the observed cell shapes and trajectories. Notably, asymmetries in actin polymerization at the cell leading edge play only a minor role in the mechanics of cell turning—that is, cells steer from the rear.

Abstract: Summary
Many animals fight for dominance between conspecifics. Because winners could obtain more resources than losers, fighting outcomes are important for the animal’s survival, especially in a situation with insufficient resources, such as hunger. However, it remains unclear whether and how hunger affects fighting outcomes. Herein, we investigate the effects of food deprivation on brain activity and fighting behaviors in zebrafish. We report that starvation induces winning in social conflicts. Before the fights, starved fish show potentiation of the lateral subregion of the dorsal habenula (dHbL)-dorsal/intermediate interpeduncular nucleus (d/iIPN) pathway, which is known to be essential for and potentiated after winning fights. Circuit potentiation is mediated by hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neuropeptides, which prolong AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) activity by increasing the expression of a flip type of alternative splicing variant of the AMPAR subunit. This mechanism may underlie how hungry vertebrates win fights and may be commonly shared across animal phylogeny.

Abstract: Summary
There remains an unmet need for preclinical models to enable personalized therapy for ovarian cancer (OC) patients. Here we evaluate the capacity of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) to predict clinical drug response and functional consequences of tumor heterogeneity. We included 36 whole-genome-characterized PDOs from 23 OC patients with known clinical histories. OC PDOs maintain the genomic features of the original tumor lesion and recapitulate patient response to neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel combination treatment. PDOs display inter- and intrapatient drug response heterogeneity to chemotherapy and targeted drugs, which can be partially explained by genetic aberrations. PDO drug screening identifies high responsiveness to at least one drug for 88% of patients. PDOs are valuable preclinical models that can provide insights into drug response for individual patients with OC, complementary to genetic testing. Generating PDOs of multiple tumor locations can improve clinical decision making and increase our knowledge of genetic and drug response heterogeneity.

Abstract: Summary
Cross-presentation of antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) is critical for initiation of anti-tumor immune responses. Yet, key steps involved in trafficking of antigens taken up by DCs remain incompletely understood. Here, we screen 700 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and identify 37 enhancers of antigen import from endolysosomes into the cytosol. To reveal their mechanism of action, we generate proteomic organellar maps of control and drug-treated DCs (focusing on two compounds, prazosin and tamoxifen). By combining organellar mapping, quantitative proteomics, and microscopy, we conclude that import enhancers undergo lysosomal trapping leading to membrane permeation and antigen release. Enhancing antigen import facilitates cross-presentation of soluble and cell-associated antigens. Systemic administration of prazosin leads to reduced growth of MC38 tumors and to a synergistic effect with checkpoint immunotherapy in a melanoma model. Thus, inefficient antigen import into the cytosol limits antigen cross-presentation, restraining the potency of anti-tumor immune responses and efficacy of checkpoint blockers.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with cancer may be at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the role of viral load on this risk is unknown. We measured SARS-CoV-2 viral load using cycle threshold (CT) values from reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays applied to nasopharyngeal swab specimens in 100 patients with cancer and 2,914 without cancer who were admitted to three New York City hospitals. Overall, the in-hospital mortality rate was 38.8% among patients with a high viral load, 24.1% among patients with a medium viral load, and 15.3% among patients with a low viral load (p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in patients with cancer (high, 45.2% mortality; medium, 28.0%; low, 12.1%; p = 0.008). Patients with hematologic malignancies had higher median viral loads (CT = 25.0) than patients without cancer (CT = 29.2; p = 0.0039). SARS-CoV-2 viral load results may offer vital prognostic information for patients with and without cancer who are hospitalized with COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with few therapeutic options. The disease presents with a complex spectrum of genomic aberrations, but the pharmacological consequences of these aberrations are partly unknown. Here, we report an integrated pharmacogenomic analysis of 100 patient-derived GBM cell cultures from the human glioma cell culture (HGCC) cohort. Exploring 1,544 drugs, we find that GBM has two main pharmacological subgroups, marked by differential response to proteasome inhibitors and mutually exclusive aberrations in TP53 and CDKN2A/B. We confirm this trend in cell and in xenotransplantation models, and identify both Bcl-2 family inhibitors and p53 activators as potentiators of proteasome inhibitors in GBM cells. We can further predict the responses of individual cell cultures to several existing drug classes, presenting opportunities for drug repurposing and design of stratified trials. Our functionally profiled biobank provides a valuable resource for the discovery of new treatments for GBM.

Abstract: Summary
T cell recognition of peptides presented by human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) is mediated by the highly variable T cell receptor (TCR). Despite this built-in TCR variability, individuals can mount immune responses against viral epitopes by using identical or highly related TCRs expressed on CD8+ T cells. Characterization of these TCRs has extended our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the recognition of peptide-HLA. However, few examples exist for CD4+ T cells. Here, we investigate CD4+ T cell responses to the internal proteins of the influenza A virus that correlate with protective immunity. We identify five internal epitopes that are commonly recognized by CD4+ T cells in five HLA-DR1+ subjects and show conservation across viral strains and zoonotic reservoirs. TCR repertoire analysis demonstrates several shared gene usage biases underpinned by complementary biochemical features evident in a structural comparison. These epitopes are attractive targets for vaccination and other T cell therapies.

Abstract: Summary
C.neoformans Dnmt5 is an unusually specific maintenance-type CpG methyltransferase (DNMT) that mediates long-term epigenome evolution. It harbors a DNMT domain and SNF2 ATPase domain. We find that the SNF2 domain couples substrate specificity to an ATPase step essential for DNA methylation. Coupling occurs independent of nucleosomes. Hemimethylated DNA preferentially stimulates ATPase activity, and mutating Dnmt5’s ATP-binding pocket disproportionately reduces ATPase stimulation by hemimethylated versus unmethylated substrates. Engineered DNA substrates that stabilize a reaction intermediate by mimicking a “flipped-out” conformation of the target cytosine bypass the SNF2 domain’s requirement for hemimethylation. This result implies that ATP hydrolysis by the SNF2 domain is coupled to the DNMT domain conformational changes induced by preferred substrates. These findings establish a new role for a SNF2 ATPase: controlling an adjoined enzymatic domain’s substrate recognition and catalysis. We speculate that this coupling contributes to the exquisite specificity of Dnmt5 via mechanisms related to kinetic proofreading.

Abstract: Summary
The neuronal protein complexin contains multiple domains that exert clamping and facilitatory functions to tune spontaneous and action potential-triggered synaptic release. We address the clamping mechanism and show that the accessory helix of complexin arrests assembly of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex that forms the core machinery of intracellular membrane fusion. In a reconstituted fusion assay, site- and stage-specific photo-cross-linking reveals that, prior to fusion, the complexin accessory helix laterally binds the membrane-proximal C-terminal ends of SNAP25 and VAMP2. Corresponding complexin interface mutants selectively increase spontaneous release of neurotransmitters in living neurons, implying that the accessory helix suppresses final zippering/assembly of the SNARE four-helix bundle by restraining VAMP2 and SNAP25.

Abstract: Summary
We analyze the transcriptome of baseline and on-therapy tumor biopsies from 101 patients with advanced melanoma treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) alone or combined with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4). We find that T cell infiltration and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling signatures correspond most highly with clinical response to therapy, with a reciprocal decrease in cell-cycle and WNT signaling pathways in responding biopsies. We model the interaction in 58 human cell lines, where IFN-γ in vitro exposure leads to a conserved transcriptome response unless cells have IFN-γ receptor alterations. This conserved IFN-γ transcriptome response in melanoma cells serves to amplify the antitumor immune response. Therefore, the magnitude of the antitumor T cell response and the corresponding downstream IFN-γ signaling are the main drivers of clinical response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Plant stress responses involve dynamic growth regulation. Growth is restricted in harsh environmental conditions and is rapidly restored when conditions improve. Here, we identified BIN2, a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-like kinase, as a molecular switch in the transition to robust growth after salt stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the rapid recovery phase after salt stress, the calcium sensors SOS3 and SCaBP8 perceive a calcium signal and promote BIN2 localization to the plasma membrane to repress the salt stress response, and BIN2 inhibits SOS2 activity and enhances growth by releasing BZR1/BES1 transcriptional activity. The expression of stress- and brassinosteroid-responsive genes is coordinately regulated during this process. bin2-3bil1 and bin2-3bil2 mutants defective in BIN2 and its homologs BIL1 and BIL2, respectively, are hyposensitive to salt stress. Our study suggests that salt signaling modulates the subcellular localization and interactions of BIN2. By phosphorylating different substrates, BIN2 regulates the salt stress response and growth recovery.

Abstract: Summary
CARMILs are large, multidomain, membrane-associated proteins that regulate actin assembly and Rho-family GTPases, but their role in inflammatory signaling is not defined. Tandem mass tag mass spectrometry indicated that, in fibroblasts, CARMIL1 associates with interleukin (IL)-1 signaling molecules. Immunoprecipitation of cells transfected with CARMIL1 mutants showed that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region of CARMIL1 associates with IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). Knockout of CARMIL1 by CRISPR-Cas9 reduced IL-1-induced ERK activation by 72% and MMP3 expression by 40%. Compared with CARMIL1 wild-type (WT), cells expressing mutant CARMIL1 lacking its LRR domain exhibited 45% lower ERK activation and 40% lower MMP3 expression. In fibroblasts transduced with a cell-permeable, TAT CARMIL1 peptide that competed with IL-1R1 and IRAK binding to the LRR of CARMIL1, collagen degradation was reduced by 43%. As the LRR of CARMIL1 evidently regulates IL-1 signaling, CARMIL1 could become a target for anti-inflammatory drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Balanced stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we identified the transcription factor SRY-related HMG-box (Sox) 100B, which is orthologous to mammalian Sox8/9/10, as a common target and central mediator of the EGFR/Ras and JAK/STAT signaling pathways that coordinates intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and differentiation during both normal epithelial homeostasis and stress-induced intestinal repair in Drosophila. The two stress-responsive pathways directly regulate Sox100B transcription via two separate enhancers. Interestingly, an appropriate level of Sox100B is critical for its function, as its depletion inhibits ISC proliferation via cell cycle arrest, while its overexpression also inhibits ISC proliferation by directly suppressing EGFR expression and additionally promotes ISC differentiation by activating a differentiation-promoting regulatory circuitry composed of Sox100B, Sox21a, and Pdm1. Thus, our study reveals a Sox family transcription factor that functions as a stress-responsive signaling nexus that ultimately controls tissue homeostasis and regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Cell proliferation changes concomitantly with fate transitions during reprogramming, differentiation, regeneration, and oncogenesis. Methods to resolve cell cycle length heterogeneity in real time are currently lacking. Here, we describe a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter that captures live-cell cycle speed using a single measurement. This reporter is based on the color-changing fluorescent timer (FT) protein, which emits blue fluorescence when newly synthesized before maturing into a red fluorescent protein. We generated a mouse strain expressing an H2B-FT fusion reporter from a universally active locus and demonstrate that faster cycling cells can be distinguished from slower cycling ones on the basis of the intracellular fluorescence ratio between the FT’s blue and red states. Using this reporter, we reveal the native cell cycle speed distributions of fresh hematopoietic cells and demonstrate its utility in analyzing cell proliferation in solid tissues. This system is broadly applicable for dissecting functional heterogeneity associated with cell cycle dynamics in complex tissues.

Abstract: We designed experiments to assess whether fungal cell wall mannans function as an immune shield or an immune agonist. Fungal cell wall β-(1,3)-glucan normally plays a major and dominant role in immune activation. The outer mannan layer has been variously described as an immune shield, because it has the potential to mask the underlying β-(1,3)-glucan, or an immune activator, as it also has the potential to engage with a wide range of mannose detecting PRRs. To resolve this conundrum we examined species-specific differences in host immune recognition in the och1Δ N-mannosylation-deficient mutant background in four species of yeast-like fungi. Irrespective of the fungal species, the cytokine response (TNFα and IL-6) induced by the och1Δ mutants in human monocytes was reduced compared to that of the wild type. In contrast, TNFα production induced by och1Δ was increased, relative to wild type, due to increased β-glucan exposure, when mouse or human macrophages were used. These observations suggest that N-mannan is not a major PAMP for macrophages and that in these cells mannan does shield the fungus from recognition of the inner cell wall β-glucan. However, N-mannan is a significant inducer of cytokine for monocytes. Therefore the metaphor of the fungal “mannan shield” can only be applied to some, but not all, myeloid cells used in immune profiling experiments of fungal species.

Abstract: Summary
Immune cell function depends on specific metabolic programs dictated by mitochondria, including nutrient oxidation, macromolecule synthesis, and post-translational modifications. Mitochondrial adaptations have been linked to acute and chronic inflammation, but the metabolic cues and precise mechanisms remain unclear. Here we reveal that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is essential for shaping mitochondrial adaptations for IL-1β production in macrophages through non-histone deacetylation. In vivo, HDAC3 promoted lipopolysaccharide-induced acute inflammation and high-fat diet-induced chronic inflammation by enhancing NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation. HDAC3 configured the lipid profile in stimulated macrophages and restricted fatty acid oxidation (FAO) supported by exogenous fatty acids for mitochondria to acquire their adaptations and depolarization. Rather than affecting nuclear gene expression, HDAC3 translocated to mitochondria to deacetylate and inactivate an FAO enzyme, mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme subunit α. HDAC3 may serve as a controlling node that balances between acquiring mitochondrial adaptations and sustaining their fitness for IL-1β-dependent inflammation.

Abstract: Although human brain represents only 2% of the body mass, it uses around 20 % of the organism energy. Due to the brain’s limited energy storage, the oxygen and glucose necessary to support brain functions depends on the correct blood supply. The main components of the arteries are smooth muscle cells, which are considered the main regulators of vascular tone and blood flow distribution. The information currently available on the functioning of the cerebral arteries and their cell constituents is extremely scarce. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop an in vitro model of smooth muscle cells derived from rat middle cerebral artery. Explants were collected from rat middle cerebral artery and adhered to collagen-coated culture dishes. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that the cells present in the culture expressed α-actin, a protein characteristic of the contractile phenotype of these cells. In addition, these cells did not express the endothelial marker, vWF. To evaluate the functionality of these cells the response to contractile agents, serotonin and noradrenaline, and to relaxing agent, sodium nitroprusside was determine by Planar Cell Surface Area analysis. Together the data obtained show that the cell culture obtained through the procedure described resulted in cells presenting the markers characteristic of smooth muscle cells and maintaining the usual contractile response, indicating that the cells obtained through this may be used as a model for characterization and study of functional behavior of the middle cerebral artery, as well as interaction studies between vascular and neuronal system.

Abstract: Summary
We address whether combinations with a pan-RAF inhibitor (RAFi) would be effective in KRAS mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Chemical library and CRISPR genetic screens identify combinations causing apoptotic anti-tumor activity. The most potent combination, concurrent inhibition of RAF (RAFi) and ERK (ERKi), is highly synergistic at low doses in cell line, organoid, and rat models of PDAC, whereas each inhibitor alone is only cytostatic. Comprehensive mechanistic signaling studies using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) pathway mapping and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) show that RAFi/ERKi induced insensitivity to loss of negative feedback and system failures including loss of ERK signaling, FOSL1, and MYC; shutdown of the MYC transcriptome; and induction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. We conclude that low-dose vertical inhibition of the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade is an effective therapeutic strategy for KRAS mutant PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
Protein ensembles control genome function by establishing, maintaining, and deconstructing cell-type-specific chromosomal landscapes. A plethora of small molecules orchestrate cellular functions and therefore may link physiological processes with genome biology. The metabolic enzyme and hemoglobin cofactor heme induces proteolysis of a transcriptional repressor, Bach1, and regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally. However, whether heme controls genome function broadly or through prescriptive actions is unclear. Using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), we establish a heme-dependent chromatin atlas in wild-type and mutant erythroblasts lacking enhancers that confer normal heme synthesis. Amalgamating chromatin landscapes and transcriptomes in cells with sub-physiological heme and post-heme rescue reveals parallel Bach1-dependent and Bach1-independent mechanisms that target heme-sensing chromosomal hotspots. The hotspots harbor a DNA motif demarcating heme-regulated chromatin and genes encoding proteins not known to be heme regulated, including metabolic enzymes. The heme-omics analysis establishes how an essential biochemical cofactor controls genome function and cellular physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with social and communicative disabilities. The cellular and circuit mechanisms by which loss of neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) results in social deficits are unknown. Here, we identify social behavioral dysregulation with Nf1 loss in Drosophila. These deficits map to primary dysfunction of a group of peripheral sensory neurons. Nf1 regulation of Ras signaling in adult ppk23+ chemosensory cells is required for normal social behaviors in flies. Loss of Nf1 attenuates ppk23+ neuronal activity in response to pheromones, and circuit-specific manipulation of Nf1 expression or neuronal activity in ppk23+ neurons rescues social deficits. This disrupted sensory processing gives rise to persistent changes in behavior beyond the social interaction, indicating a sustained effect of an acute sensory misperception. Together our data identify a specific circuit mechanism through which Nf1 regulates social behaviors and suggest social deficits in NF1 arise from propagation of sensory misinformation.

Abstract: Summary
Recent breakthroughs in neuroanatomical tracing methods have helped unravel complicated neural connectivity in whole-brain tissue at single-cell resolution. However, in most cases, analysis of brain images remains dependent on highly subjective and sample-specific manual processing, preventing precise comparison across sample animals. In the present study, we introduce AMaSiNe, software for automated mapping of single neurons in the standard mouse brain atlas with annotated regions. AMaSiNe automatically calibrates misaligned and deformed slice samples to locate labeled neuronal positions from multiple brain samples into the standardized 3D Allen Mouse Brain Reference Atlas. We exploit the high fidelity and reliability of AMaSiNe to investigate the topographic structures of feedforward projections from the lateral geniculate nucleus to the primary visual area by reconstructing rabies-virus-injected brain slices in 3D space. Our results demonstrate that distinct organization of neural projections can be precisely mapped using AMaSiNe.

Abstract: Summary
Many membraneless organelles form through liquid-liquid phase separation, but how their size is controlled and whether size is linked to function remain poorly understood. The histone locus body (HLB) is an evolutionarily conserved nuclear body that regulates the transcription and processing of histone mRNAs. Here, we show that Drosophila HLBs form through phase separation. During embryogenesis, the size of HLBs is controlled in a precise and dynamic manner that is dependent on the cell cycle and zygotic histone gene activation. Control of HLB growth is achieved by a mechanism integrating nascent mRNAs at the histone locus, which facilitates phase separation, and the nuclear concentration of the scaffold protein multi-sex combs (Mxc), which is controlled by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. Reduced Cdk2 activity results in smaller HLBs and the appearance of nascent, misprocessed histone mRNAs. Thus, our experiments identify a mechanism linking nuclear body growth and size with gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
The factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.

Abstract: Summary
Lung alveolar epithelium is composed of alveolar type I (AT1) and type II (AT2) cells. AT1 cells mediate gas exchange, whereas AT2 cells act as progenitor cells to repair injured alveoli. Lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs) play a crucial but still poorly understood role in regulating alveolar repair. Here, we studied the role of the LMVEC-derived bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in promoting alveolar repair using mice with endothelial-specific deletion of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1), the key enzyme promoting S1P generation. These mutant lungs developed airspace-enlargement lesions and exhibited a reduced number of AT1 cells after Pseudomonas-aeruginosa-induced lung injury. We demonstrated that S1P released by LMVECs acted via its receptor, S1PR2, on AT2 cells and induced nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein (YAP), a regulator of AT2 to AT1 transition. Thus, angiocrine S1P released after injury acts via the S1PR2-YAP signaling axis on AT2 cells to promote AT2 to AT1 differentiation required for alveolar repair.

Abstract: Summary
Astrocytes represent central regulators of brain glucose metabolism and neuronal function. They have recently been shown to adapt their function in response to alterations in nutritional state through responding to the energy state-sensing hormones leptin and insulin. Here, we demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 inhibits glucose uptake and promotes β-oxidation in cultured astrocytes. Conversely, postnatal GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) deletion in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing astrocytes impairs astrocyte mitochondrial integrity and activates an integrated stress response with enhanced fibroblast growth factor (FGF)21 production and increased brain glucose uptake. Accordingly, central neutralization of FGF21 or astrocyte-specific FGF21 inactivation abrogates the improvements in glucose tolerance and learning in mice lacking GLP-1R expression in astrocytes. Collectively, these experiments reveal a role for astrocyte GLP-1R signaling in maintaining mitochondrial integrity, and lack of GLP-1R signaling mounts an adaptive stress response resulting in an improvement of systemic glucose homeostasis and memory formation.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of different cell types, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs). How these cells interact and contribute to lung carcinogenesis remains elusive. Using G12DKRAS- and V600EBRAF-driven mouse lung models, we identify the pleiotropic glycoprotein stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) as a regulator of TAM-TAF interactions. STC1 is secreted by TAFs and suppresses TAM differentiation, at least in part, by sequestering the binding of GRP94, an autocrine macrophage-differentiation-inducing factor, to its cognate scavenger receptors. The accumulation of mature TAMs in the Stc1-deficient lung leads to enhanced secretion of TGF-β1 and, thus, TAF accumulation in the TME. Consistent with the mouse data, in human lung adenocarcinoma, STC1 expression is restricted to myofibroblasts, and a significant increase of naive macrophages is detected in STC1-high compared with STC1-low cases. This work increases our understanding of lung adenocarcinoma development and suggests new approaches for therapeutic targeting of the TME.

Abstract: Summary
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurogenetic disorder that leads to elevated mechanistic targeting of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity. Cilia can be affected by mTORC1 signaling, and ciliary deficits are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we examine whether neuronal cilia are affected in TSC. We show that cortical tubers from TSC patients and mutant mouse brains have fewer cilia. Using high-content image-based assays, we demonstrate that mTORC1 activity inversely correlates with ciliation in TSC1/2-deficient neurons. To investigate the mechanistic relationship between mTORC1 and cilia, we perform a phenotypic screen for mTORC1 inhibitors with TSC1/2-deficient neurons. We identify inhibitors of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) that suppress mTORC1 through regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 rescues ciliation through downregulation of Hsp27. Our study uncovers the heat-shock machinery as a druggable signaling node to restore mTORC1 activity and cilia due to loss of TSC1/2, and it provides broadly applicable platforms for studying TSC-related neuronal dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2/ANTXR2) is a cell surface receptor for both collagen VI and anthrax toxin. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CMG2 lead to a severe condition, hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (HFS). We have here dissected a network of dynamic interactions between CMG2 and various actin interactors and regulators, describing a different behavior from other extracellular matrix receptors. CMG2 binds talin, and thereby the actin cytoskeleton, only in its ligand-free state. Extracellular ligand binding leads to src-dependent talin release and recruitment of the actin cytoskeleton regulator RhoA and its effectors. These sequential interactions of CMG2 are necessary for the control of oriented cell division during fish development. Finally, we demonstrate that effective switching between talin and RhoA binding is required for the intracellular degradation of collagen VI in human fibroblasts, which explains why HFS mutations in the cytoskeleton-binding domain lead to dysregulation of extracellular matrix homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The function of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in transcriptional regulation remains obscure. By analyzing the genome-wide nascent transcript profiles in breast cancer cells, we identify a special group of eRNAs that are essential for estrogen-induced transcriptional repression. Using eRNAs of TM4SF1 and EFEMP1 as the paradigms, we find that these RNA molecules not only stabilize promoter-enhancer interactions but also recruit liganded estrogen receptor α (ERα) to particular enhancer regions, facilitate the formation of a functional transcriptional complex, and cause gene silencing. Interestingly, ERα is shown to directly bind with eRNAs by its DNA-binding domain. These eRNAs help with the formation of a specific ERα-centered transcriptional complex and promote the association of the histone demethylase KDM2A, which dismisses RNA polymerase II from designated enhancers and suppresses the transcription of target genes. Our work demonstrates a complete mechanism underlying the action of eRNAs in modulating and refining the locus-specific transcriptional program.

Abstract: Summary
As three-dimensional cell culture formats gain in popularity, there emerges a need for tools that produce vast amounts of data on individual cells within the spheroids or organoids. Here, we present a microfluidic platform that provides access to such data by parallelizing the manipulation of individual spheroids within anchored droplets. Different conditions can be applied in a single device by triggering the merging of new droplets with the spheroid-containing drops. This allows cell-cell interactions to be initiated for building microtissues, studying stem cells’ self-organization, or observing antagonistic interactions. It also allows the spheroids’ physical or chemical environment to be modulated, as we show by applying a drug over a large range of concentrations in a single parallelized experiment. This convergence of microfluidics and image acquisition leads to a data-driven approach that allows the heterogeneity of 3D culture behavior to be addressed across the scales, bridging single-cell measurements with population measurements.

Abstract: Summary
Durable humoral immunity against epidemic infectious disease requires the survival of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). LLPC longevity is dependent on metabolic programs distinct from short-lived plasma cells (SLPCs); however, the mechanistic basis for this difference is unclear. We have previously shown that CD28, the prototypic T cell costimulatory receptor, is expressed on both LLPCs and SLPCs but is essential only for LLPC survival. Here we show that CD28 transduces pro-survival signaling specifically in LLPCs through differential SLP76 expression. CD28 signaling in LLPCs increased glucose uptake, mitochondrial mass/respiration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Unexpectedly, CD28-mediated regulation of mitochondrial respiration, NF-κB activation, and survival was ROS dependent. IRF4, a target of NF-κB, was upregulated by CD28 activation in LLPCs and decreased IRF4 levels correlated with decreased glucose uptake, mitochondrial mass, ROS, and CD28-mediated survival. Altogether, these data demonstrate that CD28 signaling induces a ROS-dependent metabolic program required for LLPC survival.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome assembly is driven by numerous assembly factors, including the Rix1 complex and the AAA ATPase Rea1. These two assembly factors catalyze 60S maturation at two distinct states, triggering poorly understood large-scale structural transitions that we analyzed by cryo-electron microscopy. Two nuclear pre-60S intermediates were discovered that represent previously unknown states after Rea1-mediated removal of the Ytm1-Erb1 complex and reveal how the L1 stalk develops from a pre-mature nucleolar to a mature-like nucleoplasmic state. A later pre-60S intermediate shows how the central protuberance arises, assisted by the nearby Rix1-Rea1 machinery, which was solved in its pre-ribosomal context to molecular resolution. This revealed a Rix12-Ipi32 tetramer anchored to the pre-60S via Ipi1, strategically positioned to monitor this decisive remodeling. These results are consistent with a general underlying principle that temporarily stabilized immature RNA domains are successively remodeled by assembly factors, thereby ensuring failsafe assembly progression.
