Abstract: In this study, we demonstrated the effective morphological control of polymer:fullerene blends using three separate solvent systems: chloroform (CF), CF:1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and CF:o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). The polymer:fullerene blends are composed of two diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymers of P(DPP-alt-QT) and P(DPP-alt-DTBSe) and a fullerene derivative of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), i.e., P(DPP-alt-QT):PC71BM or P(DPP-alt-DTBSe):PC71BM. The CF:ODCB binary solvent exhibited the best photovoltaic performance among the three solvent systems for both polymer-based devices, although the CF:DIO also exhibited an improved performance compared to the CF system. By examining film morphology of the blend films, we found that the CF:ODCB enabled the most optimal nanoscale phase separation and the morphological features were strongly affected by the solubility of each material in the high boiling-point (BP) solvent. Specifically, the polymers have limited but slightly higher solubility in ODCB than in DIO, while the PC71BM molecules have a high solubility in both DIO and ODCB. Therefore, this work highlights that the optimally asymmetric solubility of each photoactive component in the high BP solvent is a critical factor to form the nanoscale, bicontinuous domains in the blend films and thereby to determine the performance of photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: A numerical process is developed on a Transfer-Matrix Method (TMM) to calculate the optical properties of multilayers involved in thin film solar cells. Using the bulk complex refractive indices in a considered spectral range for each material allows us to calculate the transmittance of the whole structure and the intrinsic absorption inside the sole active layer. An optical optimization of oxide|metal|oxide trilayer electrode in the air and with a (poly-3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) bulk heterojunction based organic solar cell is performed. The ZnO|Ag|ZnO structure is specifically studied in order to avoid the use of indium in such photovoltaic components.

Abstract: Absorber layers consisting of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) and surface ZnSe in variable ratios were prepared by selenization of electroplated Cu/Sn/Zn precursors and completed into full devices with up to 5.6% power conversion efficiency. The loss of short circuit current density for samples with increasing ZnSe content is consistent with an overall reduction of spectral response, pointing to a ZnSe current blocking behavior. A feature in the spectral response centered around 3eV was identified and attributed to light absorption by ZnSe. A model is proposed to account for additional collection of the carriers generated underneath ZnSe capable of diffusing across to the space charge region. The model satisfactorily reproduces the shape of the spectral response and the estimated ZnSe surface coverage is in good qualitative agreement with analysis of the Raman spectral mapping. The model emphasizes the importance of the ZnSe morphology on the spectral response, and its consequences on the solar cell device performance.

Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) from Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films fabricated by a sputtering-sulfurization method with considerably different Cu/(Zn+Sn) ratios of 0.60–4.21 and Zn/Sn ratios of 0.29–1.68 was investigated with respect to the defect physics. The ranges include the Cu-poor and Zn-rich (Cu/(Zn+Sn)= 0.78 and Zn/Sn=1.55) CZTS composition, which is determined as a suitable composition for application as a solar cell absorber. The origins of the luminescence are attributed to band-to-impurity (BI), band-to-tail (BT), and band-to-band (BB) recombinations at approximately 1.23, 1.35, and 1.48eV, respectively, which are typically observed from heavily doped and highly compensated semiconductors as a result of temperature dependence, excitation power dependence, and spectral shapes of the PL spectra. Although the BT and BB band emissions had no strong dependence on the film compositions, an intense BI band emission was dependent on the film composition and observed for Cu/Sn≤2.0. The compositional dependence indicates that a deep acceptor level is formed in CZTS with Cu/Sn≤2.0, which is thus considered to be a suitable composition range for the absorber of a highly efficient solar cell.

Abstract: In this paper, we designed a flexible electroreflective device (ERD) with tunable optical properties in the near and mid infrared spectra. The ERD is made of a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) layer interpenetrated in a soft and flexible nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR)/polyethylene oxide (PEO) interpenetrating polymer network (IPN). The composition, structure and infrared properties of the semi-IPN were optimized according to the polymerization time of the EDOT monomer within the IPN. After the addition of an ionic liquid (IL), namely N-ethylmethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI), assuming the ionic conductivity of the system, the device exhibits middle infrared and tunable optical properties between 2µm and 20µm upon electrical switching between −1.5V and +1.5V. The modulation of the reflectivity in bands II (3–5µm) and III (8–12µm) regions is 26% and 41% respectively. Due to the presence of the soft NBR network, both IPN and ERD reveal improved mechanical properties compare to the single network and the ERD-only based on PEO. For instance, ERDs made with PEO/PEDOT semi-IPN possesses an elongation at break below 10%, for a stress at break lower than 1.4MPa, while ERDs containing NBR show elongations at break from 45% to 15% for stresses at break from 3 to 8MPa, depending on the amount of incorporated PEDOT. In parallel, the NBR/PEO/PEDOT devices showed robust and flexible behavior.

Abstract: The evolution of dislocation clusters in High Performance Multicrystalline Silicon was studied by means of photoluminescence imaging, defect etching and Electron Backscatter Diffraction. Cluster height was found to increase as function of lateral size. The largest clusters were found to exist in twinned grains or spanning multiple grains. Dislocation clusters were seen to originate at CSL boundaries and terminate at random angle grain boundaries. It is suggested that termination, as well as generation of dislocation clusters are growth phenomena, which are controlled by the dislocations following the growth front, and that the successful termination of dislocation clusters is a simple function of distance between grain boundaries able to terminate the dislocations at the growth front. It is also suggested that crystal orientation may influence the mechanism through the ability of dislocation clusters to traverse the grain laterally from a generation to a termination site.

Abstract: The plastic crystal, namely succinonitrile (SN), has been incorporated with a UV-cured ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) polymer to form a transparent, self-standing polymeric crystal composite electrolyte (PCCE). The PCCE, containing cross-linked polymer ETPTA and SN with 0.1M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4), is proposed as the solid polymer electrolyte for electrochromic application. The weight ratio of ETPTA/SN is controlled at 85/15. Under a UV-exposure time of 30s, the PCCE turns into a transparent solid with an excellent interfacial adhesion between two electrochromic thin films. The chosen anodic and cathodic coloring materials are polyaniline-carbon nanotubes (PANIs-CNT) and poly(butyl viologen) (PBV) thin films, respectively. The PANI/PCCE/PBV solid-state ECD exhibits two stages of color change, with the first stage redox reaction occuring between −1.0 and 0.5V (PANI-CNTs vs. PBV) and the second stage occurs between 0.5 and 1.5V. At 550nm, the solid-state ECD shows a transmittance change of 39% and a coloration efficiency of 151.3cm2/C, respectively. The transmittance of the ECD at 550nm can be changed reversibly from 54% (bleached) to 15% (darkened) with the applied potentials of −2.0 and 0.75V, respectively. Electrochemical and electrochromic properties of the ECD are studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and UV–vis-NIR spectroscopy.

Abstract: The effect of two-step annealing, including solvent annealing and further-step thermal annealing on the inverted ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs), which are composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM):2,4-bis[4-(N,N-diisobutylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl] squaraine (SQ), was systematically investigated. The film morphology of ternary blends was characterized by X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscope. The results showed that a dramatic enhancement of power conversion efficiency from 1.32% to 4.42% was obtained due to the improved light harvesting, optimized self-assembled morphology and thermally induced crystallization of ternary blends. Especially, the optimized temperature of the thermal annealing process was remarkably decreased to 80°C. It was also found that the two-step annealing process was crucial in achieving high performance, which could not only control the domain size of SQ but also maintain a well-ordered nanoscale structure within the ternary blends of P3HT:PC71BM:SQ.

Abstract: By using transient-capacitance techniques we probe the mechanism of hole transport in amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells. The devices are formed by depositing undoped amorphous silicon followed by p-type amorphous silicon on n-type crystalline silicon wafers. The capacitance transients indicate that hole transport from p-type amorphous silicon to n-type crystalline silicon is hindered by hole accumulation in the depletion region of the crystalline silicon. The results are explained with a model based on electrostatic repulsion owing to hole build-up at the crystalline/amorphous interface. We apply these results to other heterojunction solar cells.

Abstract: Protein tyrosine phosphatse interacting protein (PTPIP51) is involved in the modulation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Up to now, less is known about the regulation of this modulation. A recent study hinted to the phosphorylation status of PTPIP51 being essential for correct regulation of PTPIP51 function. In this study we investigate the phosphorylation status of PTPIP51 under the inhibition of the main interacting kinases and phosphatases of PTPIP51. c-Src was inhibited by Dasatinib, EGF receptor by Gefitinib, protein kinase C by staurosporine, protein kinase A by RpcAMPs and PTP1B by its specific inhibitor. Furthermore, a combination of PP2 with Gefitinib and RpcAMPs was used, respectively. The data were acquired for non-EGF and EGF treated HaCaT cells. All cells were analyzed relative to the subcellular distribution and change in the amount of tyrosine 176 phosphorylated PTPIP51. Furthermore, the protein interactions were assayed by duolink proximity ligation assay. HaCaT cells submitted to the respective inhibitor displayed a subcellular redistribution of tyrosine 176 phosphorylated PTPIP51 depending on the applied inhibitor. Yet, the amount of tyrosine 176 phosphorylated PTPIP51 remained unchanged by inhibitor treatment except for Gefitinib and simultaneous PP2 and Gefitnib treatment in non EGF-stimulated cells, but was elevated if cells were also EGF stimulated, in control and inhibitor treated cells. Interestingly, the interaction with EGFR, 14-3-3, Raf-1, c-Src, PTP1B, PKA and PKC was influenced by the application of inhibitors. Also EGF application resulted in a sharp drop of the PTPIP51 interaction with the MAPK pathway (e.g. Raf-1) in the control group. Summarizing these new findings, we postulate that PTPIP51 is regulated by its phosphorylation status combined with a thereby induced subcellular redistribution. In addition, the EGF receptor regulates PTPIP51 interaction with Raf-1 by its phosphorylation, thus preventing an overshooting activation of the MAPK pathway.

Abstract: A 75kg solar-grade boron-doped silicon (Si) ingot has been directionally solidified in a Vertical Gradient Freeze (VGF)-type G2-sized furnace equipped with KRISTMAG® Heater Magnet Module (HMM). Alternating Magnetic Fields (AMFs) were used to enhance melt stirring and to control the growth interface morphology and shape. This as-grown multicrystalline (mc)-silicon ingot of 384×384×230mm3 in volume was cut into 4 bricks and in Vertical Cuts (VC) to analyze the material and to produce solar cells. Numerical simulations have been performed in order to optimize mass transport processes. Information about the curvature of the liquid–solid interface, the distribution of carbon (C) and oxygen (O), the content of Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Silicon Nitride (Si3N4)-particles and the electrical activity of defects were obtained from the ingot core. Except for the last-to-freeze part, a primarily inclusion-free ingot was solidified. Minority carrier lifetimes of τ~4µs were measured on the grinded as-cut surface. The concentrations of C and O were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to (0.4–7.9)×1017 atoms/cm3 and (0.3–5.4)×1017 atoms/cm3, respectively. Solar cells were produced from wafers at the Meyer Burger Roth & Rau Technology and Research Centre using the Meyer Burger Roth & Rau Passivated Emitter Rear Cell (PERC) process. Solar cell efficiencies were achieved between 17.7% and 18.0%.

Abstract: The histo blood group carbohydrate Sda antigen and its cognate biosynthetic enzyme B4GALNT2 show the highest level of expression in normal colon. Their dramatic down regulation previously observed in colon cancer tissues could play a role in the concomitant elevation of the selectin ligand sLex, involved in metastasis. However, down regulation of sLex expression by B4GALNT2 has been so far demonstrated in vitro, but not in tissues. The human B4GALNT2 gene specifies at least two transcripts, diverging in the first exon, never studied in normal and cancer tissues. The long form contains a 253 nt exon 1L; the short form contains a 38 nt exon 1S. Using qPCR, we showed that cell lines and normal or cancerous colon, expressed almost exclusively the short form, while the long form was mainly expressed by the embryonic colon fibroblast cell line CCD112CoN. Immunochemistry approaches using colon cancer cells permanently expressing either B4GALNT2 cDNAs as controls, led to the observation of several protein isoforms in human normal and cancerous colon, and cell lines. We showed that tissues expressing B4GALNT2 protein isoforms were able to induce Sda and to inhibit sLex expression; both of which are expressed mainly on PNGase F-insensitive carbohydrate chains. Concomitant expression of B4GALNT2 and siRNA-mediated inhibition of FUT6, the major fucosyltransferase involved in sLex synthesis in colon, resulted in a cumulative inhibition of sLex. In normal colon samples a significant relationship between sLex expression and the ratio between FUT6/B4GALNT2 activities exists, demonstrating for the first time a role for B4GALNT2 in sLex inhibition in vivo.

Abstract: CuInSe2(CIS)-based thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technology is recognized as a second-generation thin-film PV technology and its module efficiency has currently reached a level comparable to that of the market-dominant wafer-based polycrystalline-Si PV technology. Solar Frontier K.K. (SFKK) employs not only non-Si PV, but also Cd-free and Pb-free concepts in its products. Based on this concept, SFKK has already moved to the Giga-watt production stage in 2011. In this paper, current status and future prospects of SFKK are reviewed.

Abstract: We have investigated the role of the nitrogen content, the growth parameters, and the annealing processes involved in molecular beam epitaxy of GaInNAs solar cells lattice-matched to GaAs. The nitrogen composition was varied between 1% and 5%. The influence of the growth temperature was assessed by performing photoluminescence, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, reflection high-energy electron diffraction, quantum efficiency and light-biased current–voltage measurements. The growth temperature ensuring the best cell parameters was found to be 440°C. At this temperature we were able to incorporate up to 4% of nitrogen and achieve a good material quality. Further increase of the N composition to 5% led to phase separation. For the lattice matched samples grown within the optimal temperature range, we have identified a clear (1×3) surface reconstruction. Using the optimized growth we have demonstrated a GaInNAs p-i-n solar cell structure containing 4% nitrogen, that exhibited a short-circuit current density as high as 33.8mA/cm2 in respect to effective area illuminated. These measurements have been performed under real sun AM1.5 (~1000W/m2) illumination.

Abstract: In this study we present a new approach for p-type PERL solar cells based on an Al2O3 passivation in combination with boron doped amorphous SiCx. During a laser diffusion process, the rear side passivation is locally opened and simultaneously dopants are driven from the stack into the silicon to create a local back surface field resulting in a sheet resistance in the range of 15Ω/sq. We show that the main contribution to the dopants in the local back surface field originates from the a-SiCx:B layer, while aluminum is mainly present near the surface. This p-type PassDop stack is compatible with a firing step, reaching surface recombination velocities lower than 3cm/s. With this stack, small area solar cells on p-type float-zone silicon were processed, achieving energy conversion efficiencies up to 21.4% and fill factors of up to 82.5% with PVD contacts in a proof-of-concept batch.

Abstract: ITO thin films were deposited on glass substrates by d.c. magnetron sputtering with varied oxygen flow rates. It was found that the optical absorption decreases and optical absorption edge has blue shifts with the increasing oxygen flow rate. Oxygen vacancy concentration was characterized and analyzed by XPS. It is shown that the oxygen vacancy concentration increases with oxygen flow rates, which is a different observation from the current understanding. The energy band structures associated with different vacancy concentrations of ITO were calculated using the first-principle based on density functional theory. The calculation results show that the increase of oxygen vacancies induces the increase of bands below Fermi level as well as the presence of a second band gap, which accounts for effects of the oxygen vacancies on the blue shifts.

Abstract: Poly(quarterthiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole), PQT12oBT and PQT12BT, were synthesized through the Stille coupling reaction. The UV–visible absorption spectrum of PQT12oBT showed peaks at 535nm; moreover, it exhibited a higher molar absorption coefficient (ε=44,000M−1cm−1 at 535nm) than PQT12BT (3300M−1cm−1) in chloroform solution. The optical band gap of PQT12oBT was calculated 1.74eV in solid state. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PQT12oBT were −5.18 and −3.44eV, respectively. From the results of X-ray diffraction measurements, the lamellar d-spacing of PQT12oBT in out-of-plane direction was determined to be 21.6Å, and the π–π stacking distance between layers was found to be 4.09Å, with a slight edge-on orientation. Bulk heterojunction-type polymer solar cells were fabricated. With a 1:1 ratio of PQT12oBT and PC71BM, the values of open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were found to be 0.77V, 8.9mAcm−1, 62.4%, and 4.2%, respectively. In addition, PCE was increased up to 4.4% by the addition of 1-bromonaphthalene (1-BrNT) to the active layer.

Abstract: Luminescent solar concentrators (LSC) are a promising technology for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) given the wide variety of forms and colours that can be realised. Given the flexibility of the technology, the use of ray-trace modelling is indispensable in the design, performance evaluation, and optimisation of LSCs. This work begins by comparing a three dimensional (3D) ray-trace model of an LSC with experimental results. The study includes 70 samples – both square and circular LSCs, containing five different fluorescent organic dyes (BASF Lumogen) each at seven different concentrations. The figure-of-merit used for performance evaluation was the average power density determined at the LSC edge sheet, measured using an optical fibre connected to a spectrometer. The results demonstrate that 3D ray-trace results gives good agreement with the experimental measurements, to within around ±5% within a wide concentration range (optical density=0.05–8) and a maximum difference of ±13%. The wide range of colours achieved is presented in a CIE chart. Overall, the validated experimental results give confidence in the use of modelling for future larger LSCs for BIPV. Therefore, based on these results and the colours achievable, a model of a stained-glass window is constructed and its performance throughout a solar day is simulated.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on flexible thin film Ag anodes that are fabricated using a controlled deposition of photoactive layer by inkjet printing. The inkjet printed OPV photo-active layer is a P3HT:PCBM blend incorporated with a high boiling point additive, 1,6-hexanedithiol which serves to allow improved morphology. The devices show comparable power conversion efficiency to those fabricated using spin-coating techniques. Optimization of procedures for OPV fabrication without ITO electrodes or spin-coating of the active layer is a vital step towards realizing the potential of OPVs for mass production.

Abstract: Recycling of polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon and CdTe photovoltaic panels was investigated by studying two alternative routes made up of physical operations: two blade rotors crushing followed by thermal treatment and two blade rotors crushing followed by hammer crushing. Size distribution, X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence analysis of obtained products were carried out in order to evaluate their properties as valuable products. Results showed that for all kinds of investigated photovoltaic modules the two blade rotors crushing followed by hammer crushing and eventually by a thermal treatment of d>1mm fractions, was the best option aiming to a direct recovery of glass.

Abstract: Glial cells are very important for normal brain function and alterations in their activity due to hyperglycemia, could contribute to diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction. Oxidative insults often cause rapid changes in almost all cells including glial cells. However, pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to diabetic complications are not completely elucidated. Therefore, we examined whether elevated glucose levels directly or indirectly disrupt antioxidant defense mechanisms causing alterations in signaling pathways, cell cycle dysregulation, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species-mediated apoptosis in glial cells. Findings of this study demonstrated that exposure of glial cells to high glucose markedly induces cellular and molecular injuries, as evidenced by elevated levels of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, biomolecules damage, cell cycle dysregulation, decrease in antioxidant enzymes, and decrease in cell viability. Pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl-l-cysteine reduced high glucose-induced cytotoxicity by increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes, and decreasing the number of apoptotic cells. Further, at molecular level high glucose treatment resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylation of Akt, MAPKs, tuberin, down regulation of 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase and increase in 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine accumulations. Pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, phosphatidylinositol3-kinase/Akt and ERK1/2 inhibitors completely abolished the apoptotic effects of high glucose. Moreover, N-acetyl-l-cysteine significantly inhibited reactive oxygen/nitrogen species generation, elevated antioxidants levels, inhibited Akt, ERK1/2, tuberin phosphorylation, decreased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine accumulation and upregulated 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase expression. Our results demonstrate that high glucose induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of glial cells, which may be mediated by the phosphorylation of tuberin, down regulation of 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine accumulation via activation of Akt and ERK1/2MAPK pathways.

Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene and is characterized by a perpetuated feedback loop of bacterial infection and inflammation. Both intrinsic (CFTR-dependent) and extrinsic (CFTR-independent) mechanisms contribute to the inflammatory phenotype of CF lung disease. Innate immune cells, initially recruited to combat bacterial pathogens, are acting in a dysregulated and non-resolving fashion in CF airways and cause harm to the host by releasing proteases and oxidants. Targeting harmful immune pathways, while preserving protective ones, remains the challenge for the future. This review highlights current concepts of innate immune dysregulation in CF lung disease. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Cystic Fibrosis: From o-mics to cell biology, physiology, and therapeutic advances.

Abstract: Pre-activation of the retinoid signaling pathway by all-trans retinoic acid facilitates neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Using protein/DNA based screening assays, we identified activator protein 2α as an important downstream target of all-trans retinoic acid. Although all-trans retinoic acid treatment significantly increased activator protein 2α transcriptional activity, it did not affect its expression. Inhibition of activator protein 2α with dominant-negative mutants reduced ATRA-induced differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into neurons and reversed its associated functional recovery of memory impairment in the cell-based treatment of a hypoxic-ischemic brain damage rat model. Dominant-negative mutants of activator protein 2α inhibited the expression of neuronal markers which were induced by retinoic acid receptor β activation. All-trans retinoic acid treatment increased phosphorylation of activator protein 2α and resulted in its nuclear translocation. This was blocked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of retinoic acid receptor β. Furthermore, we found that retinoic acid receptor β directly interacted with activator protein 2α. In summary, the regulation of all-trans retinoic acid on activator protein 2α transcriptional activity was mediated by activation of retinoic acid receptor β and subsequent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of activator protein 2α. Our results strongly suggest that activator protein 2α transcriptional activity is essential for all-trans retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.

Abstract: We investigate the degradation of bulk heterojunction solar cells based on the polymer poly((4,8-bis (octyloxy) benzo (1,2-b:4,5-b׳) dithiophene-2,6-diyl) (2-((dodecyloxy) carbonyl) thieno(3,4-b) thiophenediyl)) (PTB1) and the fullerene [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) under different environments: dry nitrogen atmosphere (H2O<0.1ppm, O2<0.1ppm), air (60±5% relative humidity) and under encapsulation in accordance with established ISOS-D-1 protocols. The evolution of the electrical measurements under dark and illumination conditions is used to analyze the degradation process during 5300h and its relationship with the physical mechanisms. The degradation in the efficiency of the solar cells is mainly due to a reduction of short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) while open circuit voltage (VOC) is the most stable parameter in all studied conditions. The TS80 lifetimes for power conversion efficiency (PCE) of samples exposed to nitrogen and air environments and under encapsulation were 990h, 4h and 48h, respectively. The analysis of the PCE decay permits to identify and evaluate the intensity of different degradation mechanisms (intrinsic polymer chemical reactions or by diffused environmental oxygen or water) in the different conditions.

Abstract: In this study, the epilayer structure of a GaAs solar cell was quickly separated from the GaAs substrate by performing the epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process in hydrofluoric acid (HF) solutions mixed with hydrophilic substances, and the epilayer structure was then transferred to a Cu substrate. The lateral etching rate (7.4–14.3μm/min) of the AlAs sacrificial layer, obtained by adding hydrophilic substances – namely acetone (ACE), isopropanol (IPA), and methanol (MA) – to the HF solution was much higher than that obtained using a pure HF solution (3.6μm/min). We attributed the increase in the lateral etching rate to the decrease in both the surface tension of these solutions and the contact angle between the etching-induced bubble and substrate, which enabled efficient venting of bubbles during the ELO process. By contrast, when the HF:ACE solution was used in the ELO process, few solid products were deposited on the sample surface, indicating that there was little obstruction for bubble venting. Therefore, although HF:ACE exhibited the highest surface tension and contact angle among these three solutions, it still resulted in the highest lateral etching rate (14.3μm/min). When the hydrophilic substances were added to HF solution, the cell efficiency was not degraded after the ELO process. Furthermore, the cell device requiring the shortest removal time of the GaAs substrate exhibited the highest efficiency, because of the low etching-induced damage to the GaAs epilayer. Additionally, the GaAs substrate can be rapidly removed and reused via this ELO technique, which is beneficial for photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: This work reports the synthesis and the characterization of amorphous CoxSiyOz thin films prepared by magnetron sputtering from a single cathode. Porous layers with outstanding electrochromic properties are obtained at room temperature in one step by performing the deposition at a glancing angle configuration. The electrochromic behavior of these layers in a basic aqueous medium was dependent on the Co/Si ratio in the films and in all cases was characterized by a fast response, a high coloration efficiency and a complete reversibility after several hundred cycles. A characteristic feature of these electrochromic layers is that, for a similar thickness, the range of transmittance modulation can be tuned by changing the Co/Si ratio in the films and, specifically for films with a high concentration of silicon, to change their aspect from an almost transparent to a full colored state.

Abstract: The performance of a GaAs p–n junction solar cell was investigated by coating the device with 110nm thick ZnO sol–gel anti-reflection film. A post-furnace thermal annealing at 150°C for 30min was performed on the ZnO film after it was spin coated on the device with a speed of 8000rpm. Ellipsometry was used to measure the reflectance, thickness, and the refractive index of the ZnO film. The solar cell performance was investigated by using the current–voltage technique from which the power conversion efficiency was extracted. The spectral response and quantum efficiency were also measured for the solar cell. An enhancement, after utilizing the ZnO anti-reflection coating, was observed on the order of 32%, 38, and 51% for the power conversion efficiency, spectral response, and quantum efficiency, respectively.

Abstract: Azurin is a bacterial protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa which exerts an inhibitory activity in cancer cells. In P-cadherin-overexpressing models, a bad prognosis marker in breast cancer increasing invasion and other malignant features, azurin decreases the invasion of cancer cells. We performed a microarray analysis to compare the expression profile of azurin treated cells with different P-cadherin expression levels. Azurin up-regulated apoptosis mediated by p53 protein, endocytosis and vesicle-mediated transport. In the contrary, in invasive MCF-7/AZ.Pcad cells, azurin decreased the expression of genes associated with cell surface receptors and signal transduction, as well as biological adhesion. Further, azurin decreased adhesion of cells to proteins from the extracellular matrix (ECM) and altered protein expression of integrins α6, β4 and β1 and interfered with the ability of these cells to form mammospheres. Altogether, our results further enlighten the anti-cancer effects mediated by azurin in P-cadherin overexpression breast cancer models.

Abstract: Organ transplantation is the most effective medical therapy for end-stage renal disease patients; however, there is a critical shortage of human donor organs. Therefore, xenotransplantation using genetically modified cloned porcine kidney is considered as a viable solution, but its fundamental therapeutic mechanism and difference from non-cloned porcine or human kidney for its clinical application is not well known. Here, we performed proteomic analysis to investigate the differentially expressed molecules in kidney tissue obtained from cloned porcine by SCNT, when compared with normal porcine kidney in same age as a control. A total of 80 protein spots were differentially expressed between cloned porcine kidney and control kidney, including apoptotic proteins, structural and anti-oxidant related proteins. Furthermore, very interestingly, the differential expression pattern of PrxII in the cloned porcine kidney was distinguishable from that in the control kidney in terms of the pI and molecular weight. Along with this, apoptotic marker proteins were up-regulated in the cloned porcine kidney. We suggested that these alterations were induced by post-translational modification such as phosphorylation in PrxII and could be mediated by JNK. With this result, we also observed that the down-regulation of JNK activity was caused by blockage of phosphorylation in PrxII T89A region. Taken together, cloned porcine kidney is more susceptible in JNK-induced apoptosis caused by PrxII phosphorylation, in oxidative stress condition. These results will be helpful in the application of cloned porcine xeno-transplants for treating end-stage renal disease patients in a clinical setting.

Abstract: Large-area, well-separated, and vertically aligned silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays with excellent antireflection properties were fabricated through a combination of anodic aluminum oxide template and metal-assisted chemical etching, followed by supercritical drying. Less than 1% reflectance was achieved over the wavelength range of 200–600nm, and 23% reduction in average reflectance was observed over the 200–1000nm range, compared with the conical-frustum structure array by natural drying. Furthermore, the well-separated SiNW arrays considerably facilitated the conformal coating of the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited amorphous silicon layer on the SiNW surface, which could result in effective passivation of surface states. Therefore, such well-separated and vertically aligned SiNW arrays are highly promising for solar cell application.

Abstract: Aim of the study
To evaluate the psychological morbidity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on children and their parents at different stages of illness and to assess the crucial contribution of the psychologist in the pediatric oncology team.
Methods
We recruited 103 children with ALL and their 96 parents, and divided them into five groups according to disease phase: diagnosis, initial remission, active treatment, survival and relapsing. We compared these to 22 healthy controls and their parents. Patients and controls were subjected to clinical assessments, the symptoms checklist of the International Classification of Disease ICD (ICD-10), and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children The parents of patients and controls underwent a general health questionnaire, the ICD-10 symptoms checklist, rating scales for anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) assessment scale, and the physical cognitive affective social economic ego problems (PCASEE) questionnaire for quality of life (QOL) rating.
Results
Psychiatric morbidity was evident in nearly 60% of leukemic children and their parents and was significantly increased in comparison to controls. Children mostly suffered from adjustment and oppositional defiant disorders. The most common discriminators between patient groups were conduct and attention problems being lowest in newly diagnosed patients, and social aggression being lowest in patients in remission. The three parameters were highest in relapsed patients whose parents mostly had adjustment and depressive disorders. Risk factors for child psychopathology were older age, female gender, and parental psychopathology. Mothers and parents with lower education and professional level were found to be vulnerable. Performance and total intelligence quotient (IQ) were significantly lower in leukemic children, and these were most pronounced in the survivor group. Risk factors for cognitive dysfunction were younger age, longer chemotherapy duration, and lower parental education level.
Conclusion
Most patients and their caregivers suffered from significant psychiatric morbidity, highlighting the need for routine screening to improve psychological outcomes in such cases.

Abstract: Podoplanin (PDPN) is a mucin-like transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in development and cancer. Here, we provide evidence that the intracellular domain (ICD) of podoplanin is released into the cytosol following a sequential proteolytic processing by a metalloprotease and γ-secretase. Western blotting and cell fractionation studies revealed that HEK293T and MDCK cells transfected with an eGFP-tagged podoplanin construct (PDPNeGFP, 50–63kDa) constitutively express two C-terminal fragments (CTFs): a ∼33kDa membrane-bound PCTF33, and a ∼29kDa cytosolic podoplanin ICD (PICD). While pharmacological inhibition of metalloproteases reduced the expression of PCTF33, treatment of cells with γ-secretase inhibitors resulted in enhanced PCTF33 levels. PCTF33 processing by γ-secretase depends on presenilin-1 (PS1) function: cells expressing a dominant negative form of PS1 (PS1 D385N), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient in PS1, but not in PS2, show higher levels of PCTF33 expression with respect to wild-type MEFs. Furthermore, transfection of PS1 deficient MEFs with wild-type PS1 (PS1 wt) decreased PCTF33 levels. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the affinity purified PICD revealed that the γ-secretase cleavage site was located between valines 150 and 151, but these residues are not critical for proteolysis. We found that podoplanin CTFs are also generated in cells expressing podoplanin mutants harboring heterologous transmembrane regions. Taken together, these results indicate that podoplanin is a novel substrate for PS1/γ-secretase.

Abstract: This study synthesized a highly soluble quinacridone-acceptor series (PQCDTB, PQCDTQ-a, PQCDTQ-b) through the Suzuki coupling reaction by introducing planar quinacridone and a highly soluble acceptor unit. The polymers largely dissolved organic solvents, and the Mn ranged from 40.5 to 63.1kg/mol. The intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effects were much stronger in PQCDTQ-b than in PQCDTB and PQCDTQ due to the position of the oxygen atom. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers were −5.18 to −5.37eV and −3.28 to −3.40eV, respectively. According to XRD measurements, PQCDTB exhibited the formation of an ordered lamellar structure and conventional edge-on π-stacking, whereas PQCDTQ-a and PQCDTQ-b exhibited face-on formation relative to the substrate. The open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were 0.85V, 7.6mA/cm2, 61.5%, and 4.0%, respectively, for PQCDTQ-a with a 1:2 ratio of PC71BM.

Abstract: Copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) is highly abundant in nature. It is an important absorber material for the development of low-cost and sustainable next-generation I2–II–IV–VI4 thin-film solar cells because it has a the tunable direct band gap energy, inexpensive constituent elements, and a large absorption coefficient in the visible wavelength region. This work develops an efficient one-step vacuum-based approach to depositing CZTS films without the need to supply excess sulfur during/after deposition or to perform any post-sulfurization treatment. This one-step RF sputtering process produces CZTS films that are crystalline, phase-pure, dense, smooth, and continuous. Air Mass 1.5 G power conversion efficiencies of as high as 6% have been achieved with an antireflection coating, demonstrating that this new approach has great potential as a low-cost alternative for high-efficiency CZTS solar cell production.

Abstract: With the growing interest in flexible electronics and the increased utilization of Indium Tin Oxide electrodes for display and photovoltaic applications the need for new materials is emerging. In this work we present the electro-optical properties of Ag nanowire networks as an alternative transparent conductive material. A comparison of different film deposition techniques is made and indicates that the properties of the network are independent of the fabrication method. Analysis of the electrical behavior as a function of nanowire density is made and compared with theoretical results as well as Monte Carlo simulations. Thermal annealing is shown to reduce the sheet resistance from 1000Ω/sq to 8Ω/sq; this reduction is achieved by local sintering of the nanowire junctions. Experimental optimization of Ag nanowire electrodes was undertaken and a peak in the electro-optical properties is observed at approximately 100mg/m². Finally a discussion of the potential integration of Ag nanowire networks into solar cells is undertaken; we observe that these electrodes show promise as an emerging transparent conductive material, especially for flexible applications.

Abstract: A photovoltaic module and its components are exposed to the natural variability of stress factors in outdoor environments. This variable environment makes it difficult to choose an adequate backsheet for each field operating conditions. To account for these factors, we investigate the mechanism of degradation for several types of backsheets which were aged under different levels of damp heat as well as pressure cooker test. The study quantitatively demonstrates how environmental stresses impact the degradation in performance of different types of backsheets. The degradation of backsheet was quantitatively investigated by mechanical tensile. To describe the degradation mechanism, the molecular weight of core materials was measured by using gel permeation chromatography. An accelerated test conditions resulted in significant hydrolysis of core materials and degrease in molecular weight of them. Tests show the degradation pattern of different types of backsheets for each accelerated test conditions. In addition, the degradation pattern aged under damp heat and pressure cooker test can be correlated and the latter can provide rapid material evaluation.

Abstract: The reactivity of HF(40wt%)–HNO3(100wt%)–H2SO4(97wt%) etching mixtures towards conventional SiC-slurry and diamond-wire sawn silicon wafers has been studied. Sulfuric acid-rich mixtures exhibit adequate etching rates (r<5µmmin−1) and generate homogenously distributed, small etching pits on both types of silicon wafers. Textured wafer surfaces were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), laser scanning microscopy (LSM), surface roughness analyses and reflectivity studies. The surface roughness is influenced by the etch depth and the type of saw damage. Etching in sulfuric acid-rich mixtures significantly reduces the reflection of SiC-slurry sawn wafers and, in particular, of diamond-wire sawn wafers. The reflection of etched silicon surfaces is discussed in terms of etch depth and surface roughness. Compared to the conventional HF–HNO3–H2O etching process, multicrystalline silicon (SiC-slurry and diamond-wire sawn) based solar cells texturized by sulfuric acid-rich mixtures exhibit increased efficiencies.

Abstract: The present study investigated the effects of hyperprolinemia on oxidative damage to biomolecules (protein, lipids and DNA) and the antioxidant status in blood of rats. The influence of the antioxidants on the effects elicited by proline was also examined. Wistar rats received two daily injections of proline and/or vitamin E plus C (6th–28th day of life) and were killed 12h after the last injection. Results showed that hyperprolinemia induced a significant oxidative damage to proteins, lipids and DNA demonstrated by increased carbonyl content, malondialdehyde levels and a greater damage index in comet assay, respectively. The concomitant antioxidants administration to proline treatment completely prevented oxidative damage to proteins, but partially prevented lipids and DNA damage. We also observed that the non-enzymatic antioxidant potential was decreased by proline treatment and partially prevented by antioxidant supplementation. The plasma levels of vitamins E and C significantly increased in rats treated exogenously with these vitamins but, interestingly, when proline was administered concomitantly with vitamin E plus C, the levels of these vitamins were similar to those found in plasma of control and proline rats. Our findings suggest that hyperprolinemia promotes oxidative damage to the three major classes of macromolecules in blood of rats. These effects were accomplished by decrease in non-enzymatic antioxidant potential and decrease in vitamins administered exogenously, which significantly decreased oxidative damage to biomolecules studied. These data suggest that antioxidants may be an effective adjuvant therapeutic to limit oxidative damage caused by proline.

Abstract: A new composite counter electrode consisting of Cu2S nanoparticles (NPs) and active carbon/carbon black has been developed for CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells (CdS/CdSe QDSCs). This kind of composite photocathode is suitable for screen printing, and exhibits good catalytic activity toward S22−/S2− redox couple. Based on this Cu2S/carbon composite electrode, sealed CdS/CdSe QDSCs were fabricated, which can present up to 3.87% of light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Besides, our newly developed Cu2S/carbon composite electrode was primarily stable in 1M polysulfide electrolyte after the QDSCs with this counter electrode were sealed, kept in the dark at room temperature and tested every two or three days for 30 days. On the basis of the above results, CdS/CdSe QDSC modules consisting of four paralleled sub-cells with the aperture area of over 12cm2 have been designed and prepared for the first time. Up to 2.31% of light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of CdS/CdSe QDSC module was achieved. This Cu2S/carbon composite electrode exhibits good potential application for further investigation.

Abstract: Near-infrared (NIR)-sensitive hybrid bulk heterojunction solar cells were developed using NIR-absorbing HgTe quantum dots (QDs) and a low-bandgap polymer, poly[2,6-(4,4′-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PSBTBT). Hybrid composites of HgTe QDs and PSBTBT facilitate broad-range exploitation of the solar spectrum and efficient carrier dissociation prior to recombination. Nanostructures were formed on the surface of the hybrid composite via a nanoimprinting process using an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) mold. This contributes to optical light scattering for efficient utilization of light up to the NIR region and enlarged photoactive layer–electrode interfacial areas for improving charge extraction, increasing the overall efficiency from 1.09 to 1.41%.

Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) gut manifestations are predominantly secondary to cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (CFTR) dysfunction. The CFTR gene is expressed throughout the intestinal tract. Because the intestine is difficult to assess in humans, there exists a lack of data on the underlying mechanisms of intestinal dysfunction. A more tractable approach involves the use of mouse models of CF, created by gene targeting techniques, to describe the consequences of CFTR dysfunction in the intestinal tissues, including mucus accumulation, disturbed motility, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and inflammation with altered innate immune responses, that are likely to be interrelated. We will focus on the latter. Recently, in people with CF, even in the absence of overt gastrointestinal symptoms, chronic intestinal inflammation and abnormal balance of the microbiota have been evidenced. Because chronic gut inflammation may be a driver for systemic inflammation, the prevention and control of intestinal inflammation represents a promising research strategy.

Abstract: Although there is a growing literature describing the role of macrophages in breast cancer, the role of macrophages in inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is unclear. The aim of present study was to isolate and characterize tumor associated macrophages of IBC and non-IBC patients and define their role in IBC. Tumor infiltrating monocytes/macrophages (CD14+ and CD68+) were measured by immunohistochemistry using specific monoclonal antibodies. Blood drained from axillary vein tributaries was collected during breast cancer surgery and the percentage of CD14+ in the total isolated leukocytes was assessed by flow cytometric analysis. CD14+ cells were separated from total leukocytes by immuno-magnetic beads technique and were cultured overnight. Media conditioned by CD14+ were collected and subjected to cytokine profiling using cytokine antibody array. Wound healing and invasion assays were used to test whether cytokines highly secreted by tumor drained macrophages induce motility and invasion of breast cancer cells. We found that macrophages highly infiltrate into carcinoma tissues of IBC patients. In addition blood collected from axillary tributaries of IBC patients is highly enriched with CD14+ cells as compared to blood collected from non-IBC patients. Cytokine profiling of CD14+ cells isolated from IBC patients revealed a significant increase in secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α; monocyte chemoattractant protein-1/CC-chemokine ligand 2; interleukin-8 and interleukin-10 as compared to CD14+ cells isolated from non-IBC patients. Tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-8 and interleukin-10 significantly increased motility and invasion of IBC cells in vitro. In conclusion, macrophages isolated from the tumor microenvironment of IBC patients secrete chemotactic cytokines that may augment dissemination and metastasis of IBC carcinoma cells.

Abstract: The recovery of an intact epithelium following injury is critical for restoration of lung homeostasis, a process that may be altered in cystic fibrosis (CF). In response to injury, progenitor cells in the undamaged areas migrate, proliferate and re-differentiate to regenerate an intact airway epithelium. The mechanisms regulating this regenerative response are, however, not well understood. In a model of circular wound injury of well-differentiated human airway epithelial cell (HAEC) cultures, we identified the gap junction protein Cx26 as an important regulator of cell proliferation. We report that induction of Cx26 in repairing HAECs is associated with cell proliferation. We also show that Cx26 is expressed in a population of CK14-positive basal-like cells. Cx26 silencing in immortalized cell lines using siRNA and in primary HAECs using lentiviral-transduced shRNA enhanced Ki67-labeling index and Ki67 mRNA, indicating that Cx26 acts a negative regulator of HAEC proliferation. Cx26 silencing also markedly decreased the transcription of KLF4 in immortalized HAECs. We further show that CF HAECs exhibited deregulated expression of KLF4, Ki67 and Cx26 as well enhanced rate of wound closure in the early response to injury. These results point to an altered repair process of CF HAECs characterized by rapid but desynchronized initiation of HAEC activation and proliferation.

Abstract: Highly reflective roofs can decrease the energy required for building air conditioning, help mitigate the urban heat island effect, and slow global warming. However, these benefits are diminished by soiling and weathering processes that reduce the solar reflectance of most roofing materials. Soiling results from the deposition of atmospheric particulate matter and the growth of microorganisms, each of which absorb sunlight. Weathering of materials occurs with exposure to water, sunlight, and high temperatures. This study developed an accelerated aging method that incorporates features of soiling and weathering. The method sprays a calibrated aqueous soiling mixture of dust minerals, black carbon, humic acid, and salts onto preconditioned coupons of roofing materials, then subjects the soiled coupons to cycles of ultraviolet radiation, heat and water in a commercial weatherometer. Three soiling mixtures were optimized to reproduce the site-specific solar spectral reflectance features of roofing products exposed for 3 years in a hot and humid climate (Miami, Florida); a hot and dry climate (Phoenix, Arizona); and a polluted atmosphere in a temperate climate (Cleveland, Ohio). A fourth mixture was designed to reproduce the three-site average values of solar reflectance and thermal emittance attained after 3 years of natural exposure, which the Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) uses to rate roofing products sold in the US. This accelerated aging method was applied to 25 products–single ply membranes, factory and field applied coatings, tiles, modified bitumen cap sheets, and asphalt shingles–and reproduced in 3 days the CRRC's 3-year aged values of solar reflectance. This accelerated aging method can be used to speed the evaluation and rating of new cool roofing materials.

Abstract: Thin films of W–Ti oxide were prepared by reactive DC magnetron sputtering and were characterized by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The electrochromic properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry in an electrolyte of lithium perchlorate in propylene carbonate and by optical transmittance measurements. The addition of Ti significantly promoted the amorphous nature of the films and stabilized their electrochemical cycling performance and dynamic range for electrochromism.

Abstract: As a typical thermochromic material, vanadium dioxide (VO2) has the potential to serve as a smart regulator of building energy consumption. However, a selection of currently used VO2 glazing types were found to lack such smart regulation capacity due to their increased solar absorptivity after entering the metallic state, and the cooling energy consumption of a room containing such VO2 glazing increased as the transition temperature decreased. This study presents a comprehensive discussion of this glazing's smart regulation capacity. It is observed that the VO2 glazing's smart regulation capacity is influenced by property variations in its solar absorptivity and transmittance after the transition process. Smart Index (SI) is proposed to evaluate the “smart level” of VO2 glazing, and a contour map of SI is plotted to provide a concise method of determining how “smart” VO2 glazing can be.

Osteoblast differentiation and migration are regulated by dynamin GTPase activity,

Abstract: Bone formation is controlled by osteoblasts, but the signaling proteins that control osteoblast differentiation and function are still unclear. We examined if the dynamin GTPase, which is associated with actin remodeling and migration in other cells, plays a role in osteoblast differentiation and migration. Dynamin mRNA was expressed in primary osteoblasts throughout differentiation (0–21 days). However, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, a marker of osteoblast differentiation, was decreased in osteoblasts over-expressing dynamin. Conversely, ALP activity was increased following shRNA-mediated knockdown of dynamin and in osteoblasts treated with the dynamin inhibitor, dynasore. Dynasore also reduced c-fos and osterix expression, markers of early osteoblasts, suggesting a role for dynamin in pre-osteoblast to osteoblast differentiation. Since dynamin GTPase activity is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, we examined the mechanism of dynamin dephosphorylation in osteoblasts. Dynamin formed a protein complex with the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST and inhibition of phosphatase activity increased the level of phosphorylated dynamin. Further, PTP-PEST blocked the Src-mediated increase in the phosphorylation and GTPase activity of wild-type dynamin but not the phosphorylation mutant dynY231F/Y597F. Although ALP activity was increased in osteoblasts expressing GTPase-defective dynK44A, and to a lesser extent dynY231F/Y597F, osteoblast migration was significantly inhibited by dynK44A and dynY231F/Y597F. These studies demonstrate a novel role for dynamin GTPase activity and phosphorylation in osteoblast differentiation and migration, which may be important for bone formation.

Abstract: Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a rare disease with characteristic clinical and histological features, previously reported to be associated with various hematological and solid malignancies. We report a typical case of eosinophilic fasciitis in a 67-year-old man in association with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and subsequently bladder cancer. On the two occasions, the eosinophilic fasciitis completely resolved upon successful treatment of the concomitant malignancy. The diagnosis of EF should trigger further evaluation for any associated hematological disorder, which, if adequately treated, can result in the resolution of EF.

Abstract: We investigated the characteristics of TiO2 and ZnO co-sputtered ZnTiO (ZTO) buffer layer for use in inverted organic solar cell (IOSCs). The 40nm-thick ZTO buffer layer deposited on a crystalline ITO cathode showed different device performances depending on the RF and DC powers applied on the TiO2 and ZnO targets, respectively. Compared to IOSCs with a TiO2-rich ZTO buffer layer, the IOSCs with a ZnO-rich ZTO buffer layer showed better performances due to their higher optical transmittances and well-matched work function. At the optimized power ratio of ZnO:TiO2 (70:30%), the ZTO buffer layer exhibited an optical transmittance of 78% at a wavelength of 550nm. The IOSCs with the optimized ZTO buffer layer exhibited a good cell-performance with a fill factor of 52.05%, a short circuit current of 8.81mA/cm2, an open circuit voltage of 0.66V, and a power conversion efficiency of 3.03%, which are comparable to IOSCs containing a conventional sol–gel processed ZnO buffer layer. Furthermore, the microstructure and interface structure for the IOSC with the ZTO buffer layer and ITO cathode-integrated electrode was investigated in detail using high resolution transmission electron microscopy.

Abstract: Ionic liquid based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were exposed to outdoor irradiation for seven months (April-October, 906kWh/m2, latitude 46°2'39.39"N, longitude 14°29'18.28"E) under short-circuit, open-circuit, and quasi maximum-power-point regime. As a reference we kept a series of DSSCs in the dark at room temperature under open-circuit regime. The performance of the DSSCs was evaluated indoor under standard test conditions prior to ageing, twice during ageing and after ageing. Additionally, the electroluminescence and transmittance imaging were used to follow the evolution of local defects with ageing. Operating regime has a strong influence on the ageing of DSSCs but despite this the performance of DSSCs remained remarkably stable. The exceptions were cells aged under short-circuit regime, which led to a significant decrease in JSC. This resulted from the degradation of the dye molecules and a decrease in the tri-iodide concentration in the electrolyte.

Abstract: Metal ion induced self-assembly of iron(II)-acetate with the rigid ditopic ligand 1,4-bis(2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridin-4′-yl)benzene results in a metallo-supramolecular coordination polyelectrolyte (Fe-MEPE). Fe-MEPE shows a strong absorption band in the visible region around 590nm, attributed to a metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer (MLCT) transition, which is responsible for the deep blue colour. Large area thin films of high optical quality can be readily fabricated by a dip coating process on transparent conducting electrodes. The Fe-MEPE films have a temperature stability up to 80°C, measured by optical spectroscopy and XAFS (x-ray absorption fine structure). The cathodically coloured Fe-MEPE shows outstanding electrochromic properties and can be reversibly switched from Fe(II) (blue) to Fe(III) (colourless) by applying a potential of 4.1V vs. Li/Li+. A very high optical contrast ΔT of 71% at a wavelength of 590nm and a colouration efficiency of around 525cm2C−1 can be realized. The devices show a long-term stability about 10,000 cycles. Thus, Fe-MEPE is a very promising electrochromic material for future applications of smart windows.

Abstract: A lot of efforts have been devoted to synthesize novel fullerene derivatives to improve the performance of polymer-based bulk heterojunction photocells. Although the archetypical soluble fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is frequently treated as a reference material, PCBM, which carries both aromatic and aliphatic moieties, is not very simple molecule. In this context, unmodified C60, which is the simplest molecule among the C60-based fullerenes, seems to be the most suitable for the reference material. Here, a set of systematic experiments on the device performances of the bulk heterojunction composites consisting of P3HT and unmodified C60 over various compositions and annealing temperatures has been carried out. It has been found that the apparent optimum composition strongly depends on the annealing temperature chosen. Additionally, a monotonic relationship between the shift in the open-circuit voltage and the multiplication factor of the short-circuit photocurrent has been also found, directly indicating that the fullerene aggregation results in increased electron affinity to enhance the charge separation in the composites.

Abstract: Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is a semicrystalline polymer with a strong tendency to form gelation in solvents. Recent investigations focused on the mechanism and the dynamics of P3HT gelation forming in solution. In this work, we systematically studied the effect of the dispersion degree of sol–gel P3HT:PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester), which was characterized by the capillary rise height, on photovoltaic performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells. Without solvent and thermal annealing, the power conversion efficiency of devices fabricated from sol–gel blend solution with certain dispersion can reach 2.35%, 5.6 times higher than that of the devices from the same solution with complete dispersion. The ordered self-assembled P3HT due to the strong intermolecular π-electronic coupling found by UV–vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction characterizations and the good contact between these P3HT crystalline and PCBM in the films explained the good performance of the BHJ organic solar cells made from these disperse sol–gel solutions without any annealing.

Abstract: We present on line formation of a sol from wet-deposited aqueous potassium silicate solutions as a novel route for the generation of highly performing large-area anti-reflective (AR) surfaces on glasses for solar energy conversion. Compared to alternative technologies, the present approach enables processing at very low cost. The mechanism of coating formation and consolidation was evaluated. Following deposition, the aqueous potassium silicate solution dries into a gel of interconnected SiO2 colloids and dispersed potassium hydroxides and carbonates. A typical size of ~20–40nm of the colloids is established already at this stage without significant growth in the later process. Potassium species are removed in a subsequent washing procedure, leaving only a minor amount of residual potassium at the interface between coating and substrate in an otherwise nanoporous silica layer. Physically and chemically bound water species are driven-out of the coating in a final annealing step. In this way, an AR layer of nanoporous silica with a thickness of ~100–150nm is easily created. The AR effect is caused by two-beam interference at this layer, enabling an absolute transmission increase of 3.6% at a wavelength of 550nm and a relative transmission increase of 3.1% over the spectral range of 400–1100nm for a single-side coating on solar glass for c-Si as well as thin-film modules.

Abstract: A solar-selective functional multi-layered coating for high temperature applications has been developed on copper and stainless steel substrates using an industrially viable cathodic arc physical vapor deposition technique. The selective coating was formulated in such a way that the constituent functional layers are mainly high temperature stable nitride materials which are also hard and capable of imparting protection against wear. A multi-layer structure comprising TiAlCrN as IR reflector, TiAlN as absorber and AlSiN as anti-reflective layer was found to exhibit promising results. The stacking of these three materials with appropriate thickness in a systematic manner, viz. Cu/TiAlCrN/TiAlN/AlSiN with high Cr and Al contents in TiAlCrN and TiAlN layers, respectively, yielded high absorptivity (αAM1.5=0.91) and low emissivity (ε=0.07) values corresponding to an attractive optical selectivity (α/ε) of 13. The open air high temperature performance of the optimized multi-layer structure was also investigated in the temperature range 27–700°C and the stability of the coatings at high temperatures with respect to optical properties was established.

Abstract: Carbon nanotube/PEG/SiO2 composites were prepared from multiwall carbon nanotubes, poly(ethylene glycol), and inorganic SiO2, and found to be an efficient full-band sunlight conversion and storage device. Compared with traditional phase-change materials, the composite exhibited rapid and broadband visible light-harvesting characteristics, light-thermal conversion, thermal energy storage ability, form-stable effects, and high thermal conductivity. The results showed that the combination of a light–heat conversion agent and a phase change thermal storage material can effectively improve the efficiency of solar energy applications.

Abstract: To identify novel tumor-associated proteins, we analyzed the protein expression patterns from experimental hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that were induced using hepatocarcinogenesis models in rats. Rats were subjected to two previously described protocols of hepatocarcinogenesis using diethylnitrosamine as a carcinogen: the alternative Solt–Farber (aS&F) protocol, which induces HCC within 9 months, and Schiffer's model, which induces cirrhosis and multifocal HCC within 18 weeks. The patterns of protein expression from tumors and normal liver tissue were examined by SDS-PAGE and the bands identified at 33–34kDa were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1) showed the highest number of peptides, with a confidence of level >99%. The increased expression of PTGR1 in tumors was confirmed in these two models by Western blotting and by increase in alkenal/one oxidoreductase activity (25-fold higher than normal liver). In addition, the gene expression level of Ptgr1, as measured by qRT-PCR, was increased during cancer development in a time-dependent manner (200-fold higher than normal liver). Furthermore, PTGR1 was detected in the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells in rat tumors and in 12 human HCC cases by immunohistochemistry. These analyses were performed by comparing the expression of PTGR1 to that of two well-known markers of hepatocarcinoma, Glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) in rats and glypican-3 in humans. The increased expression and activity of PTGR1 in liver carcinogenesis encourage further research aimed at understanding the metabolic role of PTGR1 in HCC and its potential application for human cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: The effects of spongy graphene on the latent heat and thermal conductivity of the phase change material consisting of docosane and spongy graphene were studied. The latent heat and thermal conductivity of docosane/graphene composites were simultaneously enhanced in contrast to that of pure docosane. The latent heat increased from 256.1J/g to 262.8J/g, and the thermal conductivity increased more than 2 times in a low graphene concentration of ~3mg/cm3. X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer were used to characterize the microstructure of docosane and docosane/graphene composite. It is found that the crystallinity of layered docosane was enhanced in the presence of spongy graphene sheets acting as a nucleating agent, which resulted in the increase of latent heat. The enhancement of thermal conductivity for docosane/graphene composite is attributed to the high thermal conductivity of graphene.

Abstract: We present a method to characterize bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules for simultaneous front and rear side illumination (i.e., bifacial illumination). The method uses standard monofacial (i.e., single-sided) indoor current–voltage measurements on the front and rear sides of the bifacial module, while covering the other side with a non-reflecting black cover. To define the performance under bifacial illumination, new bifacial parameters (short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor and efficiency) are calculated using a one-diode model of the PV module. Assuming linear current response of PV modules for different illuminations, the method numerically simulates the performance of bifacial PV modules for various combinations of front and rear side irradiances. The method is useful in predicting the behavior of the bifacial PV module under bifacial illumination, without actually measuring the module under these conditions. Using a silicon wafer based bifacial PV module, we demonstrate experimentally that the method can predict the performance to within 1% variation with actual measurements.

Abstract: Over a dozen novel cationic phosphonium dispersants were used in preparation of conductive silver pastes for photovoltaic applications. We investigated the relationship between the structures of phosphonium compounds and the efficiency of p-type silicon PV cells and the phosphorus interaction with the wafer, frit, and silver particles in the paste. Three dispersants were found to be the most beneficial with increases in the cell efficiencies of 0.1–0.3% on poly-crystalline and mono-crystalline Si cells. All of them have long chain substituents at phosphonium function and weakly coordinating anions. Better dispersion of metal oxide particles, which are making the frit, was seen when these phosphonium dispersants are present. Laser ablation – ICP-MS was used to measure the phosphorus profile, and was able to detect phosphorus within silver particles and the silicon substrate indicating the possibility of self-doping. Additionally, the transmission line method (TLM) was applied to quantify the contact resistivity.

Abstract: Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on alkyl-substituted thienylenevinylene and phthalimide-based D-A copolymer (PTVPhI-Eh) as a donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor were investigated with the intent of gaining high performance photovoltaic properties. PTVPhI-Eh had a deep highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, ~0.3eV lower than rr-P3HT. As a result, PTVPhI-Eh:PC71BM devices showed a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87V, which is over 0.2V higher compared to that of P3HT:PCBM-based PSCs. The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs was 4.14% with Voc of 0.87V, short circuit current (Jsc) of 7.32mA/cm2, and fill factor (FF) of 65%, under optimized conditions of a 1:1wt/wt ratio and treatment with a 2vol% 1-chloronaphthalene solvent additive. The Voc and consequent photovoltaic performance of this PSC was significantly affected by the concentration of the solvent additive. To determine the relationship between Voc and concentration of solvent additive, PTVPhI-Eh:PC71BM devices were investigated with various analyses such as optical spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

Abstract: Organic solar cells imprinted with nanostructures, by the capillary force lithography process using soft molding, on either the active layer or the electron transport layer (ZnO) of an inverted organic solar cell are made. With proper control of the wetness of the ZnO or the active layer, either of them can be readily driven by the capillary force into the cavities formed by the nanostructures on the soft mold during the imprint. The nanostructures demonstrated here can be either regular gratings or arrays of nanorods. Due to light scattering and intrusion of the nanostructures into the active layer, both light absorption and carrier transport can be significantly improved, which can effectively increase both the fill factor and the power conversion efficiency (PCE). For solar cells having nanostructures imprinted on the electron transport layer of ZnO, the PCE can increase from 2.39 to 2.65% for gratings or 3% for arrays of nanorods, respectively, and the fill factor can increase from 0.5 to 0.57 for arrays of nanorods. For solar cells having nanostructures of gratings imprinted on the active layer, the fill factor increases from 0.5 to 0.6, the current density increases from 9.02mA/cm2 to 9.73mA/cm2, and the PCE increases from 2.4 to 3.05%. The use of capillary force to imprint nanostructures eliminates the use of costly imprint equipments and possible damage of the active layer by contacting with air.

Abstract: This paper describes a complete modelling of the perimeter recombination of GaAs diodes which solves most unknowns and suppresses the limitations of previous models. Because of the three dimensional nature of the implemented model, it is able to simulate real devices. GaAs diodes on two epiwafers with different base doping levels, sizes and geometries, namely square and circular are manufactured. The validation of the model is achieved by fitting the experimental measurements of the dark IV curve of the manufactured GaAs diodes. A comprehensive 3-D description of the occurring phenomena affecting the perimeter recombination is supplied with the help of the model. Finally, the model is applied to concentrator GaAs solar cells to assess the impact of their doping level, size and geometry on the perimeter recombination.

Abstract: Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) encapsulated eicosanoic–stearic acid (EA–SA) eutectic nanocapsules were prepared by ultraviolet photoinitiated emulsion polymerization and various characterization techniques were employed to investigate the influence of preparation methods on thermal properties and particle size distribution (PSD). The results show that the particle size decreased and PSD narrowed with the increase of agitation speed, reduction of initiator and monomer concentration, existence of cross-linking agent and stabilized at agitated speed higher than 5000rpm and monomer concentration lower than 0.15mol/L. However, latent heats of the capsules decreased with the increase of monomer and initiator concentration. Type of emulsifier in emulsion has significant effects on PSD and phase change properties of EA–SA/PMMA and nonionic emulsifier is suitable for reducing particle size and enhancing heat storage ability. Morphology and chemical characteristic analysis indicate that spherical nanocapsules with average diameter of 46nm were successfully fabricated and its maximum encapsulation ratio is 68.8wt% without leakage of core material. The melting and crystallizing temperatures and latent heats of capsules were determined as 56.9°C and 54.5°C, 126.4J/g and 128.3J/g, respectively. Accelerated thermal cycling test shows that the nanocapsules have good thermal and chemical reliability after repeated thermal cycling. Besides, the super-cooling problem of PCMs reduced dramatically by forming nanocapsules.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a statistical approach based on Taguchi method and Grey relational analysis for effective optimization of indium tin oxide (ITO) films which are used as front contact for shallow emitter based crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. The experiments were designed by the Taguchi method through an orthogonal array, resulting in the reduction of the number of experiments by approximately 90%; the reproduction effect of process parameters on performance characteristics, however, is still ensured. Excellent compromise between electrical and optical properties of ITO films was obtained by Grey relational analysis at power density of 0.685W/cm2, working pressure of 0.4Pa, substrate temperature of 250°C, and post-annealing temperature of 300°C in 30min. The ITO films exhibited lowest electrical resistivity of 1.316×10−4Ωcm, and highest transmittance of 91.251% under optimal condition. The shallow emitter based c-Si solar cells using the optimal ITO films showed highest efficiency of 17.555%, yielding a 1.375% absolute increase in efficiency compared to using ITO films with initial condition. Furthermore, using analysis of variance, we found that the substrate temperature was a key parameter which critically affected the opto-electrical properties of ITO films.

Abstract: This paper reports on the long-term testing of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) compared with a polycrystalline Si solar cell under the outdoor conditions of Abu Dhabi, UAE. A comparison of the temperature and irradiance dependence of both types of solar cells shows that DSSCs has relatively better performance than the polycrystalline Si solar cell under low irradiance levels and high temperatures. The monthly energy yields reveal that DSSCs produce about 20% higher energy during the spring months and about 30% higher energy during the summer months. The long-term stability of different DSSCs has been monitored under real outdoor conditions for over six months and degradation mechanisms have been proposed. Ionic liquid based DSSCs were significantly more stable when compared to devices based on other electrolyte solvents. However, the efficiency of all the experimental DSSCs degraded over time due to several factors outlined in the paper. This paper further outlines the advantages of DSSCs for their potential use in buildings in warm regions such as the Middle East and North Africa.

Abstract: Ordered silicon nanocrystals in silicon carbide are produced by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition by means of the multilayer approach followed by annealing at 1100°C. The crystallization is verified by Raman scattering, X-ray diffraction, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and UV–vis spectroscopy. The conditions for the periodic structure to survive the high temperature annealing and for the SiC barrier to confine the Si crystal growth are examined by energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy and X-ray reflection. The final layout appears to be strongly influenced by the structural features of the as-deposited multilayer. Threshold values of Si-rich carbide sublayer thickness and Si-to-C ratio are identified in order to preserve the ordered structure. The crystallized fraction is observed to be correlated with the total silicon volume fraction. The constraints are examined through the use of ab-initio calculations of matrix-embedded silicon nanocrystals, as well as in terms of existing models for nanocrystal formation, in order to establish the role played by the interface energy on nanocrystal outgrowth, residual amorphous fraction, and continuous crystallization. A parameter space of formation of ordered Si nanocrystals is proposed. The diffusivity of carbon in the crystallized material is evaluated, and estimated to be around 10–16cm2/s at 1100°C.

Abstract: The chemical origin of the UV-enhanced conductivity of ZnO nanoparticle thin-films is studied. Improved electrical properties are shown for organic photovoltaics, thin-film transistors and diodes utilizing UV-illuminated nanoparticle ZnO films. Using impedance spectroscopy we find that as prepared ZnO nanoparticle films exhibit clear signatures of grain boundary conduction, which is eliminated following UV illumination in nitrogen atmosphere. Exposure to ambient air is found to increase the grain boundary resistance to its original state after oxygen, then water, adsorb to the surface. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry confirms that, as with bulk ZnO, the UV illumination process results in desorption of oxygen as well as oxidation of carbonaceous species at the surface. Loss of photo-generated holes through this oxidative process results in excess electrons in the ZnO, which in turn produces the observed electronic changes.

Abstract: A consistent body of research has linked cystic fibrosis (CF) with variations in the tissue and fluid content in a number of lipid molecules. However, little is known about the spatial localization of those variations. We have recently applied TOF-SIMS mass spectrometry imaging to detect differential lipid signatures at the colon epithelium between normal and cftr−/− mice. In the present work we have used this technology to investigate potential differences in the spatial distribution of lipids due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.a.) infection in mouse lung expressing or not cftr. Wild-type and exon 10 cftr knockout mice were subjected to intranasal infection with a clinical strain of P.a. Lung cryosections from infected and non-infected mice were subjected to cluster TOF-SIMS analysis in the negative ion mode. We observed a highly specific localization of a phosphoinositol fragment ion at m/z 299.1 in bronchial epithelium. Using this ion to delineate a region of interest, we studied the relative abundance of ions below m/z 1500. We found a significant increase in m/z 465.4 (identified as cholesteryl sulfate) in cftr−/− epithelium and in response to bacterial infection, as well as a decrease in most carboxylic ions. In conclusion, the m/z 299.1 ion can be used as a marker of bronchial epithelium, where P.a. infection leads to increased presence of cholesteryl sulfate in this tissue. TOF-SIMS imaging reveals as a valuable tool for the study of respiratory epithelium. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Cystic Fibrosis: From o-mics to cell biology, physiology, and therapeutic advances.

Abstract: The use of a combined excimer (XeCl=308nm) laser annealing (ELA) and chemical etching process (dubbed the “LaText” process) to generate textured ZnO:Al thin films suitable for thin-film silicon photovoltaic applications has been previously shown, but the evolution of the material during the laser annealing and texturing steps has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we examine in detail the evolution of the properties of room-temperature sputtered ZnO:Al thin films during such a process. We reveal (i) the bulk structural changes induced during laser annealing through X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy, (ii) the dramatic changes in surface morphology and macroscopic electronic properties before and after each step of the LaText process, through Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Hall effect measurements, and (iii) the exceptional light scattering properties of these films in both air and in a cell configuration, as measured by optical transmission and reflection measurements. In all, we show that the electronic transport properties in the final state are acceptable for thin film PV applications, and the optical properties are exceptional and demonstrate great potential for light-trapping performance for both a-Si:H and µc-Si:H solar cells.

Abstract: The reactive ion etching in combination with acidic etching (acidic+RIE) is applied to form the front surface texturing of 156×156mm2 multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers in order to improve the cell efficiency. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses indicate that the RIE process produces dense nanoscale ridge-like structures based on the acidic textured surfaces, and these structures generate an excellent antireflection effect. The matching processes including the post-cleaning, the phosphorus diffusion, and the deposition of silicon nitride (SiNX) antireflection coating are optimized. The acidic+RIE textured surfaces in combination with high sheet resistance emitters result in a remarkable enhancement in short wavelength response and then improve the short circuit current density (JSC) significantly. The absolute conversion efficiency of acidic+RIE textured solar cells is improved 0.51% on average compared to the acidic textured solar cells in mass production, and a maximum full-area cell efficiency of 18.49% is achieved on the mc-Si solar cell with a conventional cell structure.

Abstract: β1-Integrin is a heterodimeric transmembrane protein that has roles in both cell–extra-cellular matrix and cell–cell interactions. Conditional deletion of β1-integrin from all lens cells during embryonic development results in profound lens defects, however, it is less clear whether this reflects functions in the lens epithelium alone or whether this protein plays a role in lens fibers. Thus, a conditional approach was used to delete β1-integrin solely from the lens fiber cells. This deletion resulted in two distinct phenotypes with some lenses exhibiting cataracts while others were clear, albeit with refractive defects. Analysis of “clear” conditional knockout lenses revealed that they had profound defects in fiber cell morphology associated with the loss of the F-actin network. Physiological measurements found that the lens fiber cells had a twofold increase in gap junctional coupling, perhaps due to differential localization of connexins 46 and 50, as well as increased water permeability. This would presumably facilitate transport of ions and nutrients through the lens, and may partially explain how lenses with profound structural abnormalities can maintain transparency. In summary, β1-integrin plays a role in maintaining the cellular morphology and homeostasis of the lens fiber cells.

Abstract: The interfacial reactions and growth kinetics of intermetallic compounds at the solder/sintered Ag metallization interface in silicon solar cells were investigated during solid-state aging. Three common solders (Sn37Pb, Sn36Pb2Ag, and Sn3Ag0.5Cu) were used to conduct several experiments testing the quality of the solder joints in this study. Accelerated tests were performed to determine the long-term reliability of the solder joints. The storage temperatures were 100, 120, 150, and 180±1°C for various aging durations. The results showed that the sintered Ag electrode gradually transformed into an Ag3Sn intermetallic compound (IMC), and the growth kinetics of Ag3Sn remained a diffusion-controlled process during isothermal aging. The formation of Ag3Sn increased the series resistances (RS) of the cell modules because Ag3Sn had a higher electrical resistivity than sintered Ag did. In addition, the results revealed that Sn3Ag0.5Cu PV ribbon effectively slowed down the growth kinetics of Ag3Sn. The apparent activation energies for Ag3Sn at Sn37Pb/sintered Ag, Sn36Pb2Ag/sintered Ag, and Sn3Ag0.5Cu/sintered Ag interfaces were calculated to be 104, 108, and 121KJ/mole, respectively. These kinetics data were established for the first time for the solder alloys commonly used in PV module assembly industry.

Abstract: Small molecule organic solar cells (OSCs) are systematically studied for their photo-stability in an inert N2 environment. In this work, 28-day dark, light-stress and heat-stress experiments are conducted on OSCs with strongly varied mixing ratios. Comparisons are made between the emerging, high performance Schottky device structure and the more widely studied (standard) BHJ structure. In both structures, light stress experiments result in a 10–15% loss in power conversion efficiency. Simultaneous heat-stress experiments demonstrate that these variations are not related to thermally induced changes. Photo-induced losses in open circuit voltages are observed for both device structures and are attributed to organic-electrode degradation. However, variations in the other photovoltaic parameters are more strongly dependent on the active layer composition and associated device structure. Schottky OSCs are shown to be slightly more resilient to variations in short circuit current compared to standard BHJ OSCs, but they suffer from losses in fill factor. Microsecond transient photocurrent and external quantum efficiency measurements are employed to show that these fill factor losses are due to increased recombination, associated with increased trap density by the exciton-induced degradation of the C60 acceptor. This effect may be problematic for all Schottky OSCs due to their use of mixed layers with very high C60 content. The choice of device architecture is thus shown to alter degradation mechanisms, and so it can have implications on the overall OSC photo-stability.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells are prepared by stacking sputtering of precursors and annealing at Se atmosphere. We achieved the highest conversion efficiency of a CZTSSe thin-film solar cell with 8.06%. Local electrical properties of the CZTSSe films were investigated by Kelvin probe force microscopy. We studied samples which show conversion efficiencies between 3.17% and 8.06%. The CZTSSe thin-film with the highest efficiency exhibits predominantly downward potential bending at grain boundaries (GBs) and upward potential bending at intragrains (IGs). On the other hand, the film with the lowest efficiency shows the opposite behaviors that downward potential bending at GBs and upward potential bending in many regions of IGs. The downward potential bending allows minority carrier collection and reduces recombination at GBs, consequently, enhance current in the solar cell devices. However, some of the GBs possesses deep-level traps so they behave as a hurdle for charge transport, which can be compensated with the carrier motion in the IGs. The results suggest that the potential variations on the GBs and IGs are significantly linked to the carrier transport and device characteristics in the solar cells.

Abstract: Efforts in understanding the role of the microenvironment in the development of breast cancer have focused on tumor-stroma cross-talk, but the possibility that normal epithelial cells might also play a role in tumor progression has received little attention. Here, we show that non-tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A and HMEC) secrete factors able to enhance the proliferation of estrogen receptor α (ERα) positive breast cancer cells (MCF7 and T47D) and suppress their ability to undergo apoptosis. Conditioned medium (CM) derived from MCF10A and HMEC cells was capable of activating ERα in a hormone-independent way, by phosphorylating ERα on Ser167. Co-exposure with PI3K and mTORC1 inhibitors significantly reduced the ERα Ser167 phosphorylation and suppressed the proliferation-enhancing effects of both 10A-CM and HMEC-CM on MCF7 cells. We show that MCF10A and HMEC secrete numerous cytokines, among them MCP-1, which was one of the most prevalent. MCP-1 was shown to have a role in the effects elicited by the 10A-CM. It activated the ERα by phosphorylating Ser167 via the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway, an effect which was further confirmed by silencing the MCP-1 receptors, CCR2 and CCR4. To our knowledge, this is the first time MCP-1 has been shown to contribute to ERα signaling activation. These data suggest that normal mammary cells could have the capability of supporting the proliferation of breast cancer cells via paracrine interactions. A better understanding of the role of these cells may be useful for designing strategies for the prevention of tumor progression at early stages.

Abstract: This article introduces an experimental approach to study the aging of absorber materials used in the receivers of CSP power plants. The term ‘aging’ is discussed in the case of solar absorber materials and a definition is suggested. A two-layer material (metal+paint coating) that is commonly used in solar tower receivers is studied. Accelerated aging tests are performed on this material with the Solar Accelerated Aging Facility (SAAF) available at PROMES laboratory (Odeillo, France). To evaluate the aging state of the samples after being solar-treated, the thermoradiative and thermophysical properties that characterize the aging of the coating are estimated with two experimental devices. The results show the influence of the mean irradiance, amplitude, period, and exposure time of the radiative cycles on the estimated properties. The absorptance appears to be the most sensitive property causing the thermal performance to decrease. Particular attention should be paid to the application of the paint coating which needs to be vitrified carefully in order to obtain optimal and stable absorption properties.

Abstract: The use of intrinsic silicon oxide as a buffer layer at the p–i interface of thin-film silicon solar cells is shown to provide significant advantages. For microcrystalline silicon solar cells, when associated with highly crystalline i-layers deposited at high rates, all electrical parameters are improved. Larger efficiency gains are achieved with substrates of increased roughness. For cells with an improved i-layer material quality, there is mainly a gain in short-circuit current density. An improvement in carrier collection in the blue region of the spectrum is systematically observed on all the cells. The presence of a silicon oxide buffer layer also promotes the nucleation of the subsequent intrinsic microcrystalline silicon layer. In amorphous silicon solar cells, the silicon oxide buffer layer is proven to act as an efficient barrier to boron cross-contamination, eliminating the need for additional processing steps (e.g. water vapor flush), while providing a wide bandgap material at the interface. The implementation of silicon oxide buffer layers for both types of cells thus provides a decisive improvement, as it allows extremely fast deposition of the full p–i–n stack of layers of the cell in a single-chamber configuration while providing a high-quality substrate-resilient p–i interface.

Abstract: The need for inexpensive alternative to indium doped tin oxide (ITO) transparent electrodes is imminent for cost-efficient solution processed optoelectronic applications. ITO-free transparent electrodes can be based on inkjet-printed Silver (Ag) nanoparticles grids embedded into PEDOT:PSS buffer layers. We present an in-depth investigation of the morphological evolution of the inkjet printed Ag nanopartricle sintering process combined with an ultimate control of the printed grid design requirements for efficient ITO-free organic photovoltaics (OPVs). We report on glass/ITO-free P3HT:PC60BM and Si-PCPDTBT:PC70BM based OPVs with power conversion efficiency of 2.8% and 4.9% respectively. These devices exhibited minimal losses when compared to reference ITO-based OPVs.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder of the vasculature regulated by cytokines. Amongst the cytokines, IL-33 attenuates the development of atherosclerosis in mouse model systems via several mechanisms, including inhibition of macrophage foam cell formation and promotion of a Th1 to Th2 shift. Proteases produced by macrophages, such as matrix metalloproteinases and members of ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family, play potential roles in regulating atherosclerotic plaque stability. Despite such importance, the action of IL-33 on the expression of such proteases has not been analyzed. We have therefore investigated the effect of IL-33 on the expression of ADAMTS-1, -4 and -5 in human macrophages. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that these three proteases were expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions, particularly by macrophages and, to a lesser extent, by smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. The expression of ADAMTS-1, -4 and -5 in human macrophages was specifically inhibited by IL-33. The action of IL-33 on the expression of these ADAMTS members was mediated through its receptor ST2. IL-33 activated ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and c-Jun, but not p38 MAPK or Akt, in human macrophages. RNA interference assays using a combination of adenoviral encoding small hairpin RNA and small interfering RNA showed a requirement of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, c-Jun, PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ, but not p38α, in the IL-33-inhibited expression of these ADAMTS isoforms. These studies provide novel insights into the expression of ADAMTS-1, -4 and -5 in human atherosclerotic lesions and the regulation of their expression in human macrophages by the key anti-atherogenic cytokine IL-33.

Abstract: The dithiophene donor–acceptor copolymers that are bridged either with carbon (C-PCPDTBT) or silicon atoms (Si-PCPDTBT) belong to a promising family of materials for use in photoactive layers for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). In this work, we implement the non-destructive Spectroscopic Ellipsometry technique in the near infrared to the far ultraviolet spectral region in combination with advanced theoretical modeling to investigate the vertical distribution of the C-PCPDTBT and Si-PCPDTBT polymer and fullerene ([6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester – PC70BM) phases in the blend, as well as the effect of the polymer-to-fullerene ratio on the distribution mechanism. It was found that the C-PCPDTBT:PC70BM blends have donor-enriched top regions and acceptor-enriched bottom regions, whereas the donor and acceptor phases are more homogeneously intermixed in the Si-PCPDTBT:PC70BM blends. We suggest that the chemical incompatibility of the two phases as expressed by the difference in their surface energy, may be a key element in promoting the segregation of the lower surface phase to the top region of the photoactive layer. We found that the increase of the photoactive layer thickness reduces the polymer enrichment at the cathode, producing a more homogeneous phase distribution of donor and acceptor in the bulk that leads to the increase of the OPV efficiency.

Abstract: We present an ab initio study of the diffusion profiles in CdTe of native, Te adatom and vacancy, and anionic non-native interstitial adatoms P, Sb, O, S, and Cl. A high symmetry Wyckoff position, 4(d) site, happens to be a global minimum energy location, only for O and Cl interstitials. Adatoms of P, Sb and S show an asymmetric shape of the energy diffusion barrier with two minima and two maxima in the pathway. The others, O, Cl, and Te interstitial and vacancy, show a symmetric diffusion barrier with a unique maximum and minimum. Diffusion for Te and S interstitials proceeds along the [110] channel in the crystal in a near straight line path. Diffusion for O and Cl proceeds along two nearly straight line paths along [111] and [11–1]. Diffusion for P and Sb are along the [110] channel however they deviate from the straight line paths along [111] and [11–1]. The rate-limiting diffusion barriers range from a low of 0.49eV for the asymmetric diffusion path of an Sb interstitial to a high of 1.51eV for the symmetric diffusion path of an O interstitial. The rate-limiting barriers for the others are 0.65eV for S, 0.68eV for both Cl and P, 1.37eV for Te interstitial and 1.42eV for the Te vacancy. These barriers are in agreement with the available experimental data for interstitials Te 1.40±0.02eV, Cl 0.63±0.10eV and S 0.64±0.02eV. The symmetric or asymmetric nature of the diffusion path as well as the bond length and atomic coordination at the energetic-extrema positions influence the size of the diffusion energy barrier. In addition there exist two electronic signatures in the local density of states: one for the bond breaking in the symmetric diffusion barrier paths and the other in the difference in hybridization between the global minimum and global maximum energy positions for asymmetric diffusion barriers. This work should serve as a motivation for experimental verification of other barriers and elucidates the diffusion mechanisms very difficult to discover experimentally.

Abstract: Transparent conductive hydrogenated Mg and Ga co-doped ZnO (HMGZO) thin films for solar cells were deposited via pulsed direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering on glass substrates at a substrate temperature of 553K. The structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties of HMGZO thin films were investigated with various H2 flow rates. The experiment results showed that the HMGZO thin films are polycrystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite structure exhibiting a preferred (002) crystal plane orientation and typical HMGZO thin films present cone-like texture surface. The carrier concentration rapidly increases from 7.57×1019cm−3 to 5.25×1020cm−3 with increasing the H2 flow rate from 0sccm to 4.0sccm. Optical measurements indicated that the optical band-gap (Eg) of HMGZO thin films varies from 3.43eV to 3.66eV with adjusting H2 flow rate from 0sccm to 4.0sccm. The glass/HMGZO thin film deposited at the H2 flow rate of 4.0sccm exhibits the lowest resistivity of 6.24×10−4Ωcm (sheet resistance Rs~8.68Ω) and an average transmittance (Ta) of 78.8% in the wavelength range from 340nm to 1100nm. Burstein–Moss band-filling, band gap renormalization effects determined by carrier concentrations and the incorporation of Mg atoms together contribute to an Eg widening phenomenon. The electron mobility of HMGZO thin films can be effectively improved through thermal annealing process. Finally, the HMGZO thin film was preliminarily applied in pin a-Si:H thin film solar cell with an efficiency of 8.20% (Voc=0.904V, Jsc=12.906mA/cm2 and FF=0.702).

Abstract: Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), an inherited hepatic disorder, is due to a defect of hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), an enzyme involved in heme biosynthesis. AIP is characterized by recurrent, life-threatening attacks at least partly due to the increased hepatic production of 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA). Both the mitochondrial enzyme, ALA synthase (ALAS) 1, involved in the first step of heme biosynthesis, which is closely linked to mitochondrial bioenergetic pathways, and the promise of an ALAS1 siRNA hepatic therapy in humans, led us to investigate hepatic energetic metabolism in Hmbs KO mice treated with phenobarbital. The mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were explored in the Hmbs−/− mouse model. RC and TCA cycle were significantly affected in comparison to controls in mice treated with phenobarbital with decreased activities of RC complexes I (−52%, ** p<0.01), II (−50%, ** p<0.01) and III (−55%, * p<0.05), and decreased activity of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (−64%, * p<0.05), citrate synthase (−48%, ** p<0.01) and succinate dehydrogenase (−53%, * p<0.05). Complex II-driven succinate respiration was also significantly affected. Most of these metabolic alterations were at least partially restored after the phenobarbital arrest and heme arginate administration. These results suggest a cataplerosis of the TCA cycle induced by phenobarbital, caused by the massive withdrawal of succinyl-CoA by ALAS induction, such that the TCA cycle is unable to supply the reduced cofactors to the RC. This profound and reversible impact of AIP on mitochondrial energetic metabolism offers new insights into the beneficial effect of heme, glucose and ALAS1 siRNA treatments by limiting the cataplerosis of TCA cycle.

Abstract: Tubular daylighting systems are designed to guide light to the building׳s core using a highly reflective pipe. The intensity of the transmitted light is essential for the performance of the system. For the qualitative perception of the provided illumination, the color of the delivered light is also an important aspect. For highly reflective mirror light pipes, spectral variations are generally assumed not to affect the color of the transmitted light. Here, spectrophotometric measurements and ray tracing simulations of mirror light pipes are used to verify this commonly made assumption. The characterization methods employ spectral evaluations for both direct and diffuse incident light. The color properties are evaluated for mirror light pipes with a length to diameter aspect ratio of up to 16, using the CIE chromaticity diagram and CIELAB coordinates. For the xy chromaticity diagram, a larger color shift was noted for different illuminants than as a result of the optical properties of the reflective material. Using the CIELAB coordinates, a small color shift was noted for light incident at low solar altitudes. Overall, highly reflective films with spectral variations of a few percent do not markedly affect the color of the transmitted light.

Abstract: A new electrochromic device (ECD), in which poly(N′,Nʺ,N‴-tris[N,N-bis-(4′-diphenylamino-biphenyl-4-yl)phenyl]-1,3,5-benzene-tricarboxamide) (PG1) acted as the electrochromic film and zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) as an ion storage material, was proposed. ZnHCF was observed to exhibit high charge capacity while maintaining high transparency when undergoing redox reaction. This ECD shows two-stage electrochromism and both transitions exhibit significant transmittance change (>60% at 490 and 740nm). Low-driving voltage (from −0.4 to 0.1V) was also observed when switching in the first transition. This ECD also exhibits a very stable behavior (no significant decay for the transmittance change at 490nm after 4000 cycles) when operating in the first transition.

Abstract: NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ nanocomposites (NCs) are synthesized by a facile solvothermal approach and doped into PCDTBT:PCBM blend as a bifunctional additive to improve peformance of inverted polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The dependence of device performance on NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ NCs in the blend film is investigated. The results show that the short-circuit current density is apparently enhanced by doping NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ NCs into the active layer while maintaining the open-circuit voltage and fill factor, leading to an increase in power conversion efficiency. NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ NCs acts two kinds of roles for light absorption enhancement. Up-conversion (UC) emission from Yb3+ sensitized Er3+ dopants in the NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ NCs is observed. The photocurrent generated from UC near 980nm excitation can improve the utilization of solar photons in the near infrared (NIR). The scattering effect of NaYF4 nanoparticles (NPs) enhances the light absorption in visible region. The performance of polymer solar cell doped with NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ NCs is compared with that of undoped. The concept of integrating UC and scattering functionality into active layer suggests a promising and practical pathway for improving visible and NIR absorption of polymer solar cells.

Abstract: Vertically aligned hierarchical WO3 nano-architectures on transparent conducting substrate (3×2.5cm2 in size and sheet resistance Rs=10Ω) are produced via a template-free solvothermal method. The nanostructured array films with thicknesses of about 1.1μm show remarkable enhancement of the electrochromic properties in visible spectrum and infrared region. In particular, a significant optical modulation (66.5% and 66.0% at 633nm, 73.8% and 53.9% at 2000nm, 57.7% and 51.7% at 8μm), fast switching speed (4.6s/3.6s and 2.0s/3.4s), high coloration efficiency (126 and 120cm2C−1 at 633nm) and excellent cycling stability (maintained 77.5% and 81.7% of the initial optical modulation after 4500-cycles) are achieved for the nanotree and nanowire arrays, respectively. The improved electrochromic properties are mainly attributed to the vertically aligned structure and the porous space among the nanotrees or nanowires, which make the diffusion of H+ in these arrays easier and also supply larger surface area for charge-transfer reactions.

Abstract: Elevated serum levels of a secreted glycoprotein chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1) are associated with poor prognosis and short survival time of patients with cervical cancer (CxCa). Our previous microarray data showed the increased expression of CHI3L1 in invasive CxCa compared to normal tissue, implicating a potential role of CHI3L1 in CxCa. To establish the pathological role of CHI3L1 in the development of CxCa, this study focused on its expression in CxCa and angiogenic impacts in tumor vessel formation. CHI3L1 activated angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro but failed to protect CxCa cell lines, CaSki and HeLa against apoptosis induced by γ-irradiation. In addition, the capability of CHI3L1 to induce proliferation and migration of CaSki and HeLa cells was cell type specific. In an analysis of 103 specimens from CxCa patients, increased expression levels of CHI3L1 mRNA and protein in invasive CxCa were 4-fold (P<0.05) and 2-fold (P<0.01), respectively, stronger than those in normal subjects. The immunostaining of CHI3L1 was positively correlated with VEGF expression (P=0.0019) and microvessel density (P=0.0110). Moreover, CHI3L1 expression was also positively associated with cancer metastasis (P=0.011). The data suggest the crucial role of CHI3L1 by promoting angiogenesis, which may contribute to the development and progression of CxCa. The findings help establish CHI3L1 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for CxCa patients.

Abstract: The stromal derived factor (SDFs) family comprises a group of molecules generated by stromal cells. SDF1 and SDF4 are chemokines; SDF2 and SDF5 are not yet functionally and structurally defined. In human and mouse, Sdf2 has a paralogous gene, Sdf2l1, whose protein sequences are 78% similar and 68% identical. Human SDF2L1 is an endoplasmic reticulum-stress inducible-gene. In Arabidopsis thaliana, SDF2-like (39% and 37% amino acid sequence identity with Mus musculus Sdf2 and Sdf2l1) has also been implicated in activating the UPR in ER-stress. Here we have cloned, expressed and purified recombinant Sdf2 and raised an anti-Sdf2 antibody. We demonstrated that the protein is expressed in several tissues and is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. We suggest that Sdf2, initially predicted as a secretory protein because it lacks the canonical ER retention signals in its C-terminal, could be ER-resident through accessory binding proteins or other amino acid sequence motifs, as suggested for the homolog protein SDF2-like. Furthermore, the crystal structure of SDF2-like from Arabidopsis thaliana is a typical β-trefoil containing three MIR motifs; all hydrophobic residues considered important for maintaining the bottom layer of the β-trefoil barrel seem to be conserved in the Sdf2 family. Multiple alignment using 43 sequences for SDF2 and 38 for SDF2L1 paralogous families also revealed a very similar residue conservation profile. Comparing the amino acid sequence and predicted 3D structure with other Sdf2-like proteins we suggest a role of mouse Sdf2 in the Unfolded Protein Response and ER-stress, similar to that of Sdf2l1 from human and mouse and SDF2-like from Arabidopsis thaliana. Chronic ER stress has been associated with many human diseases including cancer and diabetes. Identification of new factors associated with the ER stress pathway can help to identify and define key targets of this response.

Abstract: Background and objectives
Despite the use of targeted therapy, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) currently remains incurable with drug therapy, with patients requiring life-long treatment. Developing either a vaccine to prevent the disease or another novel drug to specifically target and eradicate the CML cell will require the identification of CML-associated cell-surface markers and molecules that can bind specifically to the cell surface. In an attempt to discover peptides that bind specifically to cells in the early chronic phase of the disease, we used phage-display technology to identify heptapeptides that bind specifically to the surface of BCR/ABL-expressing fibroblasts.
Methods
An in vitro system using NIH3T3 stably transfected with pGD210 (BCR/ABL) was used as a model for the chronic phase of the disease. The cells were panned using a linear heptapeptide phage library (Ph.D 7.0) in a negative/positive panning strategy with NIH3T3 containing only the plasmid vector as the wild type control.
Results
We identified four novel peptides that were enriched through this technique. These peptides contained either multiple proline residues or serine/threonine–proline pairs and showed a confirmed binding preference for BCR/ABL+ fibroblasts. The peptide Y-R-A-P-W-P-P also showed a binding affinity for granulocytes from untreated CML patients.
Conclusion
We have identified several novel peptides that can be used in future studies to identify specific CML cell-surface antigens or provide a novel drug-delivery mechanism.

Abstract: Four applications of real-time spectroscopic ellipsometry (RTSE) and ex-situ mapping spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) in thin-film hydrogenated silicon (Si:H) photovoltaics (PV) technology are reviewed with the common theme being the development and application of SE-derived growth evolution diagrams. The goals of these applications are to understand and consequently further advance this technology. In the first application, fabrication of engineered thin films consisting of periodic arrays of silicon (Si) nanocrystallites in an amorphous Si:H (a-Si:H) host matrix has been guided by a growth evolution diagram developed by RTSE for radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) using SiH4+H2 mixtures. Such precisely controlled microstructures are of interest as possible intrinsic-layer components of p–i–n and n–i–p thin-film PV devices, and RTSE is shown to be a key technique for guidance in fabrication and for structure verification. In the second application of growth evolution diagrams, very-high-frequency PECVD intrinsic a-Si:H, hydrogenated amorphous silicon–germanium alloys (a-Si1−xGex:H), and hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) have been investigated for use as the top, middle, and bottom-cell i-layer components, respectively, of triple-junction n–i–p solar cells. The growth evolution diagram for the bottom-cell i-layer, starting from an underlying mixed-phase amorphous+nanocrystalline silicon [(a+nc)-Si:H] n-layer, reveals a bifurcation at a critical H2-dilution flow ratio R (R=[H2]/[Si2H6], in this application) between mixed-to-amorphous phase evolution [(a+nc)→a] at low R and mixed-to-nanocrystalline phase evolution [(a+nc)→nc] at high R. The highest performance single-step nc-Si:H solar cell is found at minimal R while remaining on the nanocrystalline side of the identified bifurcation where suitable grain boundary passivation can be assured. Because of the importance of the roll-to-roll flexible substrate configuration in such multijunction Si:H-based PV technology, RTSE has been demonstrated in a third application for monitoring PECVD of a-Si:H n–i–p solar cell structures on back-reflector-coated flexible roll-to-roll polymer substrates. RTSE has been used for probing along the center line of the moving substrate during deposition, and ex-situ mapping SE has been used over the full substrate area after deposition. Detailed studies of the top-most p-layer of the n–i–p solar cell have been performed, with the goal being to develop spatially-dependent (in contrast to R-dependent) growth evolution diagrams in order to evaluate uniformity across the width of the substrate and thus to enable optimization of the resulting a-Si:H PV modules. In this study, efficiency optimization occurs at the p-layer transition region in which a-Si:H nucleates from the i-layer surface, but evolves to predominantly nc-Si:H for improved contact to the top-most In2O3:Sn layer. In the fourth and final application reviewed here, the mapping-SE-deduced properties of the Si:H i and p-layers have been spatially correlated with device performance parameters from an array of n–i–p a-Si:H-based dot cells over a 13×13cm2 substrate area. Analysis of the SE data acquired over the full area provides property maps of i-layer thickness and band gap, p-layer thickness and band gap, and p-layer surface roughness thickness for the n–i–p structure. The mapped values adjacent to the PV devices have been correlated with the device performance parameters. When sufficient non-uniformity exists, these correlations enable optimization based on specific ranges of values that characterize the fundamental properties of the material and the film structure.

Abstract: An optical model is presented to determine the constraints imparted by self-absorption on the luminescence emitted from down-conversion (DC) materials. An analytical formula was derived demonstrating that, for a given DC material, an optimal thickness exists that maximizes the intensity of the emitted radiation, while minimizing the impact of self-absorption. This defines a new limit for the optical efficiency of a DC material that is governed by its geometry. Subsequently, the model was validated through experimental analysis of a specific down-converting borate glass co-doped with Ce3+–Yb3+, whose optimal thickness has been determined to be 0.83mm. The model clarifies the origin of the disparity between the theoretical and the experimental efficiencies reported for some materials. The results from this work assist with the design and implementation of DC layers for photovoltaic devices, as well as providing a framework for optimization of DC materials to other fields of optics and photonics.

Abstract: Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) decreases cell proliferation through PI3K signalling and prevents tumour progression in clear renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here we analyzed the signalling pathways that mediate such VIP effects by using human RCC A498 cells. The effects of treatment with 1μM VIP and/or specific protein kinase inhibitors such as H89, Wortmannin and PD98059 were studied by cell adhesion assay, ELISA of VEGF165 and ROS production assays. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and western blot were performed to study p53 expression. VIP increased cell adhesion and ROS production, and decreased VEGF165 secretion through PI3K signalling. Moreover, VIP increased nuclear expression of tumour suppressor p53. VIP effects could be blocked by cell incubation with a specific p53 inhibitor, cyclin pifithrin-α hydrobromide (CPFT-αH). In conclusion, this study provides a p53-dependent mechanism by which VIP regulates cell proliferation in RCC development. It supports a potential usefulness of VIP in new therapies of RCC.

Abstract: The authors investigate the influence of molecular orientation of p-type molecules of alpha-sexithiophene (α-6T) and n-type molecules of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic bisbenzimidazole (PTCBI) on organic solar cell (OSC) performance. Deposition of α-6T and subsequently PTCBI on an α-6T buffer surface rubbed with a nylon cloth allows their horizontal orientations to be formed in separate layers. Power conversion efficiency and operation stability of a rubbed OSC are markedly improved when compared with an unrubbed OSC. The improved OSC performance is confirmed to be due to increases in light absorption, exciton diffusion length, energy difference between the p-type and n-type layers, and carrier collection by electrodes, which are caused by the rubbing-induced double horizontal orientations.

Abstract: Hepatic stimulatory substance (HSS), which encodes a sulfhydryl oxidase enzyme, promotes liver regeneration (LR) and maintains the viability of hepatocytes. Surprisingly, we found that the levels of the HSS mRNA and expressed protein were both strongly repressed at 12h after a 70% partial hepatectomy (PH) in mice. Understanding the mechanism and effect of this extraordinary suppression can provide a novel path for exploring the molecular function of HSS during LR. We observed that the EGF levels in the serum were negatively correlated with HSS expression in regenerating livers. Treating primary mouse hepatocytes or Hepa1-6 cells with EGF suppressed HSS mRNA expression. This suppression was transcriptional and was mediated by the effect of EGF on the phosphorylation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), which regulates HSS expression. We further showed that the enhanced phosphorylation of C/EBPβ after PH promoted its interaction with the HSS promoter and repressed HSS expression at early time-points after PH. Interestingly, the knockdown of HSS caused a dramatic decrease in E-cadherin expression in hepatocytes. E-cadherin expression was also significantly suppressed at 12h after PH. Moreover, the pre-injection of HSS-expressing adenovirus vectors prevented E-cadherin suppression after PH. Treatment with C/EBPβ siRNA reversed the EGF-mediated inhibition of HSS expression and led to enhanced E-cadherin expression and reduced cell migration. Our findings suggest that C/EBPβ directly inhibits the HSS promoter after PH and that this inhibition can downregulate E-cadherin expression. These data provide novel insight into the potential role of HSS in hepatic structural reconstruction during LR.

Abstract: Hyaluronan (HA), a natural extracellular matrix component, has been considered as an important constituent of the stem cell niche, and successfully used as 3D scaffolds for the chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells. However, the expression levels of HA synthases (HAS1, 2 and 3) and the synthesis of HA by stem cells have remained unknown, and were studied here in the human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Nine hMSCs from different donors were cultured as monolayers with MSC culture medium supplemented with FGF-2. The amount of HA secreted into medium was studied by an ELISA-type assay, and HA bound to cell surface by live cell microscopy. The expression of HASs was analyzed by real time RT-PCR and immunostainings. The HA receptor CD44 was studied by immunocytochemistry. An intense HA coat surrounded the plasma membrane and its protrusions in all nine hMSCs. Displacement assay with HA oligosaccharides indicated that HA coat was at least partly dependent on CD44, which showed similar, relatively high expression in all hMSCs. All HAS isoenzymes were detected, HAS1 showing the largest and HAS3 the smallest range of expression levels between the hMSCs. The secretion of HA ranged between 22.5 and 397.4ng/10,000cells/24h, and could not be clearly assigned to the mRNA level of a certain HAS, or a combination of the isoenzymes. This suggests that post-transcriptional and post-translational factors were involved in the adjustment of the HA secretion. In conclusion, all hMSCs expressed high levels of HAS1–3, secrete large amounts of HA, and surround themselves with a thick HA coat bound to CD44. The results suggest that hMSC has the potential for autocrine maintenance of the HA niche, important for their stemness.

Abstract: This work presents hybrid bulk heterojunction solar cells based on blends of Z907-modified ZnO nanorods and poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). ZnO nanorods were synthesized by a low temperature hydrothermal method and chemically modified with Z907 through a reflux process. Transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer, infrared spectrometer, UV–vis spectrophotometer, fluorescence spectrometer and photovoltaic device measurements were used to study the morphology, structure, dye binding mode, light absorption, charge transfer and device performance of the structures consisting of P3HT polymer in contact with Z907-modified ZnO nanorods. Results show that Z907 grafting improves the compatibility between ZnO nanorods and P3HT and has not substantially altered the crystal structure of ZnO nanorods. In addition, each Z907 molecule is chemically grafted onto the ZnO surface with two carboxylic acid groups in a unidentate binding mode. Moreover, Z907 modification enlarges the visible light absorption range of ZnO/P3HT composite film and enhances the charge transfer efficiency at the P3HT/ZnO interface. The power conversion efficiency of the P3HT/Z907–ZnO solar cells at a Z907 concentration of 0.3mM under 100mW/cm2 of AM 1.5 illumination is 0.21%.
