Abstract: Summary
Differential host responses in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) remain poorly characterized. Here, we use next-generation sequencing to longitudinally analyze blood samples from pediatric patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C across three hospitals. Profiling of plasma cell-free nucleic acids uncovers distinct signatures of cell injury and death between COVID-19 and MIS-C, with increased multiorgan involvement in MIS-C encompassing diverse cell types, including endothelial and neuronal cells, and an enrichment of pyroptosis-related genes. Whole-blood RNA profiling reveals upregulation of similar pro-inflammatory pathways in COVID-19 and MIS-C but also MIS-C-specific downregulation of T cell-associated pathways. Profiling of plasma cell-free RNA and whole-blood RNA in paired samples yields different but complementary signatures for each disease state. Our work provides a systems-level view of immune responses and tissue damage in COVID-19 and MIS-C and informs future development of new disease biomarkers.

Abstract: Summary
Here we describe a novel neuro-mesodermal assembloid model that recapitulates aspects of peripheral nervous system (PNS) development such as neural crest cell (NCC) induction, migration, and sensory as well as sympathetic ganglion formation. The ganglia send projections to the mesodermal as well as neural compartment. Axons in the mesodermal part are associated with Schwann cells. In addition, peripheral ganglia and nerve fibers interact with a co-developing vascular plexus, forming a neurovascular niche. Finally, developing sensory ganglia show response to capsaicin indicating their functionality. The presented assembloid model could help to uncover mechanisms of human NCC induction, delamination, migration, and PNS development. Moreover, the model could be used for toxicity screenings or drug testing. The co-development of mesodermal and neuroectodermal tissues and a vascular plexus along with a PNS allows us to investigate the crosstalk between neuroectoderm and mesoderm and between peripheral neurons/neuroblasts and endothelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
T cell receptor (TCR) technologies, including repertoire analyses and T cell engineering, are increasingly important in the clinical management of cellular immunity in cancer, transplantation, and other immune diseases. However, sensitive and reliable methods for repertoire analyses and TCR cloning are still lacking. Here, we report on SEQTR, a high-throughput approach to analyze human and mouse repertoires that is more sensitive, reproducible, and accurate as compared with commonly used assays, and thus more reliably captures the complexity of blood and tumor TCR repertoires. We also present a TCR cloning strategy to specifically amplify TCRs from T cell populations. Positioned downstream of single-cell or bulk TCR sequencing, it allows time- and cost-effective discovery, cloning, screening, and engineering of tumor-specific TCRs. Together, these methods will accelerate TCR repertoire analyses in discovery, translational, and clinical settings and permit fast TCR engineering for cellular therapies.

Abstract: Mammary gland hyperplasia is one of the risk factors for breast cancer. Till date, there is no study that has addressed the effect of hemin in this condition. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of the heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) inducer (hemin) and its inhibitor (zinc protoporphyrin-IX) (ZnPP-IX) on mammary gland hyperplasia (MGH) induced by estrogen and progesterone in adult albino rats. Forty adult female albino rats were divided into the control group, MGH group, MGH + Hemin group, and MGH + Hemin + ZnPP-IX group. Serum levels of estradiol and progesterone were measured. Breast tissues were taken for estimation of oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers. Mammary gland histology was performed, and expression of Ki-67, Beclin, and P53 in breast tissue was also measured. Estrogen and progesterone administration induced hyperplasia of cells lining the ducts of the breast tissues associated with increased diameter and height of the nipples as well as increased oxidative stress markers, inflammatory markers, antiapoptotic markers, and cell autophagy. Hemin administration during induction of MGH can reverse all the affected parameters. Then, these effects were abolished by ZnPP-IX administration. We concluded that hemin administration can antagonize the cell stress induced by estrogen and progesterone and protect against the development of mammary gland hyperplasia via modulation of Nrf2/HO-1 and NF-κB pathways.

Abstract: The retina may undergo structural and functional damage as a result of hypoxia, which could lead to permanent blindness. As competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), lncRNAs are essential in eye disorders. The biological function of lncRNA MALAT 1 and its potential mechanisms in hypoxic-ischemic retinal diseases are still unknown. MALAT 1 and miR-625–3p expression alterations in hypoxia-treated RPE cells were examined using qRT-PCR. The target binding relationships between MALAT 1 and miR-625–3p, as well as between miR-625–3p and HIF-1α, were identified utilizing bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter assay. We observed that si-MALAT 1 and miR-625–3p mimic both reduced apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hypoxic RPE cells, whereas si-MALAT 1 was reversed by miR-625–3p inhibitor. Further, we carried out a mechanistic investigation, and rescue assays demonstrated that MALAT 1 sponging miR-625–3p influenced HIF-1α expression and consequently took part in the NF-κB/Snail signaling pathway, which regulated apoptosis and EMT. In conclusion, our research had shown that the MALAT 1/miR-625–3p/HIF-1α axis drove the progression of hypoxic-ischemic retinal disorders and may serve as a promising predictive biomarker for their therapeutic and diagnostic targets.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality and lies third in terms of morbidity due to the limited number of effective druggable targets. Since cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be one of the roots of tumorigenesis, outgrowth and metastasis, targeting CSCs may be a promising strategy to reverse the malignant phenotypes of CRC. Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) has been reported to be involved in the self-renewal of CSCs in various cancers, rendering it an attractive potential target against CSCs to consequently limit the malignant phenotypes in CRC. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether CDK12 can be a potential therapeutic target for patients with CRC and clarify its underlying mechanism. We found that CDK12, but not CDK13 is required for CRC survival. CDK12 was found to drive tumor initiation according to the colitis-associated colorectal cancer mouse model. In addition, CDK12 promoted CRC outgrowth and hepatic metastasis in the subcutaneous allograft and liver metastasis mouse models, respectively. In particular, CDK12 was able to induce the self-renewal of CRC CSCs. Mechanistically, the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling mediated by CDK12 was implicated in stemness regulation and malignant phenotype maintenance. These findings indicate that CDK12 is a candidate druggable target in CRC. Therefore, the CDK12 inhibitor SR-4835 warrants clinical trial testing in patients with CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Solid tumors are regarded as complex evolving systems rather than simple diseases. Self-adaptive synthetic therapeutics are required to cope with the challenges of entire tumors; however, limitations in accurate positioning and destruction of hypoxic niches seriously hinder complete tumor eradication. In this study, we engineer a molecular nanoassembly of sorafenib and a hypoxia-sensitive cyanine probe (CNO) to facilitate periphery/center synergistic cancer therapies. The self-adaptive nanoassembly with cascade drug release features not only effectively kills the peripheral tumor cells in normoxic rims but precisely illuminates hypoxic niches following the reduction of CNO by nitroreductase. More important, CNO is found to synergistically induce tumor ferroptosis with sorafenib via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) depletion in hypoxic niches. As expected, the engineered nanoassembly demonstrates self-adaptive hypoxic illumination and periphery/center synergetic tumor eradication in colon and breast cancer BALB/c mouse xenograft models. This study advances turn-on hypoxia illumination and chemo-ferroptosis toward clinical applicability.

Abstract: Summary
Respiratory complex I is a multicomponent enzyme conserved between eukaryotic cells and many bacteria, which couples oxidation of electron donors and quinone reduction with proton pumping. Here, we report that protein transport via the Cag type IV secretion system, a major virulence factor of the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori, is efficiently impeded by respiratory inhibition. Mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, including well-established insecticidal compounds, selectively kill H. pylori, while other Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, such as the close relative Campylobacter jejuni or representative gut microbiota species, are not affected. Using a combination of different phenotypic assays, selection of resistance-inducing mutations, and molecular modeling approaches, we demonstrate that the unique composition of the H. pylori complex I quinone-binding pocket is the basis for this hypersensitivity. Comprehensive targeted mutagenesis and compound optimization studies highlight the potential to develop complex I inhibitors as narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents against this pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are considered innate counterparts of adaptive T cells; however, their common and unique transcriptional signatures in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (pIBD) are largely unknown. Here, we report a dysregulated colonic ILC composition in pIBD colitis that correlates with inflammatory activity, including accumulation of naive-like CD45RA+CD62L− ILCs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) reveals modules of genes that are shared or unique across innate and adaptive lymphocytes. Shared modules include genes associated with activation/tissue residency, naivety/quiescence, and antigen presentation. Lastly, nearest-neighbor-based analysis facilitates the identification of “most inflamed” and “least inflamed” lymphocytes in pIBD colon with unique transcriptional signatures. Our study reveals shared and unique transcriptional signatures of colonic ILCs and T cells in pIBD. We also provide insight into the transcriptional regulation of colonic inflammation, deepening our understanding of the potential mechanisms involved in pIBD.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical genetic approaches have had a transformative impact on discovery of drug targets for malaria but have primarily been used for parasite targets. To identify human pathways required for intrahepatic development of parasite, we implemented multiplex cytological profiling of malaria infected hepatocytes treated with liver stage active compounds. Some compounds, including MMV1088447 and MMV1346624, exhibited profiles similar to cells treated with nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) agonist/antagonists. siRNAs targeting human NHRs, or their signaling partners identified eight genes that were critical for Plasmodium berghei infection. Knockdown of NR1D2, a host NHR, significantly impaired parasite growth by downregulation of host lipid metabolism. Importantly, treatment with MMV1088447 and MMV1346624 but not other antimalarials, phenocopied the lipid metabolism defect of NR1D2 knockdown. Our data underlines the use of high-content imaging for host-cellular pathway deconvolution, highlights host lipid metabolism as a drug-able human pathway and provides new chemical biology tools for studying host-parasite interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial dysfunction involving mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, but understanding is limited for rare early-onset conditions. Loss of the MAM-resident protein WFS1 causes Wolfram syndrome (WS), a rare early-onset neurodegenerative disease that has been linked to mitochondrial abnormalities. Here we demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal cells of WS patients. VDAC1 is identified to interact with WFS1, whereas loss of this interaction in WS cells could compromise mitochondrial function. Restoring WFS1 levels in WS cells reinstates WFS1-VDAC1 interaction, which correlates with an increase in MAMs and mitochondrial network that could positively affect mitochondrial function. Genetic rescue by WFS1 overexpression or pharmacological agents modulating mitochondrial function improves the viability and bioenergetics of WS neurons. Our data implicate a role of WFS1 in regulating mitochondrial functionality and highlight a therapeutic intervention for WS and related rare diseases with mitochondrial defects.

Abstract: Summary
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a multifactorial, chronic relapsing disease associated with genetic and environmental factors. Among skin microbes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are associated with AD, but how genetic variability and staphylococcal strains shape the disease remains unclear. We investigated the skin microbiome of an AD cohort (n = 54) as part of a prospective natural history study using shotgun metagenomic and whole genome sequencing, which we analyzed alongside publicly available data (n = 473). AD status and global geographical regions exhibited associations with strains and genomic loci of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. In addition, antibiotic prescribing patterns and within-household transmission between siblings shaped colonizing strains. Comparative genomics determined that S. aureus AD strains were enriched in virulence factors, whereas S. epidermidis AD strains varied in genes involved in interspecies interactions and metabolism. In both species, staphylococcal interspecies genetic transfer shaped gene content. These findings reflect the staphylococcal genomic diversity and dynamics associated with AD.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the effect of doxorubicin and tunicamycin treatment alone or in combination on MDM-, Cul9-and prion protein (PrP)-mediated subcellular regulation of p53 in the context of apoptosis and autophagy. MTT analysis was performed to determine the cytotoxic effect of the agents. Apoptosis was monitorized by ELISA, flow cytometry and JC-1 assay. Monodansylcadaverine assay was performed for autophagy. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to determine p53, MDM2, CUL9 and PrP levels. Doxorubicin increased p53, MDM2 and CUL9 levels in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of p53 and MDM2 was higher at the 0.25 μM concentration of tunicamycin compared to the control, but it decreased at 0.5 μM and 1 μM concentrations. CUL9 expression was significantly decreased only after treatment of tunicamycin at 0.25 μM. According to its glycosylation status, the upper band of PrP increased only in combination treatment. In combination treatment, p53 expression was higher than control, whereas MDM2 and CUL9 expressions were decreased. Combination treatments may make MCF-7 cells more susceptible to apoptosis rather than autophagy. In conclusion, PrP may be important in determining the fate of cell death through crosstalk between proteins such as p53 and MDM2 under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions. Further studies are needed to obtain in-depth information on these potential molecular networks.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium imaging provides advantages in monitoring large populations of neuronal activities simultaneously. However, it lacks the signal quality provided by neural spike recording in traditional electrophysiology. To address this issue, we developed a supervised data-driven approach to extract spike information from calcium signals. We propose the ENS2 (effective and efficient neural networks for spike inference from calcium signals) system for spike-rate and spike-event predictions using ΔF/F0 calcium inputs based on a U-Net deep neural network. When testing on a large, ground-truth public database, it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms in both spike-rate and spike-event predictions with reduced computational load. We further demonstrated that ENS2 can be applied to analyses of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex neurons. We conclude that it would be a versatile inference system that may benefit diverse neuroscience studies.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas-based diagnostics have the potential to elevate nucleic acid detection. CRISPR-Cas systems can be combined with a pre-amplification step in a one-pot reaction to simplify the workflow and reduce carryover contamination. Here, we report an engineered Cas12b with improved thermostability that falls within the optimal temperature range (60°C–65°C) of reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Using de novo structural analyses, we introduce mutations to wild-type BrCas12b to tighten its hydrophobic cores, thereby enhancing thermostability. The one-pot detection assay utilizing the engineered BrCas12b, called SPLENDID (single-pot LAMP-mediated engineered BrCas12b for nucleic acid detection of infectious diseases), exhibits robust trans-cleavage activity up to 67°C in a one-pot setting. We validate SPLENDID clinically in 80 serum samples for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 66 saliva samples for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with high specificity and accuracy. We obtain results in as little as 20 min, and with the extraction process, the entire assay can be performed within an hour.

Abstract: Background
Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic switching contributes to VSMC proliferation and migration in atherosclerosis (AS). Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanism of VSMC phenotypic switching during AS progression is unclear. Here, the role and regulatory mechanism of UCHL5 in VSMC phenotypic switching during AS progression were investigated.
Methods
ApoE−/− mice were fed with high fat diet to establish AS model in vivo. VSMCs stimulated by ox-LDL were used as AS cellular model. VSMC proliferation and migration were examined by CCK8 assay and transwell assay, respectively. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were assessed using ELISA. The interactions between METTL14/YTHDF1, UCHL5 and NLRP3 were analyzed using RIP and/or dual-luciferase reporter gene and/or Co-IP assays. NLRP3 ubiquitination was analyzed by ubiquitination analysis.
Results
UCHL5 was significantly upregulated in AS patients and ox-LDL-treated VSMCs. UCHL5 silencing ameliorated plaque formation and vascular remodeling in vivo and suppressed ox-LDL-induced VSMC proliferation, migration, inflammation and phenotypic switching in vitro. Moreover, METTL14 could increase UCHL5 mRNA m6A level and promoted UCHL5 expression by recruiting YTHDF1. Moreover, UCHL5 overexpression enhanced protein stability by deubiquitinating NLRP3. Rescue studies revealed that NLRP3 overexpression abrogated UCHL5 silencing-mediated biological effects in ox-LDL-treated VSMCs.
Conclusion

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells that can differentiate into various mature blood cells and immune cells, thus reconstituting hematopoiesis. By taking advantage of the tremendous potential of HSCs, varied hereditary and hematologic diseases are promised to be alleviated or cured. To solve the contradiction between the growing demand for HSCs in disease treatment and the low population of HSCs in both cord blood and bone marrow, ex vivo HSC expansion along with multiple protocols has been investigated for harvesting adequate HSCs over the past two decades. This review surveys the state-of-the-art techniques for ex vivo HSC self-renewal and provides a concise summary of the effects of diverse intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the expansion of HSCs. The remaining challenges and emerging opportunities in the field of HSC expansion are also presented.

Abstract: We aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of circ_0008896 in Atherosclerosis (AS) by using oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced human aortic endothelial cell (HAECs). Levels of genes and proteins were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Functional experiments, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis, cell counting kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU), flow cytometry, tube formation assays and the detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) generation, were performed to investigate the role of circ_0008896 on ox-LDL-induced HAEC damage. Circ_0008896 was increased in AS patients and ox-LDL-stimulated HAECs. Functionally, circ_0008896 knockdown reversed ox-LDL-induced inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis as well as arrest of proliferation and angiogenesis in HAECs in vitro. Mechanistically, circ_0008896 functioned as a sponge for miR-188-3p to relieve the repression of miR-188-3p on its target NOD2. A series of rescue experiments showed that miR-188-3p inhibition attenuated the protective effects of circ_0008896 knockdown on ox-LDL-stimulated HAECs, and NOD2 overexpression abolished the beneficial action of miR-188-3p in the suppression of inflammatory response and oxidative stress, and the promotion of cell growth and angiogenesis in HAECs under ox-LDL treatment. Circ_0008896 silencing attenuates ox-LDL-induced inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and growth arrest in HAECs in vitro, adding further understanding for the pathogenesis of AS.

Abstract: Summary
Development of new non-addictive analgesics requires advanced strategies to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into relevant cell types. Following principles of developmental biology and translational applicability, here we developed an efficient stepwise differentiation method for peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors. By modulating specific cell signaling pathways, hPSCs were first converted into SOX10+ neural crest, followed by differentiation into sensory neurons. Detailed characterization, including ultrastructural analysis, confirmed that the hPSC-derived nociceptors displayed cellular and molecular features comparable to native dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and expressed high-threshold primary sensory neuron markers, transcription factors, neuropeptides, and over 150 ion channels and receptors relevant for pain research and axonal growth/regeneration studies (e.g., TRPV1, NAV1.7, NAV1.8, TAC1, CALCA, GAP43, DPYSL2, NMNAT2). Moreover, after confirming robust functional activities and differential response to noxious stimuli and specific drugs, a robotic cell culture system was employed to produce large quantities of human sensory neurons, which can be used to develop nociceptor-selective analgesics.

Abstract: Summary
Therapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to the poor clinical outcomes of patients with recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) who fail standard of care (SOC) therapy. ChemoID is a clinically validated assay for identifying CSC-targeted cytotoxic therapies in solid tumors. In a randomized clinical trial (NCT03632135), the ChemoID assay, a personalized approach for selecting the most effective treatment from FDA-approved chemotherapies, improves the survival of patients with rGBM (2016 WHO classification) over physician-chosen chemotherapy. In the ChemoID assay-guided group, median survival is 12.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.2–14.7) compared with 9 months (95% CI, 4.2–13.8) in the physician-choice group (p = 0.010) as per interim efficacy analysis. The ChemoID assay-guided group has a significantly lower risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.24–0.81; p = 0.008). Results of this study offer a promising way to provide more affordable treatment for patients with rGBM in lower socioeconomic groups in the US and around the world.

Abstract: Hematopoietic toxicity due to ionizing radiation (IR) is a leading cause of death in nuclear incidents, occupational hazards, and cancer therapy. Oxymatrine (OM), an extract originating from the root of Sophora flavescens (Kushen), possesses extensive pharmacological properties. In this study, we demonstrate that OM treatment accelerates hematological recovery and increases the survival rate of mice subjected to irradiation. This outcome is accompanied by an increase in functional hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), resulting in enhanced hematopoietic reconstitution abilities. Mechanistically, we observed significant activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, accelerated cellular proliferation, and decreased cell apoptosis. Notably, we identified marked increases in the cell cycle transcriptional regulator Cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) and the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 in HSCs after OM treatment. Further investigation revealed that the expression of Ccnd1 transcript and BCL2 levels were reversed upon specific inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, effectively negating the rescuing effect of OM. Moreover, we determined that targeted inhibition of ERK1/2 activation significantly counteracted the regenerative effect of OM on human HSCs. Taken together, our results suggest a crucial role for OM in hematopoietic reconstitution following IR via MAPK signaling pathway-mediated mechanisms, providing theoretical support for innovative therapeutic applications of OM in addressing IR-induced injuries in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Mpox virus (MPXV) caused a multi-country outbreak in non-endemic areas in 2022. Following historic success of smallpox vaccination with vaccinia virus (VACV)-based vaccines, the third generation modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine was used as prophylaxis for MPXV, but its effectiveness remains poorly characterized. Here, we applied two assays to quantify neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in sera from control, MPXV-infected, or MVA-vaccinated individuals. Various levels of MVA NAbs were detected after infection, historic smallpox, or recent MVA vaccination. MPXV was minimally sensitive to neutralization. However, addition of complement enhanced detection of responsive individuals and NAb levels. Anti-MVA and -MPXV NAbs were observed in 94% and 82% of infected individuals, respectively, and 92% and 56% of MVA vaccinees, respectively. NAb titers were higher in individuals born before 1980, highlighting the impact of historic smallpox vaccination on humoral immunity. Altogether, our results indicate that MPXV neutralization is complement dependent and uncover mechanisms underlying vaccine effectiveness.

Abstract: It is hard to reconstruct bone defects in peri-implantitis due to osteogenesis inhibited by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferroptosis, a recently identified regulated cell death characterized by iron- and ROS- dependent lipid peroxidation, provides us with a new explanation. Our study aims to explore whether ferroptosis is involved in peri-implantitis-inhibited osteogenesis and confirm ebselen, an antioxidant with glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-like activity, could inhibit ferroptosis and promote osteogenesis in peri-implantitis. In this study, we used LPS to mimic the microenvironment of peri-implantitis. The osteogenic differentiation of bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) was assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Alizarin Red S, and mRNA and protein expression of osteogenic-related markers. Ferroptosis index analysis included iron metabolism, ROS production, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial morphological changes. Iron overload, reduced antioxidant capability, excessive ROS, lipid peroxidation and the characteristic mitochondrial morphological changes of ferroptosis were observed in LPS-treated BMSCs, and adding Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) restored the inhibitory effect of ferroptosis on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Furthermore, ebselen ameliorated LPS-induced ferroptosis and osteogenic inhibition, which were reversed by erastin. Our results demonstrated that ferroptosis is involved in osteogenic inhibition in peri-implantitis and ebselen could attenuate osteogenic dysfunction of BMSCs via inhibiting ferroptosis.

Abstract: Summary
As observed in several previous studies, integrating more molecular modalities in multi-omics cancer survival models may not always improve model accuracy. In this study, we compared eight deep learning and four statistical integration techniques for survival prediction on 17 multi-omics datasets, examining model performance in terms of overall accuracy and noise resistance. We found that one deep learning method, mean late fusion, and two statistical methods, PriorityLasso and BlockForest, performed best in terms of both noise resistance and overall discriminative and calibration performance. Nevertheless, all methods struggled to adequately handle noise when too many modalities were added. In summary, we confirmed that current multi-omics survival methods are not sufficiently noise resistant. We recommend relying on only modalities for which there is known predictive value for a particular cancer type until models that have stronger noise-resistance properties are developed.

Abstract: Discovery of CARF (Collaborator of ARF)/CDKN2AIP as an ARF-interacting protein that promotes ARF-p53-p21WAF1 signaling and cellular senescence, initially established its role in genomic stress. Multiple reports further unraveled its role in regulation of senescence, growth arrest, apoptosis, or malignant transformation of cells in response to a variety of stress conditions in cultured human cells. It has been established as an essential protein. Whereas CARF-compromised cells undergo apoptosis, its enrichment has been recorded in a variety of cancer cells and has been associated with malignant transformation. We earlier demonstrated its role in stress-induced cell phenotypes that ranged from growth arrest, apoptosis, or malignant transformation. In the present study, we assessed the molecular mechanism of quantitative impact of change in CARF expression level on these cell fates. Stress-induced changes in CARF expression were assessed quantitatively with proteins involved in proteotoxicity, oxidative, genotoxic, and cytotoxic stress. These comparative quantitative analyses confirmed that (i) CARF responds to diverse stresses in a quantitative manner, (ii) its expression level serves as a reliable predictive measure of cell fates (iii) it correlates more with the DNA damage and MDA levels than the oxidative and proteotoxic signatures and (iv) CARF-expression based quantitative assay may be recruited for stress diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Ring Finger Protein 113 (RNF113A), an ubiquitin E3 ligase, is genetically associated with many biological processes, including proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and neurogenesis. Recently, RNF113A has been found to be an abnormal expression in many diseases, such as X-linked trichothiodystrophy syndrome and esophageal cancer. Here, we explore the potential mechanism of RNF113A in the progression of cervical cancer (CC). In this study, we evaluated the expression level and biological function of RNF113A in CC both in vitro and in vivo by bioinformatic prediction, DIA proteomic analysis, compensation experiment, Co-IP, dual-luciferase reporter assay and nude mouse xenograft to identify the RNF113A-associated autophagy pathways involved with tumorigenesis. Consistent with the prediction from biological information analysis, we found that RNF113A was highly expressed in human CC tissues and cells. In addition, this study illustrated that the high expression of RNF113A dramatically promoted proliferation and suppressed autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, low expression of RNF113A enhanced autophagy activities and inhibited tumor growth in CC. We also found that miRNA-197, the level of which (negative correlation with RNF113A) declined in human CC, directly restrained the expression of RNF113A. Mechanistically, proteomic and mechanistic assays uncovered that RNF113A confirmed as the direct downstream target of miR-197, promoted proliferation and restrained autophagy in CC not through direct ubiquitination degradation of autophagy marker Beclin1 but via CXCR4/CXCL12/AKT/ERK/Beclin1 signal transduction axis. In summary, we found a new miR-197/RNF113 A/CXCR4/CXCL12/AKT/ERK/Beclin1 regulation pathway that plays an important part in the survival and progression of CC.

Abstract: Summary
Human retinal organoid transplantation could potentially be a treatment for degenerative retinal diseases. How the recipient retina regulates the survival, maturation, and proliferation of transplanted organoid cells is unknown. We transplanted human retinal organoid-derived cells into photoreceptor-deficient mice and conducted histology and single-cell RNA sequencing alongside time-matched cultured retinal organoids. Unexpectedly, we observed human cells that migrated into all recipient retinal layers and traveled long distances. Using an unbiased approach, we identified these cells as astrocytes and brain/spinal cord-like neural precursors that were absent or rare in stage-matched cultured organoids. In contrast, retinal progenitor-derived rods and cones remained in the subretinal space, maturing more rapidly than those in the cultured controls. These data suggest that recipient microenvironment promotes the maturation of transplanted photoreceptors while inducing or facilitating the survival of migratory cell populations that are not normally derived from retinal progenitors. These findings have important implications for potential cell-based treatments of retinal diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Cysteine chemoproteomics provides proteome-wide portraits of the ligandability or potential “druggability” for thousands of cysteine residues. Consequently, these studies are facilitating resources for closing the druggability gap, namely, achieving pharmacological manipulation of ∼96% of the human proteome that remains untargeted by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved small molecules. Recent interactive datasets have enabled users to interface more readily with cysteine chemoproteomics datasets. However, these resources remain limited to single studies and therefore do not provide a mechanism to perform cross-study analyses. Here we report CysDB as a curated community-wide repository of human cysteine chemoproteomics data derived from nine high-coverage studies. CysDB is publicly available at https://backuslab.shinyapps.io/cysdb/ and features measures of identification for 62,888 cysteines (24% of the cysteinome), as well as annotations of functionality, druggability, disease relevance, genetic variation, and structural features. Most importantly, we have designed CysDB to incorporate new datasets to further support the continued growth of the druggable cysteinome.

Abstract: With global warming, heat stress has become a primary factor that compromises the health and milk quality of dairy cows. Here, we investigated the function and underlying regulatory mechanism of miR-27a-3p in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) under heat-stress conditions. The current study showed that miR-27a-3p could prevent heat stress-induced BMEC oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage by regulating the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion processes. Importantly, we found that miR-27a-3p could increase cell proliferation under heat stress conditions by regulating the MEK/ERK pathway and cyclin D1/E1. Interestingly, miR-27a-3p is also involved in the regulation of milk protein synthesis-related protein expression, such as CSN2 and ELF5. Inhibition of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway by AZD6244 blocked the regulatory function of miR-27a-3p in cell proliferation and milk protein synthesis in BMECs under heat stress conditions. Our findings demonstrated that miR-27a-3p protects BMECs from heat stress-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage through the MEK/ERK pathway, thereby promoting BMECs proliferation and lactation in dairy co

Abstract: Summary
Retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis are inherited retinal dystrophies that can be caused by mutations in the Crumbs homolog 1 (CRB1) gene. CRB1 is required for organizing apical-basal polarity and adhesion between photoreceptors and Müller glial cells. CRB1 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into CRB1 retinal organoids that showed diminished expression of variant CRB1 protein observed by immunohistochemical analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed impact on, among others, the endosomal pathway and cell adhesion and migration in CRB1 patient-derived retinal organoids compared with isogenic controls. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated hCRB2 or hCRB1 gene augmentation in Müller glial and photoreceptor cells partially restored the histological phenotype and transcriptomic profile of CRB1 patient-derived retinal organoids. Altogether, we show proof-of-concept that AAV.hCRB1 or AAV.hCRB2 treatment improved the phenotype of CRB1 patient-derived retinal organoids, providing essential information for future gene therapy approaches for patients with mutations in the CRB1 gene.

Abstract: Although the patient's survival time in various cancers has significantly increased in recent decades, the overall 5-year survival rate of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has remained virtually unchanged due to rapid progression and metastasis. While N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) has been identified as a regulator of mRNA acetylation in many malignancies, its role in PDAC remains unclear. Here, we found that NAT10 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in PDAC tissues. Increased NAT10 protein expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis in PDAC patients. Through our experiments, we demonstrated that NAT10 acted as an oncogene to promote PDAC tumorigenesis and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NAT10 exerts its oncogenic effects by promoting mRNA stability of receptor tyrosine kinase AXL in an ac4C-dependent manner leading to increased AXL expression and further promoting PDAC cell proliferation and metastasis. Together, our findings highlight the critical of NAT10 in PDAC progression and reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism by which modified mRNA acetylation promotes PDAC metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Pathological diagnosis of gastric cancer requires pathologists to have extensive clinical experience. To help pathologists improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, we collected 1,514 cases of stomach H&E-stained specimens with complete diagnostic information to establish a pathological auxiliary diagnosis system based on deep learning. At the slide level, our system achieves a specificity of 0.8878 while maintaining a high sensitivity close to 1.0 on 269 biopsy specimens (147 malignancies) and 163 surgical specimens (80 malignancies). The classified accuracy of our system is 0.9034 at the slide level for 352 biopsy specimens (201 malignancies) from 50 medical centers. With the help of our system, the pathologists’ average false-negative rate and average false-positive rate on 100 biopsy specimens (50 malignancies) are reduced to 1/5 and 1/2 of the original rates, respectively. At the same time, the average uncertainty rate and the average diagnosis time are reduced by approximately 22% and 20%, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Filamentation is an important virulence factor of the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. The abolition of Candida albicans hyphal formation by disrupting sterol synthesis is an important concept for the development of antifungal drugs with high safety. Here, we conduct a high-throughput screen using a C. albicans strain expressing green fluorescent protein-labeled Dpp3 to identify anti-hypha agents by interfering with ergosterol synthesis. The antipyrine derivative H55 is characterized to have minimal cytotoxicity and potent inhibition of C. albicans hyphal formation in multiple cultural conditions. H55 monotherapy exhibits therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of azole-resistant candidiasis. H55 treatment increases the accumulation of zymosterol, the substrate of C-24 sterol methyltransferase (Erg6). The results of enzyme assays, photoaffinity labeling, molecular simulation, mutagenesis, and cellular thermal shift assays support H55 as an allosteric inhibitor of Erg6. Collectively, H55, an inhibitor of the fungal-specific enzyme Erg6, holds potential to treat C. albicans infections.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis(OA) is an age-related degenerative disease involving chondrocyte apoptosis and extracellular matrix(ECM) degradation.Brain acid soluble protein 1(BASP1) has been reported to induce apoptosis.Thus, we speculated that BASP1 might regulate OA progression by inducing apoptosis, which is also the purpose of this study.The cartilage of the knee joint was collected from OA patients who received the joint replacement.In OA cartilage tissue,we found BASP1 expression was highly expressed, which inferred that BASP1 might be involved in OA.To validate our hypothesis, destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery-induced male C57BL/6mice and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-treated human chondrocytes were used to mimic the OA environment.BASP1 knockdown in mice and chondrocytes was achieved by adenovirus carried with BASP1-specific shRNA.High expression of BASP1 was observed in OA mice, which was also verified in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes.The potential mechanism of BASP1 in OA was further explored in vitro.BASP1 knockdown alleviated IL-1β-induced apoptosis and ECM degradation, as reflected by the decreased number of apoptotic cells and matrix metalloproteases 13 expression,and the increased collagen II expression.Our findings indicated that BASP1 knockdown alleviated OA progression by inhibiting apoptosis and ECM degradation, suggesting that inhibiting BASP1 may be a potentially applicable method for preventing OA.

Abstract: Cell surface-bound human Hsp70 (hHsp70) sensitises tumour cells to the cytolytic attack of natural killer (NK) cells through the mediation of apoptosis-inducing serine protease, granzyme B (GrB). hHsp70 is thought to recruit NK cells to the immunological synapse via the extracellularly exposed 14 amino acid sequence, TKDNNLLGRFELSG, known as the TKD motif of Hsp70. Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (RBCs) habour both hHsp70 and an exported parasite Hsp70 termed PfHsp70-x. Both PfHsp70-x and hHsp70 share conserved TKD motifs. The role of PfHsp70-x in facilitating GrB uptake in malaria parasite-infected RBCs remains unknown, but hHsp70 enables a perforin-independent uptake of GrB into tumour cells. In the current study, we comparatively investigated the direct binding of GrB to either PfHsp70-x or hHsp70 in vitro. Using ELISA, slot blot assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, we demonstrated a direct interaction of GrB with hHsp70 and PfHsp70-x. SPR analysis revealed a higher affinity of GrB for PfHsp70-x than hHsp70. In addition, we established that the TKD motif of PfHsp70-x directly interacts with GrB. The data further suggest that the C-terminal EEVN motif of PfHsp70-x augments the affinity of PfHsp70-x for GrB but is not a prerequisite for the binding. A potent antiplasmodial activity (IC50 of 0.5 µM) of GrB could be demonstrated. These findings suggest that the uptake of GrB by parasite-infected RBCs might be mediated by both hHsp70 and PfHsp70-x. The combined activity of both proteins could account for the antiplasmodial activity of GrB at the blood stage.

Abstract: Summary
Electromyography (EMG) has been commonly used for the precise identification of animal behavior. However, it is often not recorded together with in vivo electrophysiology due to the need for additional surgeries and setups and the high risk of mechanical wire disconnection. While independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to reduce noise from field potential data, there has been no attempt to proactively use the removed “noise,” of which EMG signals are thought to be one of the major sources. Here, we demonstrate that EMG signals can be reconstructed without direct EMG recording using the “noise” ICA component from local field potentials. The extracted component is highly correlated with directly measured EMG, termed IC-EMG. IC-EMG is useful for measuring an animal’s sleep/wake, freezing response, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM)/REM sleep states consistently with actual EMG. Our method has advantages in precise and long-term behavioral measurement in wide-ranging in vivo electrophysiology experiments.

Abstract: Summary
The natural product family of the fusicoccanes (FCs) has been shown to display anti-cancer activity, especially when combined with established therapeutic agents. FCs stabilize 14-3-3 protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Here, we tested combinations of a small library of FCs with interferon α (IFNα) on different cancer cell lines and report a proteomics approach to identify the specific 14-3-3 PPIs that are induced by IFNα and stabilized by FCs in OVCAR-3 cells. Among the identified 14-3-3 target proteins are THEMIS2, receptor interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2), EIF2AK2, and several members of the LDB1 complex. Biophysical and structural biology studies confirm these 14-3-3 PPIs as physical targets of FC stabilization, and transcriptome as well as pathway analyses suggest possible explanations for the observed synergistic effect of IFNα/FC treatment on cancer cells. This study elucidates the polypharmacological effects of FCs in cancer cells and identifies potential targets from the vast interactome of 14-3-3s for therapeutic intervention in oncology.

Abstract: Summary
Commensal bacteria are critically involved in the establishment of tolerance against inflammatory challenges, the molecular mechanisms of which are just being uncovered. All kingdoms of life produce aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs). Thus far, the non-translational roles of ARSs have largely been reported in eukaryotes. Here, we report that the threonyl-tRNA synthetase (AmTARS) of the gut-associated bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila is secreted and functions to monitor and modulate immune homeostasis. Secreted AmTARS triggers M2 macrophage polarization and orchestrates the production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 via its unique, evolutionary-acquired regions, which mediates specific interactions with TLR2. This interaction activates the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, which converge on CREB, leading to an efficient production of IL-10 and suppression of the central inflammatory mediator NF-κB. AmTARS restores IL-10-positive macrophages, increases IL-10 levels in the serum, and attenuates the pathological effects in colitis mice. Thus, commensal tRNA synthetases can act as intrinsic mediators that maintain homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Undifferentiated neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) encounter extracellular signals that bind plasma membrane proteins and influence differentiation. Membrane proteins are regulated by N-linked glycosylation, making it possible that glycosylation plays a critical role in cell differentiation. We assessed enzymes that control N-glycosylation in NSPCs and found that loss of the enzyme responsible for generating β1,6-branched N-glycans, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT5), led to specific changes in NSPC differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Mgat5 homozygous null NSPCs in culture formed more neurons and fewer astrocytes compared with wild-type controls. In the brain cerebral cortex, loss of MGAT5 caused accelerated neuronal differentiation. Rapid neuronal differentiation led to depletion of cells in the NSPC niche, resulting in a shift in cortical neuron layers in Mgat5 null mice. Glycosylation enzyme MGAT5 plays a critical and previously unrecognized role in cell differentiation and early brain development.

Abstract: Summary
Image-based spatial omics methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) generate molecular profiles of single cells at single-molecule resolution. Current spatial transcriptomics methods focus on the distribution of single genes. However, the spatial proximity of RNA transcripts can play an important role in cellular function. We demonstrate a spatially resolved gene neighborhood network (spaGNN) pipeline for the analysis of subcellular gene proximity relationships. In spaGNN, machine-learning-based clustering of subcellular spatial transcriptomics data yields subcellular density classes of multiplexed transcript features. The nearest-neighbor analysis produces heterogeneous gene proximity maps in distinct subcellular regions. We illustrate the cell-type-distinguishing capability of spaGNN using multiplexed error-robust FISH data of fibroblast and U2-OS cells and sequential FISH data of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), revealing tissue-source-specific MSC transcriptomics and spatial distribution characteristics. Overall, the spaGNN approach expands the spatial features that can be used for cell-type classification tasks.

Abstract: Summary
Enzalutamide (ENZA), a second-generation androgen receptor antagonist, has significantly increased progression-free and overall survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). However, resistance remains a prominent obstacle in treatment. Utilizing a kinome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, we identified casein kinase 1α (CK1α) as a therapeutic target to overcome ENZA resistance. Depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of CK1α enhanced ENZA efficacy in ENZA-resistant cells and patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, CK1α phosphorylates the serine residue S1270 and modulates the protein abundance of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a primary initiator of DNA double-strand break (DSB)-response signaling, which is compromised in ENZA-resistant cells and patients. Inhibition of CK1α stabilizes ATM, resulting in the restoration of DSB signaling, and thus increases ENZA-induced cell death and growth arrest. Our study details a therapeutic approach for ENZA-resistant PCa and characterizes a particular perspective for the function of CK1α in the regulation of DNA-damage response.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanisms allowing hair follicles to periodically activate their stem cells (HFSCs) are incompletely characterized. Here, we identify the transcription factor IRX5 as a promoter of HFSC activation. Irx5−/− mice have delayed anagen onset, with increased DNA damage and diminished HFSC proliferation. Open chromatin regions form near cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair genes in Irx5−/− HFSCs. DNA damage repair factor BRCA1 is an IRX5 downstream target. Inhibition of FGF kinase signaling partially rescues the anagen delay in Irx5−/− mice, suggesting that the Irx5−/− HFSC quiescent phenotype is partly due to failure to suppress Fgf18 expression. Interfollicular epidermal stem cells also show decreased proliferation and increased DNA damage in Irx5−/−mice. Consistent with a role for IRX5 as a promoter of DNA damage repair, we find that IRX genes are upregulated in many cancer types and that there is a correlation between IRX5 and BRCA1 expression in breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Alterations in the microbiome correlate with improved metabolism in patients following bariatric surgery. While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from obese patients into germ-free (GF) mice has suggested a significant role of the gut microbiome in metabolic improvements following bariatric surgery, causality remains to be confirmed. Here, we perform paired FMT from the same obese patients (BMI > 40; four patients), pre- and 1 or 6 months post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, into Western diet-fed GF mice. Mice colonized by FMT from patients’ post-surgery stool exhibit significant changes in microbiota composition and metabolomic profiles and, most importantly, improved insulin sensitivity compared with pre-RYGB FMT mice. Mechanistically, mice harboring the post-RYGB microbiome show increased brown fat mass and activity and exhibit increased energy expenditure. Moreover, improvements in immune homeostasis within the white adipose tissue are also observed. Altogether, these findings point to a direct role for the gut microbiome in mediating improved metabolic health post-RYGB surgery.

Abstract: Tumor cells can promote angiogenesis by secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs). Meanwhile, tumor-derived EVs can carry long non-coding RNAs to activate pro-angiogenic signaling in endothelial cells. Here, we investigated the role of long non-coding RNA MCM3AP-AS1 carried by cervical cancer (CC) cell-derived EVs in the angiogenesis and the resultant tumor growth in CC, as well as the potential molecular mechanisms. LncRNAs significantly expressed in CC cell-derived EVs and CC were screened, followed by prediction of downstream target genes. EVs were isolated from HcerEpic and CaSki cell supernatants, followed by identification. The expression of MCM3AP-AS1 in CC was analyzed and its interaction with miR-93-p21 was confirmed. Following co-culture system, the role of MCM3AP-AS1 carried by EVs in HUVEC angiogenic ability, CC cell invasion and migration in vitro along with angiogenesis and tumorigenicity in vivo was assayed. MCM3AP-AS1 was overexpressed in CC cell-derived EVs as well as in CC tissues and cell lines. Cervical cancer cell-derived EVs could transfer MCM3AP-AS1 into HUVECs where MCM3AP-AS1 competitively bound to miR-93 and upregulate the expression of the miR-93 target p21 gene. Thus, MCM3AP-AS1 promoted angiogenesis of HUVECs. In the similar manner, MCM3AP-AS1 enhanced CC cell malignant properties. In nude mice, EVs-MCM3AP-AS1 induced angiogenesis and tumor growth. Overall, this study reveals that CC cell-derived EVs may transport MCM3AP-AS1 to promote angiogenesis and tumor growth in CC.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic wounds frequently become infected with bacterial biofilms which respond poorly to antibiotic therapy. Aminoglycoside antibiotics are ineffective at treating deep-seated wound infections due to poor drug penetration, poor drug uptake into persister cells, and widespread antibiotic resistance. In this study, we combat the two major barriers to successful aminoglycoside treatment against a biofilm-infected wound: limited antibiotic uptake and limited biofilm penetration. To combat the limited antibiotic uptake, we employ palmitoleic acid, a host-produced monounsaturated fatty acid that perturbs the membrane of gram-positive pathogens and induces gentamicin uptake. This novel drug combination overcomes gentamicin tolerance and resistance in multiple gram-positive wound pathogens. To combat biofilm penetration, we examined the ability of sonobactericide, a non-invasive ultrasound-mediated-drug delivery technology to improve antibiotic efficacy using an in vivo biofilm model. This dual approach dramatically improved antibiotic efficacy against a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) wound infection in diabetic mice.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting germline (gl-) precursors of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) is acknowledged as an important strategy for HIV-1 vaccines. The VRC01-class of bNAbs is attractive because of its distinct genetic signature. However, VRC01-class bNAbs often require extensive somatic hypermutation, including rare insertions and deletions. We describe a BG505 SOSIP trimer, termed GT1.2, to optimize binding to gl-CH31, the unmutated common precursor of the CH30-34 bNAb lineage that acquired a large CDRH1 insertion. The GT1.2 trimer activates gl-CH31 naive B cells in knock-in mice, and B cell responses could be matured by selected boosting immunogens to generate cross-reactive Ab responses. Next-generation B cell sequencing reveals selection for VRC01-class mutations, including insertions in CDRH1 and FWR3 at positions identical to VRC01-class bNAbs, as well as CDRL1 deletions and/or glycine substitutions to accommodate the N276 glycan. These results provide proof of concept for vaccine-induced affinity maturation of B cell lineages that require rare insertions and deletions.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSP) are molecular chaperones involved in many normal cellular processes and environmental stresses. At the genome-wide level, there were no reports on the diversity and phylogeny of the heat shock protein family in Procecidochares utilis. In this study, 43 HSPs were identified from the genome of P. utilis, including 12 small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), 23 heat shock protein 40 (DNAJs), 6 heat shock protein 70 (HSP70s), and 2 heat shock protein 90 (HSP90s). The characteristics of these candidates HSP genes were analyzed by BLAST, and then phylogenetic analysis was carried out. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the spatiotemporal expression patterns of sHSPs and HSP70s in P. utilis after temperature stress. Results showed that most sHSPs could be induced under heat stress during the adult stage of P. utilis, while a few HSP70s could be induced at the larval stage. This study provides an information framework for the HSP family of P. utilis. Moreover, it lays an important foundation for a better understanding of the role of HSP in the adaptability of P. utilis to various environments.

Here, we present a gut phage isolate collection (GPIC) containing 209 phages for 42 commensal human gut bacterial species. Genome analysis of the phages identified 34 undescribed genera. We discovered 22 phages from the Salasmaviridae family that have small genomes (∼10–20 kbp) and infect Gram-positive bacteria. Two phages from a candidate family, Paboviridae, with high prevalence in the human gut were also identified. Infection assays showed that Bacteroides and Parabacteroides phages are specific to a bacterial species, and strains of the same species also exhibit substantial variations in phage susceptibility. A cocktail of 8 phages with a broad host range for Bacteroides fragilis strains effectively reduced their abundance in complex host-derived communities in vitro. Our study expands the diversity of cultured human gut bacterial phages and provides a valuable resource for human microbiome engineering.

Abstract: Background
Fibrotic scar is a severe side effect of trabeculectomy, resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes for glaucoma surgery. Accumulating evidence showed human Tenon's fibroblasts (HTFs) play an important role in fibrosis formation. We previously reported that the aqueous level of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) was higher in the patients with primary angle closure glaucoma, which was associated with the failure of trabeculectomy. In this study, the potential effect and mechanism of SPARC in promoting fibrosis were explored by using HTFs.
Methods
HTFs were employed in this study and examined under a phase-contrast microscope. Cell viability was determined by CCK-8. The expressions of SPARC-YAP/TAZ signaling and the fibrosis-related markers were examined with reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blot, and immunofluorescence, subcellular fractionation was conducted to further determined the variation of YAP and phosphorylated YAP. The differential gene expressions were analyzed with RNA sequencing (RNAseq), followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses.
Results
Exogenous SPARC induced HTFs-myofibroblast transformation, as evidenced by the increased expression of α-SMA, collagen I and fibronectin in both protein and mRNA levels. SPARC knockdown decreased the expressions of the above genes in TGF-β2-treated HTFs. KEGG analysis showed that the Hippo signaling pathway was mostly enriched. SPARC treatment increased the expressions of YAP, TAZ, CTGF and CYR61 as well as enhanced YAP translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus, and decreased the phosphorylation of YAP and LAST1/2, which was reversed by SPARC knockdown. Knockdown of YAP1 decreased the fibrosis-related markers, such as α-SMA, collagen I and Fibronectin, in SPARC-treated HTFs.
Conclusions
SPARC induced HTFs-myofibroblast transformation via activating YAP/TAZ signaling. Targeting SPARC-YAP/TAZ axis in HTFs might provide a novel strategy for inhibiting fibrosis formation after trabeculectomy.

Abstract: Summary
Artemisinins (ART) are critical anti-malarials and despite their use in combination therapy, ART-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is spreading globally. To counter ART resistance, we designed artezomibs (ATZs), molecules that link an ART with a proteasome inhibitor (PI) via a non-labile amide bond and hijack parasite’s own ubiquitin-proteasome system to create novel anti-malarials in situ. Upon activation of the ART moiety, ATZs covalently attach to and damage multiple parasite proteins, marking them for proteasomal degradation. When damaged proteins enter the proteasome, their attached PIs inhibit protease function, potentiating the parasiticidal action of ART and overcoming ART resistance. Binding of the PI moiety to the proteasome active site is enhanced by distal interactions of the extended attached peptides, providing a mechanism to overcome PI resistance. ATZs have an extra mode of action beyond that of each component, thereby overcoming resistance to both components, while avoiding transient monotherapy seen when individual agents have disparate pharmacokinetic profiles.

Abstract: Summary
The transgenerational maternal effects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in female progeny are being revealed. As there is evidence that a male equivalent of PCOS may exists, we ask whether sons born to mothers with PCOS (PCOS-sons) transmit reproductive and metabolic phenotypes to their male progeny. Here, in a register-based cohort and a clinical case-control study, we find that PCOS-sons are more often obese and dyslipidemic. Our prenatal androgenized PCOS-like mouse model with or without diet-induced obesity confirmed that reproductive and metabolic dysfunctions in first-generation (F1) male offspring are passed down to F3. Sequencing of F1–F3 sperm reveals distinct differentially expressed (DE) small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) across generations in each lineage. Notably, common targets between transgenerational DEsncRNAs in mouse sperm and in PCOS-sons serum indicate similar effects of maternal hyperandrogenism, strengthening the translational relevance and highlighting a previously underappreciated risk of transmission of reproductive and metabolic dysfunction via the male germline.

Oleic acid improves hepatic lipotoxicity injury by alleviating autophagy dysfunction,

Abstract: Lipotoxicity caused by excess free fatty acids, particularly saturated fatty acids (SFAs) such as palmitic acid (PA), is one of the most important pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), such as oleic acid (OA), are nontoxic and can combat SFA-induced toxicity through alleviation of cell apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and lipids metabolism disorder. However, whether OA is able to regulate autophagy is largely unknown. So, this study aims to investigate the mechanism underlying OA mediated modulation of autophagy in hepatocytes and mice with NAFLD. In vitro, human hepatoma cell line HepG2 cells, human normal liver cells L-02 and mouse normal liver cells AML12 were treated with palmitic acid (PA)/tunicamycin (TM) or/and OA for 48 h. In vivo, C57/BL6 mice were fed with high fat diet (HFD) to induce NAFLD. And the HFD was partial replaced by olive oil to observe the protective effects of olive oil. We demonstrated that PA/TM impaired cell viability and induced cellular apoptosis in HepG2 cells and L-02 cells. Moreover, PA/TM induced autophagy impairment by reducing the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and inhibiting the activity of CTSB. However, OA substantially alleviated PA/TM induced cellular apoptosis and autophagy dysfunction in hepatocytes. Additionally, restoring autophagy function is able to reduce ER stress. Similarly, HFD for 20 weeks successfully established NAFLD model in C57/BL6 mice, and significant autophagy impairment were observed in liver tissues. Noteworthily, 30% replacement of HFD with olive oil had profoundly reversed NAFLD. It significantly impoved steatosis, and reduced autophagy dysfunction, ER stress and apoptosis in liver tissue. Conclusively, these data demonstrated that OA is able to effectively impove autophagy dysfunction under the context of both PA and ER stress inducer induced lipotoxicity, and OA mediated regulation of lysosome dysfunction through TFEB plays an important role, suggesting that the regulation of ER stress-autophagy axis is a critical mechanism in OA driven protection in NAFLD.

Abstract: This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs) by regulating ferroptosis. H/R model was established with HCMECs and before the reperfusion, ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 or ferroptosis inducer erastin was all administered. Wound-healing assay was performed to detect the migration ability of cells in each group, and the angiogenesis ability was determined by tube formation assay. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by flow cytometry. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the state of mitochondria. The expressions of related proteins in HCMECs were assessed by Western blot. From the results, H/R injury could inhibit the migration and angiogenesis, induce the ROS production, and cause the mitochondrial damage of HCMECs. Ferroptosis activator erastin could aggravate H/R injury in HCMECs, while the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 could reverse the effects of H/R on HCMECs. Western blot results showed that H/R or/and erastin treatment could significantly induce ACSL4, HGF, VEGF, p-ERK, and uPA protein expression and inhibit GPX4 expression. The addition of ferrostatin-1 resulted in the opposite trend of the proteins expression above to erastin treatment. What is more, overexpression of ENPP2 markedly suppressed the damaging effect of H/R on HCMECs and reversed the effects of H/R or erastin treatment on the expression of related proteins. These results demonstrated a great therapeutic efficacy of ENPP2 overexpression in preventing the development of H/R injury through inhibiting oxidative stress and ferroptosis.

Abstract: Summary
White blister rust, caused by the oomycete Albugo candida, is a widespread disease of Brassica crops. The Brassica relative Arabidopsis thaliana uses the paired immune receptor complex CSA1-CHS3/DAR4 to resist Albugo infection. The CHS3/DAR4 sensor NLR, which functions together with its partner, the helper NLR CSA1, carries an integrated domain (ID) with homology to DA1 peptidases. Using domain swaps with several DA1 homologs, we show that the LIM-peptidase domain of the family member CHS3/DAR4 functions as an integrated decoy for the family member DAR3, which interacts with and inhibits the peptidase activities of the three closely related peptidases DA1, DAR1, and DAR2. Albugo infection rapidly lowers DAR3 levels and activates DA1 peptidase activity, thereby promoting endoreduplication of host tissues to support pathogen growth. We propose that the paired immune receptor CSA1-CHS3/DAR4 detects the actions of a putative Albugo effector that reduces DAR3 levels, resulting in defense activation.

Abstract: Summary
Triadin knockout syndrome (TKOS) is a malignant arrhythmia disorder caused by recessive null variants in TRDN-encoded cardiac triadin. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) were generated from two unrelated TKOS patients and an unrelated control. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing was used to insert homozygous TRDN-p.D18fs∗13 into a control line to generate a TKOS model (TRDN−/−). Western blot confirmed total knockout of triadin in patient-specific and TRDN−/− iPSC-CMs. iPSC-CMs from both patients revealed a prolonged action potential duration (APD) at 90% repolarization, and this was normalized by protein replacement of triadin. APD prolongation was confirmed in TRDN−/− iPSC-CMs. TRDN−/− iPSC-CMs revealed that loss of triadin underlies decreased expression and co-localization of key calcium handling proteins, slow and decreased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and slow inactivation of the L-type calcium channel leading to frequent cellular arrhythmias, including early and delayed afterdepolarizations and APD alternans.

Abstract: Summary
Tracking the emergence and spread of pathogen variants is an important component of monitoring infectious disease outbreaks. To that end, accurately estimating the number and prevalence of pathogen variants in a population requires carefully designed surveillance programs. However, current approaches to calculating the number of pathogen samples needed for effective surveillance often do not account for the various processes that can bias which infections are detected and which samples are ultimately characterized as a specific variant. In this article, we introduce a framework that accounts for the logistical and epidemiological processes that may bias variant characterization, and we demonstrate how to use this framework (implemented in a publicly available tool) to calculate the number of sequences needed for surveillance. Our framework is designed to be easy to use while also flexible enough to be adapted to various pathogens and surveillance scenarios.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we present FusionInspector for in silico characterization and interpretation of candidate fusion transcripts from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and exploration of their sequence and expression characteristics. We applied FusionInspector to thousands of tumor and normal transcriptomes and identified statistical and experimental features enriched among biologically impactful fusions. Through clustering and machine learning, we identified large collections of fusions potentially relevant to tumor and normal biological processes. We show that biologically relevant fusions are enriched for relatively high expression of the fusion transcript, imbalanced fusion allelic ratios, and canonical splicing patterns, and are deficient in sequence microhomologies between partner genes. We demonstrate that FusionInspector accurately validates fusion transcripts in silico and helps characterize numerous understudied fusions in tumor and normal tissue samples. FusionInspector is freely available as open source for screening, characterization, and visualization of candidate fusions via RNA-seq, and facilitates transparent explanation and interpretation of machine-learning predictions and their experimental sources.

Abstract: Summary
IsomiRs, sequence variants of mature microRNAs, are usually detected and quantified using high-throughput sequencing. Many examples of their biological relevance have been reported, but sequencing artifacts identified as artificial variants might bias biological inference and therefore need to be ideally avoided. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 10 different small RNA sequencing protocols, exploring both a theoretically isomiR-free pool of synthetic miRNAs and HEK293T cells. We calculated that, with the exception of two protocols, less than 5% of miRNA reads can be attributed to library preparation artifacts. Randomized-end adapter protocols showed superior accuracy, with 40% of true biological isomiRs. Nevertheless, we demonstrate concordance across protocols for selected miRNAs in non-templated uridyl additions. Notably, NTA-U calling and isomiR target prediction can be inaccurate when using protocols with poor single-nucleotide resolution. Our results highlight the relevance of protocol choice for biological isomiRs detection and annotation, which has key potential implications for biomedical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a leading cause of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The impact of the gut microbiota and associated metabolites on APAP and liver function remains unclear. We show that APAP disturbance is associated with a distinct gut microbial community, with notable decreases in Lactobacillus vaginalis. Mice receiving L. vaginalis showed resistance to APAP hepatotoxicity due to the liberation of the isoflavone daidzein from the diet by bacterial β-galactosidase. The hepatoprotective effects of L. vaginalis in APAP-exposed germ-free mice were abolished with a β-galactosidase inhibitor. Similarly, β-galactosidase-deficient L. vaginalis produced poorer outcomes in APAP-treated mice than the wild-type strain, but these differences were overcome with daidzein administration. Mechanistically, daidzein prevented ferroptotic death, which was linked to decreased expression of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (Fdps) that activated a key ferroptosis pathway involving AKT-GSK3β-Nrf2. Thus, liberation of daidzein by L. vaginalis β-galactosidase inhibits Fdps-mediated hepatocyte ferroptosis, providing promising therapeutic approaches for DILI.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a renewable cell source that can be differentiated into neural progenitor cells (iNPCs) and transduced with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (iNPC-GDNFs). The goal of the current study is to characterize iNPC-GDNFs and test their therapeutic potential and safety. Single-nuclei RNA-seq show iNPC-GDNFs express NPC markers. iNPC-GDNFs delivered into the subretinal space of the Royal College of Surgeons rodent model of retinal degeneration preserve photoreceptors and visual function. Additionally, iNPC-GDNF transplants in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) rats preserve motor neurons. Finally, iNPC-GDNF transplants in the spinal cord of athymic nude rats survive and produce GDNF for 9 months, with no signs of tumor formation or continual cell proliferation. iNPC-GDNFs survive long-term, are safe, and provide neuroprotection in models of both retinal degeneration and ALS, indicating their potential as a combined cell and gene therapy for various neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is the prevailing cause of chronic liver disease, which progresses to Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 75% of cases. It represents a serious health concern being the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Treatments available to date fail to provide a complete cure with high chances of recurrence and related side effects. The lack of reliable, reproducible, and scalable in vitro modeling systems that could recapitulate the viral life cycle and represent virus-host interactions has hindered the development of effective treatments so far. The present review provides insights into the current in-vivo and in-vitro models used for studying HBV and their major limitations. We highlight the use of three-dimensional liver organoids as a novel and suitable platform for modeling HBV infection and HBV-mediated HCC. HBV organoids can be expanded, genetically altered, patient-derived, tested for drug discovery, and biobanked. This review also provides the general guidelines for culturing HBV organoids and highlights their several prospects for HBV drug discovery and screening.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis is a regulated form of cell death associated with the iron-dependent accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides. Inducing ferroptosis is a promising approach to treat therapy-resistant cancer. Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) promotes ferroptosis resistance in cancer by generating the antioxidant form of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ). Despite the important role of FSP1, few molecular tools exist that target the CoQ-FSP1 pathway. Through a series of chemical screens, we identify several structurally diverse FSP1 inhibitors. The most potent of these compounds, ferroptosis sensitizer 1 (FSEN1), is an uncompetitive inhibitor that acts selectively through on-target inhibition of FSP1 to sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis. Furthermore, a synthetic lethality screen reveals that FSEN1 synergizes with endoperoxide-containing ferroptosis inducers, including dihydroartemisinin, to trigger ferroptosis. These results provide new tools that catalyze the exploration of FSP1 as a therapeutic target and highlight the value of combinatorial therapeutic regimes targeting FSP1 and additional ferroptosis defense pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade therapy with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is a treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, some patients remain unresponsive to PD-1 blockade. The gut microbiota has been linked to immunotherapy resistance through unclear mechanisms. We found that patients with metastatic CRC who fail to respond to immunotherapy had a greater abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum and increased succinic acid. Fecal microbiota transfer from responders with low F. nucleatum, but not F. nucleatum-high non-responders, conferred sensitivity to anti-PD-1 mAb in mice. Mechanistically, F. nucleatum-derived succinic acid suppressed the cGAS-interferon-β pathway, consequently dampening the antitumor response by limiting CD8+ T cell trafficking to the tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo. Treatment with the antibiotic metronidazole reduced intestinal F. nucleatum abundance, thereby decreasing serum succinic acid levels and resensitizing tumors to immunotherapy in vivo. These findings indicate that F. nucleatum and succinic acid induce tumor resistance to immunotherapy, offering insights into microbiota-metabolite-immune crosstalk in CRC.

Abstract: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction is a powerful tool for quantifying gene expression. The relative quantification relies on normalizing the data to reference genes or internal controls not modulated by the experimental conditions. The most widely used internal controls occasionally show changed expression patterns in different experimental settings, such as the mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Thus, identifying appropriate internal controls is of utmost importance. We analyzed multiple RNA-Seq datasets using a combination of statistical approaches such as percent relative range and coefficient of variance to define a list of candidate internal control genes, which was then validated experimentally and by using in silico analyses as well. We identified a group of genes as strong internal control candidates with high stability compared to the classical ones. We also presented evidence for the superiority of the percent relative range method for calculating expression stability in data sets with larger sample sizes. We used multiple methods to analyze data collected from several RNA-Seq datasets; we identified Rbm17 and Katna1 as the most stable reference genes in EMT/MET studies. The percent relative range approach surpasses other methods when analyzing datasets of larger sample sizes.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue clearing renders entire organs transparent to accelerate whole-tissue imaging; for example, with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. Yet, challenges remain in analyzing the large resulting 3D datasets that consist of terabytes of images and information on millions of labeled cells. Previous work has established pipelines for automated analysis of tissue-cleared mouse brains, but the focus there was on single-color channels and/or detection of nuclear localized signals in relatively low-resolution images. Here, we present an automated workflow (COMBINe, Cell detectiOn in Mouse BraIN) to map sparsely labeled neurons and astrocytes in genetically distinct mouse forebrains using mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM). COMBINe blends modules from multiple pipelines with RetinaNet at its core. We quantitatively analyzed the regional and subregional effects of MADM-based deletion of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on neuronal and astrocyte populations in the mouse forebrain.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding antibody-antigen interactions in a polyclonal immune response in humans and animal models is critical for rational vaccine design. Current approaches typically characterize antibodies that are functionally relevant or highly abundant. Here, we use photo-cross-linking and single-particle electron microscopy to increase antibody detection and unveil epitopes of low-affinity and low-abundance antibodies, leading to a broader structural characterization of polyclonal immune responses. We employed this approach across three different viral glycoproteins and showed increased sensitivity of detection relative to currently used methods. Results were most noticeable in early and late time points of a polyclonal immune response. Additionally, the use of photo-cross-linking revealed intermediate antibody binding states and demonstrated a distinctive way to study antibody binding mechanisms. This technique can be used to structurally characterize the landscape of a polyclonal immune response of patients in vaccination or post-infection studies at early time points, allowing for rapid iterative design of vaccine immunogens.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the main causes of liver disease that has reached its last stage. Over the past few years, evidence for miRNAs' centrality in NAFLD pathogenesis has accumulated. According to some studies, miR-574–5p plays a role in lipid metabolism. However, research on the relationship between miR-574–5p and NAFLD is lacking. For in vivo experiments, we induced the NAFLD mice model with a high-fat diet (HFD). AgomiR-574–5p was injected intravenously into HFD-fed mice for eight weeks, and qPCR was used to identify the expression of miR-574–5p in the serum. In in vitro experiments, The treatment of L-O2 cells with a miR-574–5p mimic resulted in a significant reduction in lipid deposition, suggesting that miR-574–5p can inhibit lipid accumulation and lipid formation induced by OA. The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that miR-574–5p targets the 3′ UTR region of HOXC6 directly. We discovered that OA-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes might be mediated through the miR-574-5p-HOXC6 signaling axis. Additional research is required in order to determine the specific mechanism by which HOXC6 downstream pathways are involved in the miR-574–5p induced lipid uptake.

Abstract: Summary
The spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) niche is critical for SSC maintenance and subsequent spermatogenesis. Numerous reproductive hazards impair the SSC niche, thereby resulting in aberrant SSC self-renewal and male infertility. However, promising agents targeting the impaired SSC niche to promote SSC self-renewal are still limited. Here, we screen out and assess the effects of Lovastatin on the self-renewal of mouse SSCs (mSSCs). Mechanistically, Lovastatin promotes the self-renewal of mSSCs and inhibits its inflammation and apoptosis through the regulation of isoprenoid intermediates. Remarkably, treatment by Lovastatin could promote the proliferation of undifferentiated spermatogonia in the male gonadotoxicity model generated by busulfan injection. Of note, we demonstrate that Lovastatin could enhance the proliferation of primate undifferentiated spermatogonia. Collectively, our findings uncover that lovastatin could promote the self-renewal of both murine and primate SSCs and have implications for the treatment of certain types of male infertility using small compounds.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell transcriptomics can provide quantitative molecular signatures for large, unbiased samples of the diverse cell types in the brain. With the advances of multi-omics datasets, a major challenge is to validate and integrate results into a biological understanding of spatial organization and functional orientation. Here, we generate spatial transcriptomes and metabolites from six patients with brain trauma with surgical samples. The resulting spatial marker gene, which is highly replicable across analysis methods, sequencing technologies, and modalities, is a comprehensive molecular marker of the diverse metabolic changes in human injured brains. The atlas includes an area of lipid peroxidation that resembles injured neurons in the brain. We further discover imbalanced myo-inositol and myo-inositol phosphate and related spatial markers. Our results highlight the complex transcriptomic regulation and metabolic alterations in the injured brain and will directly enable the design of reagents to target specific genes in the human brain for functional analysis.

Abstract: Summary
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based immunopeptidomics is an attractive antigen discovery method with growing clinical implications. However, the current experimental approach to extract HLA-restricted peptides requires a bulky sample source, which remains a challenge for obtaining clinical specimens. We present an innovative workflow that requires a low sample volume, which streamlines the immunoaffinity purification (IP) and C18 peptide cleanup on a single microfluidics platform with automated liquid handling and minimal sample transfers, resulting in higher assay sensitivity. We also demonstrate how the state-of-the-art data-independent acquisition (DIA) method further enhances the depth of tandem MS spectra-based peptide sequencing. Consequently, over 4,000 and 5,000 HLA-I-restricted peptides were identified from as few as 0.2 million RA957 cells and a melanoma tissue of merely 5 mg, respectively. We also identified multiple immunogenic tumor-associated antigens and hundreds of peptides derived from non-canonical protein sources. This workflow represents a powerful tool for identifying the immunopeptidome of sparse samples.

Abstract: Summary
Uric acid, the end product of purine degradation, causes hyperuricemia and gout, afflicting hundreds of millions of people. The debilitating effects of gout are exacerbated by dietary purine intake, and thus a potential therapeutic strategy is to enhance purine degradation in the gut microbiome. Aerobic purine degradation involves oxidative dearomatization of uric acid catalyzed by the O2-dependent uricase. The enzymes involved in purine degradation in strictly anaerobic bacteria remain unknown. Here we report the identification and characterization of these enzymes, which include four hydrolases belonging to different enzyme families, and a prenyl-flavin mononucleotide-dependent decarboxylase. Introduction of the first two hydrolases to Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 enabled its anaerobic growth on xanthine as the sole nitrogen source. Oral supplementation of these engineered probiotics ameliorated hyperuricemia in a Drosophila melanogaster model, including the formation of renal uric acid stones and a shortened lifespan, providing a route toward the development of purinolytic probiotics.

Abstract: Summary
Although lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing and commensurate human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximodistal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. These lung buds are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. Transcriptomic comparisons of infected lung buds and postmortem tissue of COVID-19 patients identified an induction of BMP signaling pathway. BMP activity renders lung cells more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its pharmacological inhibition impairs infection by this virus. These data highlight the rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue using lung buds that recapitulate key features of human lung morphogenesis and viral infection biology.

Abstract: Summary
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that has been associated with the gut microbiota. However, whether and how the gut microbiota plays a pathogenic role in RA remains unexplored. Here, we observed that Fusobacterium nucleatum is enriched in RA patients and positively associated with RA severity. F. nucleatum similarly aggravates arthritis in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). F. nucleatum outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) containing the virulence determinant FadA translocate into the joints, triggering local inflammatory responses. Specifically, FadA acts on synovial macrophages, resulting in the activation of the Rab5a GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking and inflammatory pathways and YB-1, a key regulator of inflammatory mediators. OMVs containing FadA and heightened Rab5a-YB-1 expression were observed in RA patients compared with controls. These findings suggest a causal role of F. nucleatum in aggravating RA and provide promising therapeutic targets for clinically ameliorating RA.

Abstract: Summary
To develop therapies for Alzheimer’s disease, we need accurate in vivo diagnostics. Multiple proteomic studies mapping biomarker candidates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resulted in little overlap. To overcome this shortcoming, we apply the rarely used concept of proteomics meta-analysis to identify an effective biomarker panel. We combine ten independent datasets for biomarker identification: seven datasets from 150 patients/controls for discovery, one dataset with 20 patients/controls for down-selection, and two datasets with 494 patients/controls for validation. The discovery results in 21 biomarker candidates and down-selection in three, to be validated in the two additional large-scale proteomics datasets with 228 diseased and 266 control samples. This resulting 3-protein biomarker panel differentiates Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from controls in the two validation cohorts with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) of 0.83 and 0.87, respectively. This study highlights the value of systematically re-analyzing previously published proteomics data and the need for more stringent data deposition.

Abstract: Summary
Visual processing in the retina depends on the collective activity of large ensembles of neurons organized in different layers. Current techniques for measuring activity of layer-specific neural ensembles rely on expensive pulsed infrared lasers to drive 2-photon activation of calcium-dependent fluorescent reporters. We present a 1-photon light-sheet imaging system that can measure the activity in hundreds of neurons in the ex vivo retina over a large field of view while presenting visual stimuli. This allows for a reliable functional classification of different retinal cell types. We also demonstrate that the system has sufficient resolution to image calcium entry at individual synaptic release sites across the axon terminals of dozens of simultaneously imaged bipolar cells. The simple design, large field of view, and fast image acquisition make this a powerful system for high-throughput and high-resolution measurements of retinal processing at a fraction of the cost of alternative approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors that originate from mesenchymal cells. p53 is frequently mutated in human STS. In this study, we found that the loss of p53 in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) mainly causes adult undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma (USTS). MSCs lacking p53 show changes in stem cell properties, including differentiation, cell cycle progression, and metabolism. The transcriptomic changes and genetic mutations in murine p53-deficient USTS mimic those seen in human STS. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that MSCs undergo transcriptomic alterations with aging—a risk factor for certain types of USTS—and that p53 signaling decreases simultaneously. Moreover, we found that human STS can be transcriptomically classified into six clusters with different prognoses, different from the current histopathological classification. This study paves the way for understanding MSC-mediated tumorigenesis and provides an efficient mouse model for sarcoma studies.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the successes of current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, waning immunity, the emergence of variants of concern, and breakthrough infections among vaccinees have begun to highlight opportunities to improve vaccine platforms. Real-world vaccine efficacy studies have highlighted the reduced risk of breakthrough infections and diseases among individuals infected and vaccinated, referred to as hybrid immunity. Thus, we sought to define whether hybrid immunity shapes the humoral immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) following Pfizer/BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, ChadOx1/AZD1222, and Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. Each vaccine exhibits a unique functional humoral profile in vaccination only or hybrid immunity. However, hybrid immunity shows a unique augmentation of S2-domain-specific functional immunity that was poorly induced for the vaccination only. These data highlight the importance of natural infection in breaking the immunodominance away from the evolutionarily unstable S1 domain and potentially affording enhanced cross-variant protection by targeting the more highly conserved S2 domain of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Summary
Rationally designed and engineered bacteria represent an emerging unique approach for cancer treatment. Here, we engineer a short-lived bacterium, mp105, that is effective against diverse cancer types and safe for intravenous administration. We reveal that mp105 combats cancer by direct oncolysis, depletion of tumor-associated macrophages, and elicitation of CD4+ T cell immunity. We further engineer a glucose-sensing bacterium named m6001 that selectively colonizes solid tumors. When intratumorally injected, m6001 clears tumors more efficiently than mp105 due to its post-delivery replication in tumors and potent oncolytic capacity. Finally, we combine intravenous injection of mp105 and intratumoral injection of m6001, forming a double team against cancer. The double team enhances cancer therapy compared with single treatment for subjects carrying both intratumorally injectable and uninjectable tumors. The two anticancer bacteria and their combination are applicable to different scenarios, turning bacterial therapy for cancer into a feasible solution.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic and in vivo evidence suggests that aberrant recognition of RNA-containing autoantigens by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8 drives autoimmune diseases. Here we report on the preclinical characterization of MHV370, a selective oral TLR7/8 inhibitor. In vitro, MHV370 inhibits TLR7/8-dependent production of cytokines in human and mouse cells, notably interferon-α, a clinically validated driver of autoimmune diseases. Moreover, MHV370 abrogates B cell, plasmacytoid dendritic cell, monocyte, and neutrophil responses downstream of TLR7/8. In vivo, prophylactic or therapeutic administration of MHV370 blocks secretion of TLR7 responses, including cytokine secretion, B cell activation, and gene expression of, e.g., interferon-stimulated genes. In the NZB/W F1 mouse model of lupus, MHV370 halts disease. Unlike hydroxychloroquine, MHV370 potently blocks interferon responses triggered by specific immune complexes from systemic lupus erythematosus patient sera, suggesting differentiation from clinical standard of care. These data support advancement of MHV370 to an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial.

Abstract: Objectives
Metabolic reprogramming is not only an essential hallmark in the progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but also an important regulator of cancer cell adaptation to tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the potential mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in TME of HNSCC is still unknown.
Methods
The head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with survival information were obtained the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The metabolic‐related genes were identified by differential analysis and survival analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to determine an overall estimate of metabolic-related risk signature and related clinical parameters. The sensitivity and specificity of the risk signature were evaluated by time-dependent receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves. TME immune cell infiltration mediated by metabolic‐related genes was explored by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and correlation analysis.
Results
Seven metabolic-related genes (SMS, MTHFD2, HPRT1, DNMT1, PYGL, ADA, and P4HA1) were identified to develop a metabolic-related risk signature. The low-risk group had a better overall survival compared to that of the high-risk group in the TCGA and GSE65858 cohorts. The AUCs for 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival were 0.646 vs. 0.673, 0.694 vs. 0.639, and 0.673 vs. 0.573, respectively. The AUC vale of risk score was 0.727 vs. 0.673. The low-risk group was associated with immune cell infiltration in the TME.
Conclusions
The metabolic-related risk signature were constructed and validated, which could involve in regulating the immune cell infiltration in the TME and act as an independent biomarker that predicted the prognosis of HNSCC.

Abstract: The close apposition between two different organelles is critical in essential processes such as ion homeostasis, signaling, and lipid transition. However, information related to the structural features of membrane contact sites (MCSs) is limited. This study used immuno-electron microscopy and immuno-electron tomography (I-ET) to analyze the two- and three-dimensional structures of the late endosome–mitochondria contact sites in placental cells. Filamentous structures or tethers were identified that connected the late endosomes and mitochondria. Lamp1 antibody-labeled I-ET revealed enrichment of tethers in the MCSs. The cholesterol-binding endosomal protein metastatic lymph node 64 (MLN64) encoded by STARD3 was required for the formation of this apposition. The distance of the late endosome–mitochondria contact sites was <20 nm, shorter than that in STARD3-knockdown cells (<150 nm). The perturbation of cholesterol egress from the endosomes induced by U18666A treatment produced a longer distance in the contact sites than that in knockdown cells. The late endosome–mitochondria tethers failed to form correctly in STARD3-knockdown cells.

Abstract: Damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin (CRT) exposure, high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) elevation, and ATP release, characterize immunogenic cell death (ICD) and may play a role in cancer immunotherapy. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an immunogenic subtype of breast cancer with higher lymphocyte infiltration. Here, we found that regorafenib, a multi-target angiokinase inhibitor previously known to suppress STAT3 signaling, induced DAMPs and cell death in TNBC cells. Regorafenib induced the expression of HMGB1 and CRT, and the release of ATP. Regorafenib-induced HMGB1 and CRT were attenuated following STAT3 overexpression. In a 4T1 syngeneic murine model, regorafenib treatment increased HMGB1 and CRT expression in xenografts, and effectively suppressed 4T1 tumor growth. Immunohistochemical staining revealed increased CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells in 4T1 xenografts following regorafenib treatment. Regorafenib treatment or programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade using anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody reduced lung metastasis of 4T1 cells in immunocompetent mice. While regorafenib increases the proportion of MHC II high expression on dendritic cells in mice with smaller tumors, the combination of regorafenib and PD-1 blockade did not show a synergistic effect on anti-tumor activity. These results suggest that regorafenib induces ICD and suppresses tumor progression in TNBC. It should be carefully evaluated when developing a combination therapy with an anti-PD-1 antibody and a STAT3 inhibitor.

Abstract: Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) have evolved as a promising entity for developing diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. We profiled global EV proteome of EVs from Human retinal cells (ARPE-19) infected with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and subjected to LC-MS/MS for proteome analysis. In S. aureus infection, sequest identified 864 proteins, of which 81 were differentially expressed in comparison to control. Similarly, in P. aeruginosa infection, of 516 proteins identified, 86 were differentially expressed. Additionally, 38 proteins were exclusive to infected sets. KEGG and Gene Ontology revealed crucial dysregulated pathways involving proteins such as complement cascades, annexins and calpain-2, all playing major role in the pathogenesis of the disease. This study provides insight into the global EV proteome of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis with their functional correlation and distinctive pattern of expression. Calpain-2 and C8a are attractive biomarkers for bacterial endophthalmitis.

Abstract: Summary
The IMPACC cohort, composed of >1,000 hospitalized COVID-19 participants, contains five illness trajectory groups (TGs) during acute infection (first 28 days), ranging from milder (TG1–3) to more severe disease course (TG4) and death (TG5). Here, we report deep immunophenotyping, profiling of >15,000 longitudinal blood and nasal samples from 540 participants of the IMPACC cohort, using 14 distinct assays. These unbiased analyses identify cellular and molecular signatures present within 72 h of hospital admission that distinguish moderate from severe and fatal COVID-19 disease. Importantly, cellular and molecular states also distinguish participants with more severe disease that recover or stabilize within 28 days from those that progress to fatal outcomes (TG4 vs. TG5). Furthermore, our longitudinal design reveals that these biologic states display distinct temporal patterns associated with clinical outcomes. Characterizing host immune responses in relation to heterogeneity in disease course may inform clinical prognosis and opportunities for intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Adult-born cells, arriving daily into the rodent olfactory bulb, either integrate into the neural circuitry or get eliminated. However, whether these two populations differ in their morphological or functional properties remains unclear. Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging, we monitored dendritic morphogenesis, odor-evoked responsiveness, ongoing Ca2+ signaling, and survival/death of adult-born juxtaglomerular neurons (abJGNs). We found that the maturation of abJGNs is accompanied by a significant reduction in dendritic complexity, with surviving and subsequently eliminated cells showing similar degrees of dendritic remodeling. Surprisingly, ∼63% of eliminated abJGNs acquired odor responsiveness before death, with amplitudes and time courses of odor-evoked responses similar to those recorded in surviving cells. However, the subsequently eliminated cell population exhibited significantly higher ongoing Ca2+ signals, with a difference visible even 10 days before death. Quantitative supervised machine learning analysis revealed a relationship between the abJGNs’ activity and survival probability, with low neuronal activity being supportive for survival.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of function of inhibitory immune checkpoints, unleashing pathogenic immune responses, is a potential risk factor for autoimmune disease. Here, we report that patients with the autoimmune vasculitis giant cell arteritis (GCA) have a defective CD155-CD96 immune checkpoint. Macrophages from patients with GCA retain the checkpoint ligand CD155 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and fail to bring it to the cell surface. CD155low antigen-presenting cells induce expansion of CD4+CD96+ T cells, which become tissue invasive, accumulate in the blood vessel wall, and release the effector cytokine interleukin-9 (IL-9). In a humanized mouse model of GCA, recombinant human IL-9 causes vessel wall destruction, whereas anti-IL-9 antibodies efficiently suppress innate and adaptive immunity in the vasculitic lesions. Thus, defective surface translocation of CD155 creates antigen-presenting cells that deviate T cell differentiation toward Th9 lineage commitment and results in the expansion of vasculitogenic effector T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) remain a healthcare problem due to high rates of relapsing/recurrent CDIs (rCDIs). Breakdown of colonization resistance promoted by broad-spectrum antibiotics and the persistence of spores contribute to rCDI. Here, we demonstrate antimicrobial activity of the natural product class of chlorotonils against C. difficile. In contrast to vancomycin, chlorotonil A (ChA) efficiently inhibits disease and prevents rCDI in mice. Notably, ChA affects the murine and porcine microbiota to a lesser extent than vancomycin, largely preserving microbiota composition and minimally impacting the intestinal metabolome. Correspondingly, ChA treatment does not break colonization resistance against C. difficile and is linked to faster recovery of the microbiota after CDI. Additionally, ChA accumulates in the spore and inhibits outgrowth of C. difficile spores, thus potentially contributing to lower rates of rCDI. We conclude that chlorotonils have unique antimicrobial properties targeting critical steps in the infection cycle of C. difficile.

Abstract: Summary
A major challenge to rationally building multi-gene processes in yeast arises due to the combinatorics of combining all of the individual edits into the same strain. Here, we present a precise and multi-site genome editing approach that combines all edits without selection markers using CRISPR-Cas9. We demonstrate a highly efficient gene drive that selectively eliminates specific loci by integrating CRISPR-Cas9-mediated double-strand break (DSB) generation and homology-directed recombination with yeast sexual assortment. The method enables marker-less enrichment and recombination of genetically engineered loci (MERGE). We show that MERGE converts single heterologous loci to homozygous loci at ∼100% efficiency, independent of chromosomal location. Furthermore, MERGE is equally efficient at converting and combining multiple loci, thus identifying compatible genotypes. Finally, we establish MERGE proficiency by engineering a fungal carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and most of the human α-proteasome core into yeast. Therefore, MERGE lays the foundation for scalable, combinatorial genome editing in yeast.

Abstract: Summary
Although the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into various types of blood cells has been well established, approaches for clinical-scale production of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) remain challenging. We found that hiPSCs cocultured with stromal cells as spheroids (hematopoietic spheroids [Hp-spheroids]) can grow in a stirred bioreactor and develop into yolk sac-like organoids without the addition of exogenous factors. Hp-spheroid-induced organoids recapitulated a yolk sac-characteristic cellular complement and structures as well as the functional ability to generate HPCs with lympho-myeloid potential. Moreover, sequential hemato-vascular ontogenesis could also be observed during organoid formation. We demonstrated that organoid-induced HPCs can be differentiated into erythroid cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes with current maturation protocols. Notably, the Hp-spheroid system can be performed in an autologous and xeno-free manner, thereby improving the feasibility of bulk production of hiPSC-derived HPCs in clinical, therapeutic contexts.

Abstract: As a member of Ubiquitin-specific protease subfamily, ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7) has been reported to participate in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage response, and epigenetic modification. However, its function in preimplantation embryos is still obscure. To investigate the functions of USP7 during preimplantation embryo development, we used siRNA to degrade endogenous USP7 messenger RNA. We found that USP7 knockdown significantly decreased the development rate of mouse early embryos. Moreover, depletion of USP7 induced the accumulation of the DNA lesions and apoptotic blastomeres in early embryos. In addition, USP7 knockdown caused an abnormal H3K27me3 modification in 2-cell embryos. Overall, our results indicate that USP7 maintains genome stability perhaps via regulating H3K27me3 and DNA damage, consequently controlling the embryo quality.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly invasive malignant tumor with pronounced proliferation capacity and is prone to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and subsequent metastasis. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-like decysin 1 (ADAMDEC1) is a proteolytically active metzincin metalloprotease that is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell adhesion, invasion, and migration. However, the effects of ADAMDEC1 on CRC are unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the expression and biological role of ADAMDEC1 in CRC. We found that ADAMDEC1 was differentially expressed in CRC. Further, ADAMDEC1 was found to enhance CRC proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis. Exogenous ADAMDEC1 overexpression elicited EMT in CRC cells, as evidenced by alterations in E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin expression. In ADAMDEC1 knockdown or ADAMDEC1 overexpressed CRC cells, the western blotting analysis revealed that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins were down-regulated or up-regulated. Furthermore, an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (FH535) partially negated the effect of ADAMDEC1 overexpression on EMT and CRC cell proliferation. Further mechanistic research suggested that ADAMDEC1 knockdown may upregulate GSK-3β and inactivate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, accompanied by suppressing the expression of β-catenin. Additionally, the blocker of GSK-3β (CHIR-99021) markedly abolished the inhibitory effect of ADAMDEC1 knockdown on Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our results indicate that ADAMDEC1 promotes CRC metastasis by negatively regulating GSK-3β, activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and inducing EMT, presenting its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of metastatic CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1), a key mediator of glutamatergic signaling, is frequently overexpressed in tumor cells and is an attractive drug target for most cancers. Here, we present a targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy strategy that antagonistically recognizes mGluR1 and eradicates mGluR1+ human tumors by harnessing a small-molecule alpha (α)-emitting radiopharmaceutical, 211At-AITM. A single dose of 211At-AITM (2.96 MBq) in mGluR1+ cancers exhibits long-lasting in vivo antitumor efficacy across seven subtypes of four of the most common tumors, namely, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and colon cancers, with little toxicity. Moreover, complete regression of mGluR1+ breast cancer and pancreatic cancer is observed in approximate 50% of tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistically, the functions of 211At-AITM are uncovered in downregulating mGluR1 oncoprotein and inducing senescence of tumor cells with a reprogrammed senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Our findings suggest α-radiopharmaceutical therapy with 211At-AITM can be a useful strategy for mGluR1+ pan-cancers, regardless of their tissue of origin.

Abstract: Summary
The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus frequently colonizes the inflamed skin of people with atopic dermatitis (AD) and worsens disease severity by promoting skin damage. Here, we show, by longitudinally tracking 23 children treated for AD, that S. aureus adapts via de novo mutations during colonization. Each patient’s S. aureus population is dominated by a single lineage, with infrequent invasion by distant lineages. Mutations emerge within each lineage at rates similar to those of S. aureus in other contexts. Some variants spread across the body within months, with signatures of adaptive evolution. Most strikingly, mutations in capsule synthesis gene capD underwent parallel evolution in one patient and across-body sweeps in two patients. We confirm that capD negativity is more common in AD than in other contexts, via reanalysis of S. aureus genomes from 276 people. Together, these findings highlight the importance of the mutation level when dissecting the role of microbes in complex disease.

Abstract: Colon cancer is a cancer with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (RIPK2) has been identified as a proto-oncogene, but its role in colon cancer is largely unknown. Herein, we found that RIPK2 interference could inhibit the proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells, and promote apoptosis. Baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (BIRC3) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which was found highly expressed in colon cancer cells. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments showed that RIPK2 could directly bind with BIRC3. Then, we demonstrated that RIPK2 overexpression promoted the expression of BIRC3, BIRC3 interference could eliminate RIPK2-dependent cell proliferation and invasion, and BIRC3 overexpression rescued the suppressive effect of RIPK2 interference on cell proliferation and invasion. We further identified IKBKG, an inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B, as a ubiquitination substrate targeted by BIRC3. IKBKG interference could eliminate the inhibitory effect of BIRC3 interference on cell invasion. RIPK2 could promote BIRC3-mediated ubiquitination of IKBKG, inhibit the expression of IKBKG protein, and promote the expression of NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 proteins. In addition, DLD-1 cells transfected with sh-RIPK2 or/and sh-BIRC3 were injected into mice to establish a tumor xenograft model, and we found that administration of sh-RIPK2 or sh-BIRC3 impeded the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo, and co-administration displayed a better inhibitory effect. In general, RIPK2 promotes the progression of colon cancer by promoting BIRC3-mediated ubiquitination of IKBKG and activating the NF-κB signaling pathway.

Abstract: Cell stiffness and T-box transcription factor 3 (TBX3) expression have been identified as biomarkers of melanoma metastasis in 2D environments. This study aimed to determine how mechanical and biochemical properties of melanoma cells change during cluster formation in 3D environments. Vertical growth phase (VGP) and metastatic (MET) melanoma cells were embedded in 3D collagen matrices of 2 and 4 mg/ml collagen concentrations, representing low and high matrix stiffness. Mitochondrial fluctuation, intracellular stiffness, and TBX3 expression were quantified before and during cluster formation. In isolated cells, mitochondrial fluctuation decreased and intracellular stiffness increased with increase in disease stage from VGP to MET and increased matrix stiffness. TBX3 was highly expressed in soft matrices but diminished in stiff matrices for VGP and MET cells. Cluster formation of VGP cells was excessive in soft matrices but limited in stiff matrices, whereas for MET cells it was limited in soft and stiff matrices. In soft matrices, VGP cells did not change the intracellular properties, whereas MET cells exhibited increased mitochondrial fluctuation and decreased TBX3 expression. In stiff matrices, mitochondrial fluctuation and TBX3 expression increased in VGP and MET, and intracellular stiffness increased in VGP but decreased in MET cells. The findings suggest that soft extracellular environments are more favourable for tumour growth, and high TBX3 levels mediate collective cell migration and tumour growth in the earlier VGP disease stage but play a lesser role in the later metastatic stage of melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Limited evidence exists on the impact of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) on tumor evolution, clinical outcomes, and surgical operability. We perform systematic multi-site tumor mapping at presentation and matched relapse from 49 high-tumor-burden patients, operated up front. From SNP array-derived copy-number data, we categorize dendrograms representing tumor clonal evolution as sympodial or dichotomous, noting most chemo-resistant patients favor simpler sympodial evolution. Three distinct tumor evolutionary patterns from primary to relapse are identified, demonstrating recurrent disease may emerge from pre-existing or newly detected clones. Crucially, we identify spatial heterogeneity for clinically actionable homologous recombination deficiency scores and for poor prognosis biomarkers CCNE1 and MYC. Copy-number signature, phenotypic, proteomic, and proliferative-index heterogeneity further highlight HGSOC complexity. This study explores HGSOC evolution and dissemination across space and time, its impact on optimal surgical cytoreductive effort and clinical outcomes, and its consequences for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Cellular homeostasis requires the use of multiple environmental sensors that can respond to a variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is classically known as a transcription factor that induces genes that encode drug metabolizing enzymes when bound to toxicants such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-ρ-dioxin (TCDD). The receptor has a growing number of putative endogenous ligands, such as tryptophan, cholesterol, and heme metabolites. Many of these compounds are also linked to the translocator protein (TSPO), an outer mitochondrial membrane protein. Given a portion of the cellular pool of the AHR has also been localized to mitochondria and the overlap in putative ligands, we tested the hypothesis that crosstalk exists between the two proteins. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to create knockouts for AHR and TSPO in a mouse lung epithelial cell line (MLE-12). WT, AHR−/−, and TSPO−/− cells were then exposed to AHR ligand (TCDD), TSPO ligand (PK11195), or both and RNA-seq was performed. More mitochondrial-related genes were altered by loss of both AHR and TSPO than would have been expected just by chance. Some of the genes altered included those that encode for components of the electron transport system and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter. Both proteins altered the activity of the other as AHR loss caused the increase of TSPO at both the mRNA and protein level and loss of TSPO significantly increased the expression of classic AHR battery genes after TCDD treatment. This research provides evidence that AHR and TSPO participate in similar pathways that contribute to mitochondrial homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations that compromise the expression and/or function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. Most people with CF harbor a common misfolded variant (ΔF508) that can be partially rescued by therapeutic “correctors” that restore its expression. Nevertheless, many other CF variants are insensitive to correctors. Using deep mutational scanning, we quantitatively compare the effects of two correctors on the plasma membrane expression of 129 CF variants. Though structural calculations suggest corrector binding provides similar stabilization to most variants, it’s those with intermediate expression and mutations near corrector binding pockets that exhibit the greatest response. Deviations in sensitivity appear to depend on the degree of variant destabilization and the timing of misassembly. Combining correctors appears to rescue more variants by doubling the binding energy and stabilizing distinct cotranslational folding transitions. These results provide an overview of rare CF variant expression and establish new tools for precision pharmacology.

Abstract: Summary
Treating and preventing infections by antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pathogens is a worldwide problem. Pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus produce an array of virulence determinants, making it difficult to identify single targets for the development of vaccines or monoclonal therapies. We described a human-derived anti-S. aureus monoclonal antibody (mAb)-centyrin fusion protein (“mAbtyrin”) that simultaneously targets multiple bacterial adhesins, resists proteolysis by bacterial protease GluV8, avoids Fc engagement by S. aureus IgG-binding proteins SpA and Sbi, and neutralizes pore-forming leukocidins via fusion with anti-toxin centyrins, while maintaining Fc- and complement-mediated functions. Compared with the parental mAb, mAbtyrin protected human phagocytes and boosted phagocyte-mediated killing. The mAbtyrin also reduced pathology, reduced bacterial burden, and protected from different types of infections in preclinical animal models. Finally, mAbtyrin synergized with vancomycin, enhancing pathogen clearance in an animal model of bacteremia. Altogether, these data establish the potential of multivalent mAbs for treating and preventing S. aureus diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The lack of preparedness for detecting and responding to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen (i.e., COVID-19) has caused enormous harm to public health and the economy. Testing strategies deployed on a population scale at day zero, i.e., the time of the first reported case, would be of significant value. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has such capabilities; however, it has limited detection sensitivity for low-copy-number pathogens. Here, we leverage the CRISPR-Cas9 system to effectively remove abundant sequences not contributing to pathogen detection and show that NGS detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 approaches that of RT-qPCR. The resulting sequence data can also be used for variant strain typing, co-infection detection, and individual human host response assessment, all in a single molecular and analysis workflow. This NGS work flow is pathogen agnostic and, therefore, has the potential to transform how large-scale pandemic response and focused clinical infectious disease testing are pursued in the future.
