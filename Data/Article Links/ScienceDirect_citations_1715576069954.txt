Abstract: Summary
Stem cell transplantation presents a potentially curative strategy for genetic disorders of skeletal muscle, but this approach is limited by the deleterious effects of cell expansion in vitro and consequent poor engraftment efficiency. In an effort to overcome this limitation, we sought to identify molecular signals that enhance the myogenic activity of cultured muscle progenitors. Here, we report the development and application of a cross-species small-molecule screening platform employing zebrafish and mice, which enables rapid, direct evaluation of the effects of chemical compounds on the engraftment of transplanted muscle precursor cells. Using this system, we screened a library of bioactive lipids to discriminate those that could increase myogenic engraftment in vivo in zebrafish and mice. This effort identified two lipids, lysophosphatidic acid and niflumic acid, both linked to the activation of intracellular calcium-ion flux, which showed conserved, dose-dependent, and synergistic effects in promoting muscle engraftment across these vertebrate species.

Abstract: Summary
Although the role of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in extracellular RNA (exRNA) biology is well established, their exRNA cargo and distribution across biofluids are largely unknown. To address this gap, we extend the exRNA Atlas resource by mapping exRNAs carried by extracellular RBPs (exRBPs). This map was developed through an integrative analysis of ENCODE enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) data (150 RBPs) and human exRNA profiles (6,930 samples). Computational analysis and experimental validation identified exRBPs in plasma, serum, saliva, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and cell-culture-conditioned medium. exRBPs carry exRNA transcripts from small non-coding RNA biotypes, including microRNA (miRNA), piRNA, tRNA, small nuclear RNA (snRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), Y RNA, and lncRNA, as well as protein-coding mRNA fragments. Computational deconvolution of exRBP RNA cargo reveals associations of exRBPs with extracellular vesicles, lipoproteins, and ribonucleoproteins across human biofluids. Overall, we mapped the distribution of exRBPs across human biofluids, presenting a resource for the community.

Abstract: Summary
Brain states are frequently represented using a unidimensional scale measuring the richness of subjective experience (level of consciousness). This description assumes a mapping between the high-dimensional space of whole-brain configurations and the trajectories of brain states associated with changes in consciousness, yet this mapping and its properties remain unclear. We combine whole-brain modeling, data augmentation, and deep learning for dimensionality reduction to determine a mapping representing states of consciousness in a low-dimensional space, where distances parallel similarities between states. An orderly trajectory from wakefulness to patients with brain injury is revealed in a latent space whose coordinates represent metrics related to functional modularity and structure-function coupling, increasing alongside loss of consciousness. Finally, we investigate the effects of model perturbations, providing geometrical interpretation for the stability and reversibility of states. We conclude that conscious awareness depends on functional patterns encoded as a low-dimensional trajectory within the vast space of brain configurations.

Abstract: Summary
Common variable immune deficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by recurrent infections, low levels of serum immunoglobulins, and impaired vaccine responses. Autoimmune manifestations are common, but B cell central and peripheral selection mechanisms in CVID are incompletely understood. Here, we find that receptor editing, a measure of central tolerance, is increased in transitional B cells from CVID patients and that these cells have a higher immunoglobulin κ:λ ratio in CVID patients with autoimmune manifestations than in those with infection only. Contrariwise, the selection pressure in the germinal center on CD27bright memory B cells is decreased in CVID patients with autoimmune manifestations. Finally, functionally, T cell-dependent activation showed that naive B cells in CVID patients are badly equipped for activation and induction of mismatch repair genes. We conclude that central tolerance is functional whereas peripheral selection is defective in CVID patients with autoimmune manifestations, which could underpin the development of autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
Structurally complex genomic regions, such as centromeres, are inherently difficult to duplicate. The mechanism behind centromere inheritance is not well understood, and one of the key questions relates to the reassembly of centromeric chromatin following DNA replication. Here, we define ERCC6L2 as a key regulator of this process. ERCC6L2 accumulates at centromeres and promotes deposition of core centromeric factors. Interestingly, ERCC6L2−/− cells show unrestrained replication of centromeric DNA, likely caused by the erosion of centromeric chromatin. Beyond centromeres, ERCC6L2 facilitates replication at genomic repeats and non-canonical DNA structures. Notably, ERCC6L2 interacts with the DNA-clamp PCNA through an atypical peptide, presented here in a co-crystal structure. Finally, ERCC6L2 also restricts DNA end resection, acting independently of the 53BP1-REV7-Shieldin complex. We propose a mechanistic model, which reconciles seemingly distinct functions of ERCC6L2 in DNA repair and DNA replication. These findings provide a molecular context for studies linking ERCC6L2 to human disease.

TERRA stability is regulated by RALY and polyadenylation in a telomere-specific manner,

Abstract: Summary
Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) is a long non-coding RNA transcribed from telomeres that plays key roles in telomere maintenance. A fraction of TERRA is polyadenylated, and the presence of the poly(A) tail influences TERRA localization and stability. However, the mechanisms of TERRA biogenesis remain mostly elusive. Here, we show that the stability of TERRA transcripts is regulated by the RNA-binding protein associated with lethal yellow mutation (RALY). RALY depletion results in lower TERRA levels, impaired localization of TERRA at telomeres, and ultimately telomere damage. Importantly, we show that TERRA polyadenylation is telomere specific and that RALY preferentially stabilizes non-polyadenylated TERRA transcripts. Finally, we report that TERRA interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1). Altogether, our results indicate that TERRA stability is regulated by the interplay between RALY and PABPN1, defined by the TERRA polyadenylation state. Our findings also suggest that different telomeres may trigger distinct TERRA-mediated responses.

Abstract: Summary
Left-right (LR) asymmetry of the brain is fundamental to its higher-order functions. The Drosophila brain’s asymmetrical body (AB) consists of a structural pair arborized from AB neurons and is larger on the right side than the left. We find that the AB initially forms LR symmetrically and then develops LR asymmetrically by neurite remodeling that is specific to the left AB and is dynamin dependent. Additionally, neuronal ecdysone signaling inhibition randomizes AB laterality, suggesting that ecdysone signaling determines AB’s LR polarity. Given that AB’s LR asymmetry relates to memory formation, our research establishes AB as a valuable model for studying LR asymmetry and higher-order brain function relationships.

Abstract: Summary
Even-chain acylcarnitine (AC) metabolites, most of which are generated as byproducts of incomplete fatty acid oxidation (FAO), are viewed as biomarkers of mitochondrial lipid stress attributable to one or more metabolic bottlenecks in the β-oxidation pathway. The origins and functional implications of FAO bottlenecks remain poorly understood. Here, we combined a sophisticated mitochondrial phenotyping platform with state-of-the-art molecular profiling tools and multiple two-state mouse models of respiratory function to uncover a mechanism that connects AC accumulation to lipid intolerance, metabolic inflexibility, and respiratory inefficiency in skeletal muscle mitochondria. These studies also identified a short-chain carbon circuit at the C4 node of FAO wherein reverse flux of glucose-derived acetyl CoA through medium-chain ketothiolase enhances lipid tolerance and redox stability in heart mitochondria by regenerating free CoA and NAD+. The findings help to explain why diminished FAO capacity, AC accumulation, and metabolic inflexibility are tightly linked to poor health outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
The P-type ATPase ATP7B exports cytosolic copper and plays an essential role in the regulation of cellular copper homeostasis. Mutants of ATP7B cause Wilson disease (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human ATP7B in the E1 state in the apo, the putative copper-bound, and the putative cisplatin-bound forms. In ATP7B, the N-terminal sixth metal-binding domain (MBD6) binds at the cytosolic copper entry site of the transmembrane domain (TMD), facilitating the delivery of copper from the MBD6 to the TMD. The sulfur-containing residues in the TMD of ATP7B mark the copper transport pathway. By comparing structures of the E1 state human ATP7B and E2-Pi state frog ATP7B, we propose the ATP-driving copper transport model of ATP7B. These structures not only advance our understanding of the mechanisms of ATP7B-mediated copper export but can also guide the development of therapeutics for the treatment of WD.

Abstract: Growth hormone (GH) deficiency is characterized by impaired growth and development, and is currently treated by repeated administration of recombinant human GH (hGH). Encapsulated cell therapy (ECT) may offer a less demanding treatment-strategy for long-term production and release of GH into circulation. We used PiggyBac-based (PB) transposon delivery for engineering retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19), and tested a series of viral and non-viral promoters as well as codon-optimization to enhance transgene expression. Engineered cells were loaded into TheraCyte macrocapsules and secretion was followed in vitro and in vivo. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter supports strong and persistent transgene expression, and we achieved clonal cell lines secreting over 6 µg hGH/106 cells/day. Codon-optimization of the hGH gene did not improve secretion. ARPE-19 cells endured encapsulation in TheraCyte devices, and resulted in steady hormone release for at least 60 days in vitro. A short-term pilot experiment in immunodeficient SCID mice demonstrated low systemic levels of hGH from a single 40 µL capsule implanted subcutaneously. No significant increase in weight increase or systemic hGH was detected after 23 days in the GH-deficient lit/SCID mouse model using 4.5 µL capsules loaded with the highest secreting clone of ARPE-19 cells. Our results demonstrate that PB-mediated engineering of ARPE-19 is an efficient way to generate hormone secreting cell lines compatible with macroencapsulation, and our CMV-driven expression cassette allows for identification of clones with high level and long-term secretory activity without addition of insulator elements. Our results pave the way for further in vivo studies of encapsulated cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Striking antibody evasion by emerging circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants drives the identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). However, how a bNAb acquires increased neutralization breadth during antibody evolution is still elusive. Here, we identify a clonally related antibody family from a convalescent individual. One of the members, XG005, exhibits potent and broad neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 variants, while the other members show significant reductions in neutralization breadth and potency, especially against the Omicron sublineages. Structural analysis visualizing the XG005-Omicron spike binding interface reveals how crucial somatic mutations endow XG005 with greater neutralization potency and breadth. A single administration of XG005 with extended half-life, reduced antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, and increased antibody product quality exhibits a high therapeutic efficacy in BA.2- and BA.5-challenged mice. Our results provide a natural example to show the importance of somatic hypermutation during antibody evolution for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization breadth and potency.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic variants, including mobile element insertions (MEIs), are known to impact the epigenome. We hypothesized that genome graphs, which encapsulate genetic diversity, could reveal missing epigenomic signals. To test this, we sequenced the epigenome of monocyte-derived macrophages from 35 ancestrally diverse individuals before and after influenza infection, allowing us to investigate the role of MEIs in immunity. We characterized genetic variants and MEIs using linked reads and built a genome graph. Mapping epigenetic data revealed 2.3%–3% novel peaks for H3K4me1, H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and ATAC-seq. Additionally, the use of a genome graph modified some quantitative trait loci estimates and revealed 375 polymorphic MEIs in an active epigenomic state. Among these is an AluYh3 polymorphism whose chromatin state changed after infection and was associated with the expression of TRIM25, a gene that restricts influenza RNA synthesis. Our results demonstrate that graph genomes can reveal regulatory regions that would have been overlooked by other approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic mutations have important biological ramifications while exerting substantial rate, type, and genomic location heterogeneity. Yet, their sporadic occurrence makes them difficult to study at scale and across individuals. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), a model system for human population and functional genomics, harbor large numbers of somatic mutations and have been extensively genotyped. By comparing 1,662 LCLs, we report that the mutational landscape of the genome varies across individuals in terms of the number of mutations, their genomic locations, and their spectra; this variation may itself be modulated by somatic trans-acting mutations. Mutations attributed to the translesion DNA polymerase η follow two different modes of formation, with one mode accounting for the hypermutability of the inactive X chromosome. Nonetheless, the distribution of mutations along the inactive X chromosome appears to follow an epigenetic memory of the active form.

Abstract: Summary
The luminal epithelium of the mammary gland is organized into monolayers; however, it originates from multilayered terminal end buds (TEBs) during development. Although apoptosis provides a plausible mechanism for cavitation of the ductal lumen, it doesn’t account for ductal elongation behind TEBs. Spatial calculations in mice suggest that most TEB cells integrate into the outermost luminal layer to generate elongation. We developed a quantitative cell culture assay that models intercalation into epithelial monolayers. We found that tight junction proteins play a key role in this process. ZO-1 puncta form at the new cellular interface and resolve into a new boundary as intercalation proceeds. Deleting ZO-1 suppresses intercalation both in culture and in cells transplanted into mammary glands via intraductal injection. Cytoskeletal rearrangements at the interface are critical for intercalation. These data identify luminal cell rearrangements necessary for mammary development and suggest a mechanism for integration of cells into an existing monolayer.

Abstract: Summary
We measure transcriptional noise in yeast by analyzing chromatin structure and transcription of an 18-kb region of DNA whose sequence was randomly generated. Nucleosomes fully occupy random-sequence DNA, but nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) are much less frequent, and there are fewer well-positioned nucleosomes and shorter nucleosome arrays. Steady-state levels of random-sequence RNAs are comparable to yeast mRNAs, although transcription and decay rates are higher. Transcriptional initiation from random-sequence DNA occurs at numerous sites, indicating very low intrinsic specificity of the RNA Pol II machinery. In contrast, poly(A) profiles of random-sequence RNAs are roughly comparable to those of yeast mRNAs, suggesting limited evolutionary restraints on poly(A) site choice. Random-sequence RNAs show higher cell-to-cell variability than yeast mRNAs, suggesting that functional elements limit variability. These observations indicate that transcriptional noise occurs at high levels in yeast, and they provide insight into how chromatin and transcription patterns arise from the evolved yeast genome.

Abstract: Summary
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a common form of RCC, is responsible for the high mortality rate of kidney cancer. Dysregulations of glycoproteins have been shown to associate with ccRCC. However, the molecular mechanism has not been well characterized. Here, a comprehensive glycoproteomic analysis is conducted using 103 tumors and 80 paired normal adjacent tissues. Altered glycosylation enzymes and corresponding protein glycosylation are observed, while two of the major ccRCC mutations, BAP1 and PBRM1, show distinct glycosylation profiles. Additionally, inter-tumor heterogeneity and cross-correlation between glycosylation and phosphorylation are observed. The relation of glycoproteomic features to genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic changes shows the role of glycosylation in ccRCC development with potential for therapeutic interventions. This study reports a large-scale tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative glycoproteomic analysis of ccRCC that can serve as a valuable resource for the community.

Abstract: Summary
TEAD transcription factors are responsible for the transcriptional output of Hippo signaling. TEAD activity is primarily regulated by phosphorylation of its coactivators, YAP and TAZ. In addition, cysteine palmitoylation has recently been shown to regulate TEAD activity. Here, we report lysine long-chain fatty acylation as a posttranslational modification of TEADs. Lysine fatty acylation occurs spontaneously via intramolecular transfer of acyl groups from the proximal acylated cysteine residue. Lysine fatty acylation, like cysteine palmitoylation, contributes to the transcriptional activity of TEADs by enhancing the interaction with YAP and TAZ, but it is more stable than cysteine acylation, suggesting that the lysine fatty-acylated TEAD acts as a “stable active form.” Significantly, lysine fatty acylation of TEAD increased upon Hippo signaling activation despite a decrease in cysteine acylation. Our results provide insight into the role of fatty-acyl modifications in the regulation of TEAD activity.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advances in synthetic embryology have opened new avenues for understanding the complex events controlling mammalian peri-implantation development. Here, we show that mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) solely exposed to chemical inhibition of SUMOylation generate embryo-like structures comprising anterior neural and trunk-associated regions. HypoSUMOylation-instructed ESCs give rise to spheroids that self-organize into gastrulating structures containing cell types spatially and functionally related to embryonic and extraembryonic compartments. Alternatively, spheroids cultured in a droplet microfluidic device form elongated structures that undergo axial organization reminiscent of natural embryo morphogenesis. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals various cellular lineages, including properly positioned anterior neuronal cell types and paraxial mesoderm segmented into somite-like structures. Transient SUMOylation suppression gradually increases DNA methylation genome wide and repressive mark deposition at Nanog. Interestingly, cell-to-cell variations in SUMOylation levels occur during early embryogenesis. Our approach provides a proof of principle for potentially powerful strategies to explore early embryogenesis by targeting chromatin roadblocks of cell fate change.

Abstract: Summary
Lipolysis of stored triglycerides is stimulated via β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling and inhibited via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). In type 2 diabetes, a dysregulation in the storage/lipolysis of triglycerides leads to lipotoxicity. Here, we hypothesize that white adipocytes regulate their lipolytic responses via the formation of subcellular cAMP microdomains. To test this, we investigate real-time cAMP/PDE dynamics at the single-cell level in human white adipocytes with a highly sensitive florescent biosensor and uncover the presence of several receptor-associated cAMP microdomains where cAMP signals are compartmentalized to differentially regulate lipolysis. In insulin resistance, we also detect cAMP microdomain dysregulation mechanisms that promote lipotoxicity, but regulation can be restored by the anti-diabetic drug metformin. Therefore, we present a powerful live-cell imaging technique capable of resolving disease-driven alterations in cAMP/PDE signaling at the subcellular level and provide evidence to support the therapeutic potential of targeting these microdomains.

Abstract: Summary
Upon activation, vinculin reinforces cytoskeletal anchorage during cell adhesion. Activating ligands classically disrupt intramolecular interactions between the vinculin head and tail domains that bind to actin filaments. Here, we show that Shigella IpaA triggers major allosteric changes in the head domain, leading to vinculin homo-oligomerization. Through the cooperative binding of its three vinculin-binding sites (VBSs), IpaA induces a striking reorientation of the D1 and D2 head subdomains associated with vinculin oligomerization. IpaA thus acts as a catalyst producing vinculin clusters that bundle actin at a distance from the activation site and trigger the formation of highly stable adhesions resisting the action of actin relaxing drugs. Unlike canonical activation, vinculin homo-oligomers induced by IpaA appear to keep a persistent imprint of the activated state in addition to their bundling activity, accounting for stable cell adhesion independent of force transduction and relevant to bacterial invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Sea urchins are emblematic models in developmental biology and display several characteristics that set them apart from other deuterostomes. To uncover the genomic cues that may underlie these specificities, we generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly for the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and an extensive gene expression and epigenetic profiles of its embryonic development. We found that, unlike vertebrates, sea urchins retained ancestral chromosomal linkages but underwent very fast intrachromosomal gene order mixing. We identified a burst of gene duplication in the echinoid lineage and showed that some of these expanded genes have been recruited in novel structures (water vascular system, Aristotle’s lantern, and skeletogenic micromere lineage). Finally, we identified gene-regulatory modules conserved between sea urchins and chordates. Our results suggest that gene-regulatory networks controlling development can be conserved despite extensive gene order rearrangement.

Abstract: Summary
Interfacial tension governs the behaviors and physiological functions of multiple biological condensates during diverse biological processes. Little is known about whether there are cellular surfactant factors that regulate the interfacial tension and functions of biological condensates within physiological environments. TFEB, a master transcription factor that controls expression of autophagic-lysosomal genes, assembles into transcriptional condensates to control the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). Here, we show that interfacial tension modulates the transcriptional activity of TFEB condensates. MLX, MYC, and IPMK act as synergistic surfactants to decrease the interfacial tension and consequent DNA affinity of TFEB condensates. The interfacial tension of TFEB condensates is quantitatively correlated to their DNA affinity and subsequent ALP activity. The interfacial tension and DNA affinity of condensates formed by TAZ-TEAD4 are also regulated by the synergistic surfactant proteins RUNX3 and HOXA4. Our results indicate that the interfacial tension and functions of biological condensates can be controlled by cellular surfactant proteins in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Adherent cells migrate on layered tissue interfaces to drive morphogenesis, wound healing, and tumor invasion. Although stiffer surfaces are known to enhance cell migration, it remains unclear whether cells sense basal stiff environments buried under softer, fibrous matrix. Using layered collagen-polyacrylamide gel systems, we unveil a migration phenotype driven by cell-matrix polarity. Here, cancer (but not normal) cells with stiff base matrix generate stable protrusions, faster migration, and greater collagen deformation because of “depth mechanosensing” through the top collagen layer. Cancer cell protrusions with front-rear polarity produce polarized collagen stiffening and deformations. Disruption of either extracellular or intracellular polarity via collagen crosslinking, laser ablation, or Arp2/3 inhibition independently abrogates depth-mechanosensitive migration of cancer cells. Our experimental findings, validated by lattice-based energy minimization modeling, present a cell migration mechanism whereby polarized cellular protrusions and contractility are reciprocated by mechanical extracellular polarity, culminating in a cell-type-dependent ability to mechanosense through matrix layers.

Abstract: Summary
The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest neural stem cell (NSC) niche in the adult brain; herein, the blood-brain barrier is leaky, allowing direct interactions between NSCs and endothelial cells (ECs). Mechanisms by which direct NSC-EC interactions in the adult SVZ control NSC behavior are unclear. We found that Cx43 is highly expressed by SVZ NSCs and ECs, and its deletion in either leads to increased NSC proliferation and neuroblast generation, suggesting that Cx43-mediated NSC-EC interactions maintain NSC quiescence. This is further supported by single-cell RNA sequencing and in vitro studies showing that ECs control NSC proliferation by regulating expression of genes associated with NSC quiescence and/or activation in a Cx43-dependent manner. Cx43 mediates these effects in a channel-independent manner involving its cytoplasmic tail and ERK activation. Such insights inform adult NSC regulation and maintenance aimed at stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: In the adult rodent brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus. In these areas, NSCs and their progeny integrate intrinsic signals and extrinsic cues provided by their microenvironment that control their behavior. The vasculature in the SVZ and SGZ, and the choroid plexus (ChP) in the SVZ, have emerged as critical compartments of the neurogenic niches as they provide a rich repertoire of cues to regulate NSC quiescence, proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation. Physical contact between NSCs and blood vessels is also a feature within the niches and supports different processes such as quiescence, migration and vesicle transport. In this review, we provide a description of the brain and choroid plexus vasculature in both stem cell niches, highlighting the main properties and role of the vasculature in each niche. We also summarize the current understanding of how blood vessel- and ChP-derived signals influence the behavior of NSCs in physiological adulthood, as well as upon aging.

Abstract: Summary
The nematode C. elegans uses mechanosensitive neurons to detect bacteria, which are food for worms. These neurons release dopamine to suppress foraging and promote dwelling. Through a screen of genes highly expressed in dopaminergic food-sensing neurons, we identify a K2P-family potassium channel—TWK-2—that damps their activity. Strikingly, loss of TWK-2 restores mechanosensation to neurons lacking the NOMPC-like channel transient receptor potential 4 (TRP-4), which was thought to be the primary mechanoreceptor for tactile food sensing. The alternate mechanoreceptor mechanism uncovered by TWK-2 mutation requires three Deg/ENaC channel subunits: ASIC-1, DEL-3, and UNC-8. Analysis of cell-physiological responses to mechanostimuli indicates that TRP and Deg/ENaC channels work together to set the range of analog encoding of stimulus intensity and to improve signal-to-noise characteristics and temporal fidelity of food-sensing neurons. We conclude that a specialized mechanosensory modality—tactile food sensing—emerges from coordination of distinct force-sensing mechanisms housed in one type of sensory neuron.

Abstract: Summary
Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is the primary factor that drives fibrosis in most forms of chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to identify endogenous regulators of TGF-β signaling and fibrosis. Here, we show that tubulointerstitial fibrosis is aggravated by global deletion of KLF13 and attenuated by adeno-associated virus-mediated KLF13 overexpression in renal tubular epithelial cells. KLF13 recruits a repressor complex comprising SIN3A and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the TGF-β target genes, limiting the profibrotic effects of TGF-β. Temporary upregulation of TGF-β induces KLF13 expression, creating a negative feedback loop that triggers the anti-fibrotic effect of KLF13. However, persistent activation of TGF-β signaling reduces KLF13 levels through FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination degradation and HDAC-dependent mechanisms to inhibit KLF13 transcription and offset the anti-fibrotic effect of KLF13. Collectively, our data demonstrate a role of KLF13 in regulating TGF-β signaling and fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Most cell types in multicellular organisms can perform multiple functions. However, not all functions can be optimally performed simultaneously by the same cells. Functions incompatible at the level of individual cells can be performed at the cell population level, where cells divide labor and specialize in different functions. Division of labor can arise due to instruction by tissue environment or through self-organization. Here, we develop a computational framework to investigate the contribution of these mechanisms to division of labor within a cell-type population. By optimizing collective cellular task performance under trade-offs, we find that distinguishable expression patterns can emerge from cell-cell interactions versus instructive signals. We propose a method to construct ligand-receptor networks between specialist cells and use it to infer division-of-labor mechanisms from single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics data of stromal, epithelial, and immune cells. Our framework can be used to characterize the complexity of cell interactions within tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Biomolecular condensates are membraneless structures formed through phase separation. Recent studies have demonstrated that the material properties of biomolecular condensates are crucial for their biological functions and pathogenicity. However, the phase maintenance of biomolecular condensates in cells remains elusive. Here, we show that sodium ion (Na+) influx regulates the condensate liquidity under hyperosmotic stress. ASK3 condensates have higher fluidity at the high intracellular Na+ concentration derived from extracellular hyperosmotic solution. Moreover, we identified TRPM4 as a cation channel that allows Na+ influx under hyperosmotic stress. TRPM4 inhibition causes the liquid-to-solid phase transition of ASK3 condensates, leading to impairment of the ASK3 osmoresponse. In addition to ASK3 condensates, intracellular Na+ widely regulates the condensate liquidity and aggregate formation of biomolecules, including DCP1A, TAZ, and polyQ-protein, under hyperosmotic stress. Our findings demonstrate that changes in Na+ contribute to the cellular stress response via liquidity maintenance of biomolecular condensates.

Abstract: Summary
Although chemotherapy plus PD-1 blockade (chemo+anti-PD-1) has become the standard first-line therapy for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), reliable biomarkers for this regimen are lacking. Here we perform whole-exome sequencing on tumor samples from 486 patients of the JUPITER-06 study and develop a copy number alteration-corrected tumor mutational burden that depicts immunogenicity more precisely and predicts chemo+anti-PD-1 efficacy. We identify several other favorable immunogenic features (e.g., HLA-I/II diversity) and risk oncogenic alterations (e.g., PIK3CA and TET2 mutation) associated with chemo+anti-PD-1 efficacy. An esophageal cancer genome-based immuno-oncology classification (EGIC) scheme incorporating these immunogenic features and oncogenic alterations is established. Chemo+anti-PD-1 achieves significant survival improvements in EGIC1 (immunogenic feature-favorable and oncogenic alteration-negative) and EGIC2 (either immunogenic feature-favorable or oncogenic alteration-negative) subgroups, but not the EGIC3 subgroup (immunogenic feature-unfavorable and oncogenic alteration-positive). Thus, EGIC may guide future individualized treatment strategies and inform mechanistic biomarker research for chemo+anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with advanced ESCC.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute/small RNA pathways and heterochromatin work together to propagate transgenerational gene silencing, but the mechanisms behind their interaction are not well understood. Here, we show that induction of heterochromatin silencing in C. elegans by RNAi or by artificially tethering pathway components to target RNA causes co-localization of target alleles in pachytene nuclei. Tethering the nuclear Argonaute WAGO-9/HRDE-1 induces heterochromatin formation and independently induces small RNA amplification. Consistent with this finding, HRDE-1, while predominantly nuclear, also localizes to peri-nuclear nuage domains, where amplification is thought to occur. Tethering a heterochromatin-silencing factor, NRDE-2, induces heterochromatin formation, which subsequently causes de novo synthesis of HRDE-1 guide RNAs. HRDE-1 then acts to further amplify small RNAs that load on downstream Argonautes. These findings suggest that HRDE-1 plays a dual role, acting upstream to initiate heterochromatin silencing and downstream to stimulate a new cycle of small RNA amplification, thus establishing a self-enforcing mechanism that propagates gene silencing to future generations.

Abstract: Summary
Cell competition acts as a quality-control mechanism that eliminates cells less fit than their neighbors to optimize organ development. Whether and how competitive interactions occur between neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the developing brain remains unknown. Here, we show that endogenous cell competition occurs and intrinsically correlates with the Axin2 expression level during normal brain development. Induction of genetic mosaicism predisposes Axin2-deficient NPCs to behave as “losers” in mice and undergo apoptotic elimination, but homogeneous ablation of Axin2 does not promote cell death. Mechanistically, Axin2 suppresses the p53 signaling pathway at the post-transcriptional level to maintain cell fitness, and Axin2-deficient cell elimination requires p53-dependent signaling. Furthermore, mosaic Trp53 deletion confers a “winner” status to p53-deficient cells that outcompete their neighbors. Conditional loss of both Axin2 and Trp53 increases cortical area and thickness, suggesting that the Axin2-p53 axis may coordinate to survey cell fitness, regulate natural cell competition, and optimize brain size during neurodevelopment.

Abstract: Summary
Removal of the intron from precursor-tRNA (pre-tRNA) is essential in all three kingdoms of life. In humans, this process is mediated by the tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) comprising four subunits: TSEN2, TSEN15, TSEN34, and TSEN54. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of human TSEN bound to full-length pre-tRNA in the pre-catalytic and post-catalytic states at average resolutions of 2.94 and 2.88 Å, respectively. Human TSEN features an extended surface groove that holds the L-shaped pre-tRNA. The mature domain of pre-tRNA is recognized by conserved structural elements of TSEN34, TSEN54, and TSEN2. Such recognition orients the anticodon stem of pre-tRNA and places the 3′-splice site and 5′-splice site into the catalytic centers of TSEN34 and TSEN2, respectively. The bulk of the intron sequences makes no direct interaction with TSEN, explaining why pre-tRNAs of varying introns can be accommodated and cleaved. Our structures reveal the molecular ruler mechanism of pre-tRNA cleavage by TSEN.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells provide immune defense against local infection and can inhibit cancer progression. However, it is unclear to what extent chronic inflammation impacts TRM activation and whether TRM cells existing in tissues before tumor onset influence cancer evolution in humans. We performed deep profiling of healthy lungs and lung cancers in never-smokers (NSs) and ever-smokers (ESs), finding evidence of enhanced immunosurveillance by cells with a TRM-like phenotype in ES lungs. In preclinical models, tumor-specific or bystander TRM-like cells present prior to tumor onset boosted immune cell recruitment, causing tumor immune evasion through loss of MHC class I protein expression and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. In humans, only tumors arising in ES patients underwent clonal immune evasion, unrelated to tobacco-associated mutagenic signatures or oncogenic drivers. These data demonstrate that enhanced TRM-like activity prior to tumor development shapes the evolution of tumor immunogenicity and can impact immunotherapy outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Dosage compensation, the balancing of X-linked gene expression between sexes and to the autosomes, is critical to an organism’s fitness and survival. In Drosophila, dosage compensation involves hypertranscription of the male X chromosome. Here, we use quantitative live imaging and modeling at single-cell resolution to study X chromosome dosage compensation in Drosophila. We show that the four X chromosome genes studied undergo transcriptional bursting in male and female embryos. Mechanistically, our data reveal that transcriptional upregulation of male X chromosome genes is primarily mediated by a higher RNA polymerase II initiation rate and burst amplitude across the expression domain. In contrast, burst frequency is spatially modulated in nuclei within the expression domain in response to different transcription factor concentrations to tune the transcriptional response. Together, these data show how the local and global regulation of distinct burst parameters can establish the complex transcriptional outputs underpinning developmental patterning.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the human antibody response to emerging viral pathogens is key to epidemic preparedness. As the size of the B cell response to a pathogenic-virus-protective antigen is poorly defined, we perform deep paired heavy- and light-chain sequencing in Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP)-specific memory B cells, allowing analysis of the ebolavirus-specific antibody repertoire both genetically and functionally. This approach facilitates investigation of the molecular and genetic basis for the evolution of cross-reactive antibodies by elucidating germline-encoded properties of antibodies to EBOV and identification of the overlap between antibodies in the memory B cell and serum repertoire. We identify 73 public clonotypes of EBOV, 20% of which encode antibodies with neutralization activity and capacity to protect mice in vivo. This comprehensive analysis of the public and private antibody repertoire provides insight into the molecular basis of the humoral immune response to EBOV GP, which informs the design of vaccines and improved therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
XLF/Cernunnos is a component of the ligation complex used in classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ), a major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway. We report neurodevelopmental delays and significant behavioral alterations associated with microcephaly in Xlf−/− mice. This phenotype, reminiscent of clinical and neuropathologic features in humans deficient in cNHEJ, is associated with a low level of apoptosis of neural cells and premature neurogenesis, which consists of an early shift of neural progenitors from proliferative to neurogenic divisions during brain development. We show that premature neurogenesis is related to an increase in chromatid breaks affecting mitotic spindle orientation, highlighting a direct link between asymmetric chromosome segregation and asymmetric neurogenic divisions. This study reveals thus that XLF is required for maintaining symmetric proliferative divisions of neural progenitors during brain development and shows that premature neurogenesis may play a major role in neurodevelopmental pathologies caused by NHEJ deficiency and/or genotoxic stress.

Abstract: Cnidarians are >600 million years old and are considered the sister group of Bilateria based on numerous molecular phylogenetic studies. Apart from Hydra, the genomes of all major clades of Cnidaria have been uncovered (e.g. Aurelia, Clytia, Nematostella and Acropora) and they reveal a remarkable completeness of the metazoan genomic toolbox. Of particular interest is Hydra, a model system of aging research, regenerative biology, and stem cell biology. With the knowledge gained from scRNA research, it is now possible to characterize the expression profiles of all cell types with great precision. In functional studies, our picture of the Hydra stem cell biology has changed, and we are in the process of obtaining a clear picture of the homeostasis and properties of the different stem cell populations. Even though Hydra is often compared to plant systems, the new data on germline and regeneration, but also on the dynamics and plasticity of the nervous system, show that Hydra with its simple body plan represents in a nutshell the prototype of an animal with stem cell lineages, whose properties correspond in many ways to Bilateria. This review provides an overview of the four stem cell lineages, the two epithelial lineages that constitute the ectoderm and the endoderm, as well as the multipotent somatic interstitial lineage (MPSC) and the germline stem cell lineage (GSC), also known as the interstitial cells of Hydra.

Abstract: Summary
Due to their immunosuppressive role, tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (TI-Tregs) represent attractive immuno-oncology targets. Analysis of TI vs. peripheral Tregs (P-Tregs) from 36 patients, across four malignancies, identified 17 candidate master regulators (MRs) as mechanistic determinants of TI-Treg transcriptional state. Pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening in vivo, using a chimeric hematopoietic stem cell transplant model, confirmed the essentiality of eight MRs in TI-Treg recruitment and/or retention without affecting other T cell subtypes, and targeting one of the most significant MRs (Trps1) by CRISPR KO significantly reduced ectopic tumor growth. Analysis of drugs capable of inverting TI-Treg MR activity identified low-dose gemcitabine as the top prediction. Indeed, gemcitabine treatment inhibited tumor growth in immunocompetent but not immunocompromised allografts, increased anti-PD-1 efficacy, and depleted MR-expressing TI-Tregs in vivo. This study provides key insight into Treg signaling, specifically in the context of cancer, and a generalizable strategy to systematically elucidate and target MR proteins in immunosuppressive subpopulations.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson’s disease-causing leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations lead to varying degrees of Rab GTPase hyperphosphorylation. Puzzlingly, LRRK2 GTPase-inactivating mutations—which do not affect intrinsic kinase activity—lead to higher levels of cellular Rab phosphorylation than kinase-activating mutations. Here, we investigate whether mutation-dependent differences in LRRK2 cellular localization could explain this discrepancy. We discover that blocking endosomal maturation leads to the rapid formation of mutant LRRK2+ endosomes on which LRRK2 phosphorylates substrate Rabs. LRRK2+ endosomes are maintained through positive feedback, which mutually reinforces membrane localization of LRRK2 and phosphorylated Rab substrates. Furthermore, across a panel of mutants, cells expressing GTPase-inactivating mutants form strikingly more LRRK2+ endosomes than cells expressing kinase-activating mutants, resulting in higher total cellular levels of phosphorylated Rabs. Our study suggests that the increased probability that LRRK2 GTPase-inactivating mutants are retained on intracellular membranes compared to kinase-activating mutants leads to higher substrate phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Colorectal cancer (CRC) often develops slowly from adenoma, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear, hampering the prevention or treatment of colorectal adenoma-carcinoma progression. In this study, we use in-depth quantitative proteomics combined with survival analysis, revealing that the ribosome protein U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 18 homolog (UTP18) is consistently upregulated in the progression of colorectal adenoma to carcinoma and is associated with adenoma recurrence, effective serodiagnosis, and poor prognosis of CRC. Furthermore, deSUMOylation induces the nucleocytoplasmic transport of UTP18, driving cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis via mediation of the instability of p21 mRNA. In addition, the growth and ribosome biogenesis of adenoma organoids is found to be promoted by overexpression of UTP18. Thus, UTP18 contributes to multiple roles in adenogenesis and malignancy of CRC, suggesting that it could be a potential biomarker and drug target for colorectal adenoma and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Combinatorial signaling is key to instruct context-dependent cell behaviors. During embryonic development, adult homeostasis, and disease, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) act as dimers to instruct specific cellular responses. BMP ligands can form both homodimers or heterodimers; however, obtaining direct evidence of the endogenous localization and function of each form has proven challenging. Here, we make use of precise genome editing and direct protein manipulation via protein binders to dissect the existence and functional relevance of BMP homodimers and heterodimers in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. This approach identified in situ the existence of Dpp (BMP2/4)/Gbb (BMP5/6/7/8) heterodimers. We found that Gbb is secreted in a Dpp-dependent manner in the wing imaginal disc. Dpp and Gbb form a gradient of heterodimers, whereas neither Dpp nor Gbb homodimers are evident under endogenous physiological conditions. We find that the formation of heterodimers is critical for obtaining optimal signaling and long-range BMP distribution.

Abstract: Summary
Human genetic diversity can reveal critical factors in host-pathogen interactions. This is especially useful for human-restricted pathogens like Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), the cause of typhoid fever. One key defense during bacterial infection is nutritional immunity: host cells attempt to restrict bacterial replication by denying bacteria access to key nutrients or supplying toxic metabolites. Here, a cellular genome-wide association study of intracellular replication by S. Typhi in nearly a thousand cell lines from around the world—and extensive follow-up using intracellular S. Typhi transcriptomics and manipulation of magnesium availability—demonstrates that the divalent cation channel mucolipin-2 (MCOLN2 or TRPML2) restricts S. Typhi intracellular replication through magnesium deprivation. Mg2+ currents, conducted through MCOLN2 and out of endolysosomes, were measured directly using patch-clamping of the endolysosomal membrane. Our results reveal Mg2+ limitation as a key component of nutritional immunity against S. Typhi and as a source of variable host resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) sequences can have prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic value, but decoding the specificity of TCR recognition remains challenging. Unlike DNA strands that base pair, TCRs bind to their targets with different orientations and different lengths, which complicates comparisons. We present scanning parametrized by normalized TCR length (SPAN-TCR) to analyze antigen-specific TCR CDR3 sequences and identify patterns driving TCR-pMHC specificity. Using entropic analysis, SPAN-TCR identifies 2-mer motifs that decrease the diversity (entropy) of CDR3s. These motifs are the most common patterns that can predict CDR3 composition, and we identify “essential” motifs that decrease entropy in the same CDR3 α or β chain containing the 2-mer, and “super-essential” motifs that decrease entropy in both chains. Molecular dynamics analysis further suggests that these motifs may play important roles in binding. We then employ SPAN-TCR to resolve similarities in TCR repertoires against different antigens using public databases of TCR sequences.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitination controls numerous cellular processes, and its deregulation is associated with many pathologies. The Nse1 subunit in the Smc5/6 complex contains a RING domain with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and essential functions in genome integrity. However, Nse1-dependent ubiquitin targets remain elusive. Here, we use label-free quantitative proteomics to analyze the nuclear ubiquitinome of nse1-C274A RING mutant cells. Our results show that Nse1 impacts the ubiquitination of several proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and metabolism that, importantly, extend beyond canonical functions of Smc5/6. In addition, our analysis suggests a connection between Nse1 and RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) ubiquitination. Specifically, Nse1 and the Smc5/6 complex promote ubiquitination of K408 and K410 in the clamp domain of Rpa190, a modification that induces its degradation in response to blocks in transcriptional elongation. We propose that this mechanism contributes to Smc5/6-dependent segregation of the rDNA array, the locus transcribed by RNA Pol I.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we report that a chemical cocktail (LCDM: leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF], CHIR99021, dimethinedene maleate [DiM], minocycline hydrochloride), previously developed for extended pluripotent stem cells (EPSCs) in mice and humans, enables de novo derivation and long-term culture of bovine trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). Bovine TSCs retain developmental potency to differentiate into mature trophoblast cells and exhibit transcriptomic and epigenetic (chromatin accessibility and DNA methylome) features characteristic of trophectoderm cells from early bovine embryos. The bovine TSCs established in this study will provide a model to study bovine placentation and early pregnancy failure.

Abstract: Objective
To explore the effects and mechanisms of action of the PBX1/secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) axis in endometrial carcinoma (EC).
Methods
The expression of PBX1 and SFRP4 was analyzed using bioinformatics prediction, followed by validation in EC cells using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. After transduction with overexpression vectors for PBX1 and SFRP4, migration, proliferation, and invasion of EC cells were measured, accompanied by the detection of E-cadherin, Snail, N-cadherin, Vimentin, β-catenin, GSK-3β, and C-myc expression. The association between PBX1 and SFRP4 was validated using dual luciferase reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.
Results
PBX1 and SFRP4 were downregulated in EC cells. Overexpression of PBX1 or SFRP4 resulted in weakened cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as decreased expression of Snail, N-cadherin, Vimentin, β-catenin, GSK-3β, and C-myc and increased expression of E-cadherin. PBX1 bound to the SFRP4 promoter and promoted its transcription. Knockdown of SFRP4 reversed the repression of overexpressed PBX1 in the malignant phenotypes and EMT of EC cells, and PBX1 repressed Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation by upregulating SFRP4 transcription.
Conclusion
PBX1 inhibited activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by promoting SFRP4 transcription, thereby suppressing malignant phenotypes in EC cells and the EMT process.

Abstract: Summary
The cochlea harbors two types of sound receptors, outer hair cells (OHCs) and inner hair cells (IHCs). OHCs transdifferentiate into IHCs in Insm1 mutants, and OHCs in Ikzf2-deficient mice are dysfunctional and maintain partial IHC gene expression. Insm1 potentially acts as a positive but indirect regulator of Ikzf2, considering that Insm1 is expressed earlier than Ikzf2 and primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor. However, direct evidence of this possibility is lacking. Here, we report the following results: first, Insm1 overexpression in IHCs leads to ectopic Ikzf2 expression. Second, Ikzf2 expression is repressed in Insm1-deficient OHCs, and forced expression of Ikzf2 mitigates the OHC abnormality in Insm1 mutants. Last, dual ablation of Insm1 and Ikzf2 generates a similar OHC phenotype as does Insm1 ablation alone. Collectively, our findings reveal the transcriptional cascade from Insm1 to Ikzf2, which should facilitate future investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying OHC development and regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Lymphocytes are key for immune surveillance of tumors, but our understanding of the spatial organization and physical interactions that facilitate lymphocyte anti-cancer functions is limited. We used multiplexed imaging, quantitative spatial analysis, and machine learning to create high-definition maps of lung tumors from a Kras/Trp53-mutant mouse model and human resections. Networks of interacting lymphocytes (“lymphonets”) emerged as a distinctive feature of the anti-cancer immune response. Lymphonets nucleated from small T cell clusters and incorporated B cells with increasing size. CXCR3-mediated trafficking modulated lymphonet size and number, but T cell antigen expression directed intratumoral localization. Lymphonets preferentially harbored TCF1+ PD-1+ progenitor CD8+ T cells involved in responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Upon treatment of mice with ICB or an antigen-targeted vaccine, lymphonets retained progenitor and gained cytotoxic CD8+ T cell populations, likely via progenitor differentiation. These data show that lymphonets create a spatial environment supportive of CD8+ T cell anti-tumor responses.

Abstract: Summary
The STING-mediated type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway has been shown to play critical roles in antitumor immunity. Here, we demonstrate that an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized JmjC domain-containing protein, JMJD8, inhibits STING-induced type I IFN responses to promote immune evasion and breast tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, JMJD8 competes with TBK1 for binding with STING, blocking STING-TBK1 complex formation and restricting type I IFN and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression as well as immune cell infiltration. JMJD8 knockdown improves the efficacy of chemotherapy and immune checkpoint therapy in treating both human and mouse breast cancer cell-derived implanted tumors. The clinical relevance is highlighted in that JMJD8 is highly expressed in human breast tumor samples, and its expression is inversely correlated with that of type I IFN and ISGs as well as immune cell infiltration. Overall, our study found that JMJD8 regulates type I IFN responses, and targeting JMJD8 triggers antitumor immunity.

Abstract: Background
This study aimed to investigate role of erythropoietin in atherosclerosis and explore whether underlying mechanism is associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
Methods
High-fat-diet-induced atherosclerosis model was established in apolipoprotein E knockout mice (C57BL/6 genetic background). Mice were randomly divided into the control group and the EPO group. Hematoxylin-eosin was performed for the determination of atherosclerotic lesions. The expression levels of related proteins were detected by western blot analysis.
Results
Erythropoietin significantly enhanced the incidence of hemorrhage in atherosclerotic plaques compared with the control group. The proteins’ expression signaling pathways (including PI3K, AKT, and mTOR) and angiogenesis-related proteins (VEGF, COX-2, and HIF-1α) were proved to be up-regulated by erythropoietin. Additionally, erythropoietin significantly enhanced the incidence of hemorrhage in the atherosclerotic plaques compared with the control group. The vitro experiments were conducted in macrophages at 21% O2 or 1% O2. The data showed that expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR, VEGF, COX-2, and HIF-1α related proteins increased in 1% O2 group than 21% O2 group. Moreover, compared with control group, protein expression including p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR, VEGF, COX-2, and HIF-1α was markedly increased in EPO group, decreased in inhibitors group, and similar results were observed in EPO+ inhibitors group.
Conclusion
The present study demonstrated that erythropoietin might promote angiogenesis in atherosclerotic vulnerable by activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in atherosclerotic, providing a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerotic targeted therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) causes fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most prevalent form of inherited intellectual disability. Here, we show that FMRP interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) to regulate the formation and function of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCSs), structures that are critical for mitochondrial calcium (mito-Ca2+) homeostasis. FMRP-deficient cells feature excessive ERMCS formation and ER-to-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of VDAC or other ERMCS components restored synaptic structure, function, and plasticity and rescued locomotion and cognitive deficits of the Drosophila dFmr1 mutant. Expressing FMRP C-terminal domain (FMRP-C), which confers FMRP-VDAC interaction, rescued the ERMCS formation and mito-Ca2+ homeostasis defects in FXS patient iPSC-derived neurons and locomotion and cognitive deficits in Fmr1 knockout mice. These results identify altered ERMCS formation and mito-Ca2+ homeostasis as contributors to FXS and offer potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) has emerged as one of the most conserved and reliable surface markers for the prospective identification and isolation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Prior studies have consistently demonstrated that EPCR expression enriches HSCs capable of long-term multilineage repopulation in both mouse and human across different hematopoietic tissues, including bone marrow (BM), fetal liver and ex vivo HSC expansion cultures. However, little is known about the expression profiles of EPCR in multipotent progenitor (MPP) populations located immediately downstream of HSCs in the hematopoietic hierarchy and which play a major role in sustaining lifelong blood cell production. Here, we incorporate EPCR antibody detection into a multi-parameter flow cytometric panel, which allows accurate identification of HSCs and five MPP subsets (MPP1-5) in mouse BM. Our data reveal that all MPP populations contain EPCR-expressing cells. Multipotent MPP1 and MPP5 contain higher proportion of EPCR+ cells compared to the more lineage-biased MPP2–4. Notably, high expression of EPCR enriches phenotypic HSC and MPP5, but not MPP1. Comparison of EPCR expression profiles between young and old BM reveals ageing mediated expansion of EPCR-expressing cells only in HSCs, but not in any of the MPP populations. Collectively, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of the surface expression pattern of EPCR in mouse HSC and MPP1–5 cells during normal and aged hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
To better understand how the brain allows primates to perform various sets of tasks, the ability to simultaneously record neural activity at multiple spatiotemporal scales is challenging but necessary. However, the contribution of single-unit activities (SUAs) to neurovascular activity remains to be fully understood. Here, we combine functional ultrasound imaging of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and SUA recordings in visual and fronto-medial cortices of behaving macaques. We show that SUA provides a significant estimate of the neurovascular response below the typical fMRI spatial resolution of 2mm3. Furthermore, our results also show that SUAs and CBV activities are statistically uncorrelated during the resting state but correlate during tasks. These results have important implications for interpreting functional imaging findings while one constructs inferences of SUA during resting state or tasks.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic alterations in the microenvironment significantly modulate tumor immunosensitivity, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we report that tumors depleted of fumarate hydratase (FH) exhibit inhibition of functional CD8+ T cell activation, expansion, and efficacy, with enhanced malignant proliferative capacity. Mechanistically, FH depletion in tumor cells accumulates fumarate in the tumor interstitial fluid, and increased fumarate can directly succinate ZAP70 at C96 and C102 and abrogate its activity in infiltrating CD8+ T cells, resulting in suppressed CD8+ T cell activation and anti-tumor immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, fumarate depletion by increasing FH expression strongly enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. Thus, these findings demonstrate a role for fumarate in controlling TCR signaling and suggest that fumarate accumulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a metabolic barrier to CD8+ T cell anti-tumor function. And potentially, fumarate depletion could be an important strategy for tumor immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Physical activity is associated with beneficial adaptations in human and rodent metabolism. We studied over 50 complex traits before and after exercise intervention in middle-aged men and a panel of 100 diverse strains of female mice. Candidate gene analyses in three brain regions, muscle, liver, heart, and adipose tissue of mice indicate genetic drivers of clinically relevant traits, including volitional exercise volume, muscle metabolism, adiposity, and hepatic lipids. Although ∼33% of genes differentially expressed in skeletal muscle following the exercise intervention are similar in mice and humans independent of BMI, responsiveness of adipose tissue to exercise-stimulated weight loss appears controlled by species and underlying genotype. We leveraged genetic diversity to generate prediction models of metabolic trait responsiveness to volitional activity offering a framework for advancing personalized exercise prescription. The human and mouse data are publicly available via a user-friendly Web-based application to enhance data mining and hypothesis development.

Abstract: Centrosomes are microtubule organizing centers involved in chromosome segregation, spindle orientation, cell motility and cilia formation. In recent years, they have also emerged as key modulators of asymmetric cell division. Centrosomes are composed of two centrioles that initiate duplication in S phase. The conservative nature of centriole duplication means that the two centrioles of a G1 cell are of different ages. They are also structurally different as only the older centriole carries appendages, an assembly of a subset of proteins primarily required for cilia formation. In a growing tissue, the non-motile, primary cilium acts as a mechano- and sensory organelle that influences cell behavior via modulation of signaling pathways. Here, we discuss the most recent findings about distal appendage composition and function, as well as cell cycle-specific regulation and their implications in various diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Implementation of designer receptors in engineered cells confers them to sense a particular physiological or disease state and respond with user-defined programs. To expand the therapeutic application scope of engineered cells, synthetic receptors realized through different strategies are in great demand. Here, we develop a synthetic receptor system that exerts dual control by incorporating two transmembrane helices for the signal chain. Together with a sensor-actuator device with minimal background signals and a positive loop circuit, this receptor system can sensitively respond to extracellular protein signals. We demonstrate that this synthetic receptor system can be readily adapted to respond to various inputs, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and HER2, and release customized outputs, including fluorescence signals and the therapeutic molecule IL-2. The robust signaling ability and generality of this receptor system promise it to be a useful tool in the field of cell engineering for fundamental research and translational applications.

Abstract: Summary
Most existing studies characterizing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cell responses are peptide based. This does not allow evaluation of whether tested peptides are processed and presented canonically. In this study, we use recombinant vaccinia virus (rVACV)-mediated expression of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 infection of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2-transduced B cell lines to evaluate overall T cell responses in a small cohort of recovered COVID-19 patients and uninfected donors vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. We show that rVACV expression of SARS-CoV-2 antigen can be used as an alternative to SARS-CoV-2 infection to evaluate T cell responses to naturally processed spike antigens. In addition, the rVACV system can be used to evaluate the cross-reactivity of memory T cells to variants of concern (VOCs) and to identify epitope escape mutants. Finally, our data show that both natural infection and vaccination could induce multi-functional T cell responses with overall T cell responses remaining despite the identification of escape mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Complement-dependent microglia pruning of excitatory synapses has been widely reported in physiological and pathological conditions, with few reports concerning pruning of inhibitory synapses or direct regulation of synaptic transmission by complement components. Here, we report that loss of CD59, an important endogenous inhibitor of the complement system, leads to compromised spatial memory performance. Furthermore, CD59 deficiency impairs GABAergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). This depends on regulation of GABA release triggered by Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) rather than inhibitory synaptic pruning by microglia. Notably, CD59 colocalizes with inhibitory pre-synaptic terminals and regulates SNARE complex assembly. Together, these results demonstrate that the complement regulator CD59 plays an important role in normal hippocampal function.

Abstract: Summary
Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreaks with neurological complications and deaths. We previously isolated an EV-A71 variant in the stool, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood of an immunocompromised patient who had a leucine-to-arginine substitution on the VP1 capsid protein, resulting in increased heparin sulfate binding. We show here that this mutation increases the virus’s pathogenicity in orally infected mice with depleted B cells, which mimics the patient’s immune status, and increases susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. However, a double mutant with even greater heparin sulfate affinity is not pathogenic, suggesting that increased heparin sulfate affinity may trap virions in peripheral tissues and reduce neurovirulence. This research sheds light on the increased pathogenicity of variant with heparin sulfate (HS)-binding ability in individuals with decreased B cell immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Spatiotemporal control of gene expression is important for neural development and function. Here, we show that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A/B is highly expressed in developing olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), and its knockout results in reduction in mature OSNs and aberrant targeting of OSN axons to the olfactory bulb. RNA immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that hnRNP A/B binds to a group of mRNAs that are highly related to axon projections and synapse assembly. Approximately 11% of the identified hnRNP A/B targets, including Pcdha and Ncam2, encode cell adhesion molecules. In Hnrnpab knockout mice, PCDHA and NCAM2 levels are significantly reduced at the axon terminals of OSNs. Furthermore, deletion of the hnRNP A/B-recognition motif in the 3′ UTR of Pcdha leads to impaired PCDHA expression at the OSN axon terminals. Therefore, we propose that hnRNP A/B facilitates OSN maturation and axon projection by regulating the local expression of its target genes at axon terminals.

Abstract: Summary
Alterations in the growth and maturation of chondrocytes can lead to variation in human height, including monogenic disorders of skeletal growth. We aimed to identify genes and pathways relevant to human growth by pairing human height genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with genome-wide knockout (KO) screens of growth-plate chondrocyte proliferation and maturation in vitro. We identified 145 genes that alter chondrocyte proliferation and maturation at early and/or late time points in culture, with 90% of genes validating in secondary screening. These genes are enriched in monogenic growth disorder genes and in KEGG pathways critical for skeletal growth and endochondral ossification. Further, common variants near these genes capture height heritability independent of genes computationally prioritized from GWASs. Our study emphasizes the value of functional studies in biologically relevant tissues as orthogonal datasets to refine likely causal genes from GWASs and implicates new genetic regulators of chondrocyte proliferation and maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) senses cytosolic incoming DNA and consequently activates stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (STING) to mount immune response. Here, we show nuclear cGAS could regulate VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis in an immune-independent manner. We found VEGF-A stimulation induces cGAS nuclear translocation via importin-β pathway. Moreover, nuclear cGAS subsequently regulates miR-212-5p-ARPC3 cascade to modulate VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis through affecting cytoskeletal dynamics and VEGFR2 trafficking from trans-Golgi network (TGN) to plasma membrane via a regulatory feedback loop. In contrast, cGAS deficiency remarkably impairs VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found strong association between the expression of nuclear cGAS and VEGF-A, and the malignancy and prognosis in malignant glioma, suggesting that nuclear cGAS might play important roles in human pathology. Collectively, our findings illustrated the function of cGAS in angiogenesis other than immune surveillance, which might be a potential therapeutic target for pathological angiogenesis-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Gasdermin (GSDM) is a family of proteins that execute pyroptosis in vertebrate. In invertebrate, pyroptotic GSDM was documented only in coral. Recent studies identified abundant GSDM structural homologs in Mollusca, but their functions are unclear. Herein, we report a functional GSDM from Pacific abalone Haliotis discus (HdGSDME). HdGSDME is specifically activated by abalone caspase 3 (HdCASP3) cleavage at two distinct sites, generating two active isoforms with pyroptotic and cytotoxic activities. HdGSDME possesses evolutionarily conserved residues that proved to be essential to the N-terminal pore-formation and C-terminal auto-inhibition capacities. Bacterial challenge activates the HdCASP3-HdGSDME pathway and induces pyroptosis and extracellular traps in abalone. Blockage of the HdCASP3-HdGSDME axis promotes bacterial invasion and host mortality. Collectively, this study reveals the existence of functionally conserved and yet distinct-featured GSDM in Mollusca and provides insights into the function and evolution of invertebrate GSDM.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular trafficking of secretory proteins plays key roles in animal development and physiology, but so far, tools for investigating the dynamics of membrane trafficking have been limited to cultured cells. Here, we present a system that enables acute manipulation and real-time visualization of membrane trafficking through the reversible retention of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in living multicellular organisms. By adapting the “retention using selective hooks” (RUSH) approach to Drosophila, we show that trafficking of GPI-linked, secreted, and transmembrane proteins can be controlled with high temporal precision in intact animals and cultured organs. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by analyzing the kinetics of ER exit and apical secretion and the spatiotemporal dynamics of tricellular junction assembly in epithelia of living embryos. Furthermore, we show that controllable ER retention enables tissue-specific depletion of secretory protein function. The system is broadly applicable to visualizing and manipulating membrane trafficking in diverse cell types in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The spatial boundaries of tissue response to wounding are unknown. Here, we show that in mammals, the ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is phosphorylated in response to skin injury, forming a zone of activation surrounding the region of the initial insult. This p-rpS6-zone forms within minutes after wounding and is present until healing is complete. The zone is a robust marker of healing as it encapsulates features of the healing process, including proliferation, growth, cellular senescence, and angiogenesis. A mouse model that is unable to phosphorylate rpS6 shows an initial acceleration of wound closure, but results in impaired healing, identifying p-rpS6 as a modulator but not a driver of healing. Finally, the p-rpS6-zone accurately reports on the status of dermal vasculature and the effectiveness of healing, visually dividing an otherwise homogeneous tissue into regions with distinct properties.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia arise from the yolk sac and enter the brain during early embryogenesis. Upon entry, microglia undergo in situ proliferation and eventually colonize the entire brain by the third postnatal week in mice. However, the intricacies of their developmental expansion remain unclear. Here, we characterize the proliferative dynamics of microglia during embryonic and postnatal development using complementary fate-mapping techniques. We demonstrate that the developmental colonization of the brain is facilitated by clonal expansion of highly proliferative microglial progenitors that occupy spatial niches throughout the brain. Moreover, the spatial distribution of microglia switches from a clustered to a random pattern between embryonic and late postnatal development. Interestingly, the developmental increase in microglial numbers follows the proportional growth of the brain in an allometric manner until a mosaic distribution has been established. Overall, our findings offer insight into how the competition for space may drive microglial colonization by clonal expansion during development.

Abstract: Summary
Within the cerebellar cortex, mossy fibers (MFs) excite granule cells (GCs) that excite Purkinje cells (PCs), which provide outputs to the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCNs). It is well established that PC disruption produces motor deficits such as ataxia. This could arise from either decreases in ongoing PC-DCN inhibition, increases in the variability of PC firing, or disruption of the flow of MF-evoked signals. Remarkably, it is not known whether GCs are essential for normal motor function. Here we address this issue by selectively eliminating calcium channels that mediate transmission (CaV2.1, CaV2.2, and CaV2.3) in a combinatorial manner. We observe profound motor deficits but only when all CaV2 channels are eliminated. In these mice, the baseline rate and variability of PC firing are unaltered, and locomotion-dependent increases in PC firing are eliminated. We conclude that GCs are indispensable for normal motor performance and that disruption of MF-induced signals impairs motor performance.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a homeostatic process critical for cellular survival, and its malfunction is implicated in human diseases including neurodegeneration. Loss of autophagy contributes to cytotoxicity and tissue degeneration, but the mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon remains elusive. Here, we generated autophagy-deficient (ATG5−/−) human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), from which we established a human neuronal platform to investigate how loss of autophagy affects neuronal survival. ATG5−/− neurons exhibit basal cytotoxicity accompanied by metabolic defects. Depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) due to hyperactivation of NAD-consuming enzymes is found to trigger cell death via mitochondrial depolarization in ATG5−/− neurons. Boosting intracellular NAD levels improves cell viability by restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics and proteostasis in ATG5−/− neurons. Our findings elucidate a mechanistic link between autophagy deficiency and neuronal cell death that can be targeted for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative and lysosomal storage diseases associated with autophagic defect.

Abstract: Summary
Pre-clinical studies of fragile X syndrome (FXS) have focused on neurons, with the role of glia remaining largely underexplored. We examined the astrocytic regulation of aberrant firing of FXS neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Human FXS cortical neurons, co-cultured with human FXS astrocytes, fired frequent short-duration spontaneous bursts of action potentials compared with less frequent, longer-duration bursts of control neurons co-cultured with control astrocytes. Intriguingly, bursts fired by FXS neurons co-cultured with control astrocytes are indistinguishable from control neurons. Conversely, control neurons exhibit aberrant firing in the presence of FXS astrocytes. Thus, the astrocyte genotype determines the neuronal firing phenotype. Strikingly, astrocytic-conditioned medium, and not the physical presence of astrocytes, is capable of determining the firing phenotype. The mechanistic basis of this effect indicates that the astroglial-derived protein, S100β, restores normal firing by reversing the suppression of a persistent sodium current in FXS neurons.

Abstract: Summary
At mammalian neuronal synapses, synaptic vesicle (SV) glycoproteins are essential for robust neurotransmission. Asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation is required for delivery of the major SV glycoproteins synaptophysin and SV2A to SVs. Despite this key role for N-glycosylation, the molecular compositions of SV N-glycans are largely unknown. In this study, we combined organelle isolation techniques and high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize N-glycosylation at synapses and SVs from mouse brain. Detecting over 2,500 unique glycopeptides, we found that SVs harbor a distinct population of oligomannose and highly fucosylated N-glycans. Using complementary fluorescence methods, we identify at least one highly fucosylated N-glycan enriched in SVs compared with synaptosomes. High fucosylation was characteristic of SV proteins, plasma membrane proteins, and cell adhesion molecules with key roles in synaptic function and development. Our results define the N-glycoproteome of a specialized neuronal organelle and inform timely questions in the glycobiology of synaptic pruning and neuroinflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolism is fundamental to life, but measuring metabolic reaction rates remains challenging. Here, we applied C13 fluxomics to monitor the metabolism of dietary glucose carbon in 12 tissues, 9 brain compartments, and over 1,000 metabolite isotopologues over a 4-day period. The rates of 85 reactions surrounding central carbon metabolism are determined with elementary metabolite unit (EMU) modeling. Lactate oxidation, not glycolysis, occurs at a comparable pace with the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), supporting lactate as the primary fuel. We expand the EMU framework to track and quantify metabolite flows across tissues. Specifically, multi-organ EMU simulation of uridine metabolism shows that tissue-blood exchange, not synthesis, controls nucleotide homeostasis. In contrast, isotopologue fingerprinting and kinetic analyses reveal the brown adipose tissue (BAT) having the highest palmitate synthesis activity but no apparent contribution to circulation, suggesting a tissue-autonomous synthesis-to-burn mechanism. Together, this study demonstrates the utility of dietary fluxomics for kinetic mapping in vivo and provides a rich resource for elucidating inter-organ metabolic cross talk.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of metabolism and cell growth by sensing diverse environmental signals, including amino acids. The GATOR2 complex is a key component linking amino acid signals to mTORC1. Here, we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) as a critical regulator of GATOR2. In response to amino acids, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) phosphorylates PRMT1 at S307 to promote PRMT1 translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm and lysosome, which in turn methylates WDR24, an essential component of GATOR2, to activate the mTORC1 pathway. Disruption of the CDK5-PRMT1-WDR24 axis suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. High PRMT1 protein expression is associated with elevated mTORC1 signaling in patients with HCC. Thus, our study dissects a phosphorylation- and arginine methylation-dependent regulatory mechanism of mTORC1 activation and tumor growth and provides a molecular basis to target this pathway for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Just over one decade ago, it was discovered that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) could directly respond to inflammatory cytokines by mounting a proliferative response thought to mediate the emergency production of mature blood cells. In the intervening years, we have gained mechanistic insight into this so-called activation process and have started to learn such a response may come at a cost in terms of ultimately resulting in HSC exhaustion and hematologic dysfunction. In this review article, we report the progress we have made in understanding the interplay between infection, inflammation and HSCs during the funding period of the Collaborative Research Center 873 “Maintenance and Differentiation of Stem Cells in Development and Disease”, and place this work within the context of recent output by others working within this field.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related degenerative disease primarily characterized by articular cartilage degeneration. Many inflammatory mediators are upregulated in OA patients. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways play a role in the regulation of inflammatory response. Autophagy appears to exhibit a protective mechanism, and alleviate the symptoms of OA in rats. Dysregulation of SPRED2 is associated with various diseases involving inflammatory response. However, the role of SPRED2 in OA development remains to be investigated. The present work demonstrated that SPRED2 promoted autophagy and attenuated inflammatory response in IL-1β induced osteoarthritis chondrocytes via regulating the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. SPRED2 was downregulated in human knee cartilage tissues of OA patients and in IL-1β-induced chondrocytes. SPRED2 enhanced chondrocyte proliferation and prevented cell apoptosis induced by IL-1β. SPRED2 prevented IL-1β-induced chondrocytes autophagy and inflammatory response in chondrocytes. SPRED2 inhibited the activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway and ameliorated OA injury of cartilage. Thus, SPRED2 promoted autophagy and inhibited inflammatory response by regulation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis and stimulates glucose conversion to glycogen and lipids. How these activities are coordinated to prevent hypoglycemia and hepatosteatosis is unclear. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) is rate controlling for gluconeogenesis. However, inborn human FBP1 deficiency does not cause hypoglycemia unless accompanied by fasting or starvation, which also trigger paradoxical hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis, and hyperlipidemia. Hepatocyte FBP1-ablated mice exhibit identical fasting-conditional pathologies along with AKT hyperactivation, whose inhibition reversed hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis, and hyperlipidemia but not hypoglycemia. Surprisingly, fasting-mediated AKT hyperactivation is insulin dependent. Independently of its catalytic activity, FBP1 prevents insulin hyperresponsiveness by forming a stable complex with AKT, PP2A-C, and aldolase B (ALDOB), which specifically accelerates AKT dephosphorylation. Enhanced by fasting and weakened by elevated insulin, FBP1:PP2A-C:ALDOB:AKT complex formation, which is disrupted by human FBP1 deficiency mutations or a C-terminal FBP1 truncation, prevents insulin-triggered liver pathologies and maintains lipid and glucose homeostasis. Conversely, an FBP1-derived complex disrupting peptide reverses diet-induced insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells harbor the facultative progenitor capacity in the lung alveolus to drive regeneration after lung injury. Using single-cell transcriptomics, software-guided segmentation of tissue damage, and in vivo mouse lineage tracing, we identified the grainyhead transcription factor cellular promoter 2-like 1 (Tfcp2l1) as a regulator of this regenerative process. Tfcp2l1 loss in adult AT2 cells inhibits self-renewal and enhances AT2-AT1 differentiation during tissue regeneration. Conversely, Tfcp2l1 blunts the proliferative response to inflammatory signaling during the early acute injury phase. Tfcp2l1 temporally regulates AT2 self-renewal and differentiation in alveolar regions undergoing active regeneration. Single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing reveal that Tfcp2l1 regulates cell fate dynamics across the AT2-AT1 differentiation and restricts the inflammatory program in murine AT2 cells. Organoid modeling shows that Tfcp2l1 regulation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor expression controlled these cell fate dynamics. These findings highlight the critical role Tfcp2l1 plays in balancing epithelial cell self-renewal and differentiation during alveolar regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Cross-modal plasticity is the repurposing of brain regions associated with deprived sensory inputs to improve the capacity of other sensory modalities. The functional mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity can indicate how the brain recovers from various forms of injury and how different sensory modalities are integrated. Here, we demonstrate that rewiring of the microglia-mediated local circuit synapse is crucial for cross-modal plasticity induced by visual deprivation (monocular deprivation [MD]). MD relieves the usual inhibition of functional connectivity between the somatosensory cortex and secondary lateral visual cortex (V2L). This results in enhanced excitatory responses in V2L neurons during whisker stimulation and a greater capacity for vibrissae sensory discrimination. The enhanced cross-modal response is mediated by selective removal of inhibitory synapse terminals on pyramidal neurons by the microglia in the V2L via matrix metalloproteinase 9 signaling. Our results provide insights into how cortical circuits integrate different inputs to functionally compensate for neuronal damage.

Abstract: The nucleoskeletal protein lamin is primarily responsible for the mechanical stability of the nucleus. The lamin assembly process requires the A11, A22, and ACN binding modes of the coiled-coil dimers. Although X-ray crystallography and chemical cross-linking analysis of lamin A/C have provided snapshots of A11 and ACN binding modes, the assembly mechanism of the entire filament remains to be explained. Here, we report a crystal structure of a coil 2 fragment, revealing the A22 interaction at the atomic resolution. The structure showed detailed structural features, indicating that two coiled-coil dimers of the coil 2 subdomain are separated and then re-organized into the antiparallel-four-helix bundle. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the ACN binding mode between coil 1a and the C-terminal part of coil 2 when the A11 tetramers are arranged by the A22 interactions. We propose a full assembly model of lamin A/C with the curvature around the linkers, reconciling the discrepancy between the in situ and in vitro observations. Our model accounts for the balanced elasticity and stiffness of the nuclear envelopes, which is essential in protecting the cellular nucleus from external pressure.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the axis of the human microbiome and physiological homeostasis is an essential task in managing deep-space-travel-associated health risks. The NASA-led Rodent Research 5 mission enabled an ancillary investigation of the gut microbiome, varying exposure to microgravity (flight) relative to ground controls in the context of previously shown bone mineral density (BMD) loss that was observed in these flight groups. We demonstrate elevated abundance of Lactobacillus murinus and Dorea sp. during microgravity exposure relative to ground control through whole-genome sequencing and 16S rRNA analyses. Specific functionally assigned gene clusters of L. murinus and Dorea sp. capable of producing metabolites, lactic acid, leucine/isoleucine, and glutathione are enriched. These metabolites are elevated in the microgravity-exposed host serum as shown by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomic analysis. Along with BMD loss, ELISA reveals increases in osteocalcin and reductions in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b signifying additional loss of bone homeostasis in flight.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of neurons by circadian clock genes is thought to contribute to the maintenance of neuronal functions that ultimately underlie animal behavior. However, the impact of specific circadian genes on cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling synaptic plasticity and cognitive function remains elusive. Here, we show that the expression of the circadian protein TIMELESS displays circadian rhythmicity in the mammalian hippocampus. We identify TIMELESS as a chromatin-bound protein that targets synaptic-plasticity-related genes such as phosphodiesterase 4B (Pde4b). By promoting Pde4b transcription, TIMELESS negatively regulates cAMP signaling to modulate AMPA receptor GluA1 function and influence synaptic plasticity. Conditional deletion of Timeless in the adult forebrain impairs working and contextual fear memory in mice. These cognitive phenotypes were accompanied by attenuation of hippocampal Schaffer-collateral synapse long-term potentiation. Together, these data establish a neuron-specific function of mammalian TIMELESS by defining a mechanism that regulates synaptic plasticity and cognitive function.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway after treatment with mitomycin C (MMC) is essential for preventing chromosome translocations termed “radials.” When replication forks stall at MMC-induced interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), the FA pathway is activated to orchestrate ICL unhooking and repair of the DNA break intermediates. However, in FA-deficient cells, how ICL-associated breaks are resolved in a manner that leads to radials is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that MMC-induced radials are dependent on DNA polymerase theta (POLθ)-mediated alternative end joining (A-EJ). Specifically, we show that radials observed in FANCD2−/− cells are dependent on POLθ and DNA ligase III and occur independently of classical non-homologous end joining. Furthermore, treatment of FANCD2−/− cells with POLθ inhibitors abolishes radials and leads to the accumulation of breaks co-localizing with common fragile sites. Uniformly, these observations implicate A-EJ in radial formation and provide mechanistic insights into the treatment of FA pathway-deficient cancers with POLθ inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Sex differences in complex traits are suspected to be in part due to widespread gene-by-sex interactions (GxSex), but empirical evidence has been elusive. Here, we infer the mixture of ways in which polygenic effects on physiological traits covary between males and females. We find that GxSex is pervasive but acts primarily through systematic sex differences in the magnitude of many genetic effects (“amplification”) rather than in the identity of causal variants. Amplification patterns account for sex differences in trait variance. In some cases, testosterone may mediate amplification. Finally, we develop a population-genetic test linking GxSex to contemporary natural selection and find evidence of sexually antagonistic selection on variants affecting testosterone levels. Our results suggest that amplification of polygenic effects is a common mode of GxSex that may contribute to sex differences and fuel their evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Cocaine blocks dopamine reuptake, thereby producing rewarding effects that are widely studied. However, cocaine also blocks serotonin uptake, which we show drives, in rats, individually variable aversive effects that depend on serotonin 2C receptors (5-HT2CRs) in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), a major GABAergic afferent to midbrain dopamine neurons. 5-HT2CRs produce depolarizing effects in RMTg neurons that are particularly strong in some rats, leading to aversive effects that reduce acquisition of and relapse to cocaine seeking. In contrast, 5-HT2CR signaling is largely lost after cocaine exposure in other rats, leading to reduced aversive effects and increased cocaine seeking. These results suggest a serotonergic biological marker of cocaine-seeking vulnerability that can be targeted to modulate drug seeking.

Abstract: Summary
The strength of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and asymmetric distribution of fate determinants are both implied to affect T cell differentiation. Here, we uncover asymmetric cell division (ACD) as a safeguard mechanism for memory CD8 T cell generation specifically upon strong TCR stimulation. Using live imaging approaches, we find that strong TCR stimulation induces elevated ACD rates, and subsequent single-cell-derived colonies comprise both effector and memory precursor cells. The abundance of memory precursor cells emerging from a single activated T cell positively correlates with first mitosis ACD. Accordingly, preventing ACD by inhibition of protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) during the first mitosis upon strong TCR stimulation markedly curtails the formation of memory precursor cells. Conversely, no effect of ACD on fate commitment is observed upon weak TCR stimulation. Our data provide relevant mechanistic insights into the role of ACD for CD8 T cell fate regulation upon different activation conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Upon recognizing danger signals produced by virally infected neurons, macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS) secrete multiple inflammatory cytokines to accelerate neuron apoptosis. The understanding is limited about which key effectors regulate macrophage-neuron crosstalk upon infection. We have used neurotropic-virus-infected murine models to identify that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) is upregulated in the CNS macrophages and that virally infected neurons secrete the ligand VEGF-C. When cultured with VEGF-C-containing supernatants from virally infected neurons, VEGFR-3+ macrophages suppress tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) secretion to reduce neuron apoptosis. Vegfr-3ΔLBD/ΔLBD (deletion of ligand-binding domain in myeloid cells) mice or mice treated with the VEGFR-3 kinase inhibitor exacerbate the severity of encephalitis, TNF-α production, and neuron apoptosis post Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. Activating VEGFR-3 or blocking TNF-α can reduce encephalitis and neuronal damage upon JEV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) is essential for the beneficial effects of exercise training on metabolic health. The underlying mechanisms for these effects are not fully understood, and here, we test the hypothesis that exercise training results in a more favorable iWAT structural phenotype. Using biochemical, imaging, and multi-omics analyses, we find that 11 days of wheel running in male mice causes profound iWAT remodeling including decreased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and increased vascularization and innervation. We identify adipose stem cells as one of the main contributors to training-induced ECM remodeling, show that the PRDM16 transcriptional complex is necessary for iWAT remodeling and beiging, and discover neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) as a link between PRDM16 and neuritogenesis. Moreover, we find that training causes a shift from hypertrophic to insulin-sensitive adipocyte subpopulations. Exercise training leads to remarkable adaptations to iWAT structure and cell-type composition that can confer beneficial changes in tissue metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The cortex has a disputed role in monitoring postural equilibrium and intervening in cases of major postural disturbances. Here, we investigate the patterns of neural activity in the cortex that underlie neural dynamics during unexpected perturbations. In both the primary sensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices of the rat, unique neuronal classes differentially covary their responses to distinguish different characteristics of applied postural perturbations; however, there is substantial information gain in M1, demonstrating a role for higher-order computations in motor control. A dynamical systems model of M1 activity and forces generated by the limbs reveals that these neuronal classes contribute to a low-dimensional manifold comprised of separate subspaces enabled by congruent and incongruent neural firing patterns that define different computations depending on the postural responses. These results inform how the cortex engages in postural control, directing work aiming to understand postural instability after neurological disease.

Abstract: Summary
Supporting healthy pregnancy outcomes requires a comprehensive understanding of the cellular hierarchy and underlying molecular mechanisms in the primate placenta during gestation. Here, we present a single-cell transcriptome-wide view of the cynomolgus macaque placenta throughout gestation. Bioinformatics analyses and multiple validation experiments suggested that placental trophoblast cells exhibited stage-specific differences across gestation. Interactions between trophoblast cells and decidual cells also showed gestational stage-dependent differences. The trajectories of the villous core cells indicated that placental mesenchymal cells were derived from extraembryonic mesoderm (ExE.Meso) 1, whereas placental Hofbauer cells, erythrocytes, and endothelial cells were derived from ExE.Meso2. Comparative analyses of human and macaque placentas uncovered conserved features of placentation across species, and the discrepancies of extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs) between human and macaque correlated to their differences in invasion patterns and maternal-fetal interactions. Our study provides a groundwork for elucidating the cellular basis of primate placentation.

Abstract: Summary
Angiosperms possess a life cycle with an alternation of sporophyte and gametophyte generations, which happens in plant organs like pistils. Rice pistils contain ovules and receive pollen for successful fertilization to produce grains. The cellular expression profile in rice pistils is largely unknown. Here, we show a cell census of rice pistils before fertilization through the use of droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing. The ab initio marker identification validated by in situ hybridization assists with cell-type annotation, revealing cell heterogeneity between ovule- and carpel-originated cells. A comparison of 1N (gametophyte) and 2N (sporophyte) nuclei identifies the developmental path of germ cells in ovules with typical resetting of pluripotency before the sporophyte-gametophyte transition, while trajectory analysis of carpel-originated cells suggests previously neglected features of epidermis specification and style function. These findings gain a systems-level view of cellular differentiation and development of rice pistils before flowering and lay a foundation for understanding female reproductive development in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Potent T cell responses against infections and malignancies require a rapid yet tightly regulated production of toxic effector molecules. Their production level is defined by post-transcriptional events at 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs). RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key regulators in this process. With an RNA aptamer-based capture assay, we identify >130 RBPs interacting with IFNG, TNF, and IL2 3′ UTRs in human T cells. RBP-RNA interactions show plasticity upon T cell activation. Furthermore, we uncover the intricate and time-dependent regulation of cytokine production by RBPs: whereas HuR supports early cytokine production, ZFP36L1, ATXN2L, and ZC3HAV1 dampen and shorten the production duration, each at different time points. Strikingly, even though ZFP36L1 deletion does not rescue the dysfunctional phenotype, tumor-infiltrating T cells produce more cytokines and cytotoxic molecules, resulting in superior anti-tumoral T cell responses. Our findings thus show that identifying RBP-RNA interactions reveals key modulators of T cell responses in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine-activated M2 macrophages contribute to inflammation resolution and wound healing. This study shows that IL-4-primed macrophages exhibit a stronger response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation while maintaining M2 signature gene expression. Metabolic divergence between canonical M2 and non-canonical proinflammatory-prone M2 (M2INF) macrophages occurs after the IL-4Rα/Stat6 axis. Glycolysis supports Hif-1α stabilization and proinflammatory phenotype of M2INF macrophages. Inhibiting glycolysis blunts Hif-1α accumulation and M2INF phenotype. Wdr5-dependent H3K4me3 mediates the long-lasting effect of IL-4, with Wdr5 knockdown inhibiting M2INF macrophages. Our results also show that the induction of M2INF macrophages by IL-4 intraperitoneal injection and transferring of M2INF macrophages confer a survival advantage against bacterial infection in vivo. In conclusion, our findings highlight the previously neglected non-canonical role of M2INF macrophages and broaden our understanding of IL-4-mediated physiological changes. These results have immediate implications for how Th2-skewed infections could redirect disease progression in response to pathogen infection.

Abstract: Summary
The AAA+ NSF complex is responsible for SNARE complex disassembly both before and after membrane fusion. Loss of NSF function results in pronounced developmental and degenerative defects. In a genetic screen for sensory deficits in zebrafish, we identified a mutation in nsf, I209N, that impairs hearing and balance in a dosage-dependent manner without accompanying defects in motility, myelination, and innervation. In vitro experiments demonstrate that while the I209N NSF protein recognizes SNARE complexes, the effects on disassembly are dependent upon the type of SNARE complex and I209N concentration. Higher levels of I209N protein produce a modest decrease in binary (syntaxin-SNAP-25) SNARE complex disassembly and residual ternary (syntaxin-1A-SNAP-25-synaptobrevin-2) disassembly, whereas at lower concentrations binary disassembly activity is strongly reduced and ternary disassembly activity is absent. Our study suggests that the differential effect on disassembly of SNARE complexes leads to selective effects on NSF-mediated membrane trafficking and auditory/vestibular function.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are being used in clinical trials given their proliferative potential, immunomodulatory effects, and their pro-angiogenic, anti-apoptotic, and anti-fibrotic properties. Umbilical cord tissue is an excellent source of MSCs. Iron-fortified calf serum is being used to culture MSCs as an alternative to fetal bovine serum since it is relatively inexpensive. Fetal calf serum is fortified with iron since calves are often fed a low-iron diet. However, the use of iron-fortified calf serum is still problematic since it is xenogeneic. Lately, human platelet lysate is being used for the culture of human cells. To increase its shelf life, human platelet lysate was lyophilized and used for culturing human umbilical cord tissue mesenchymal stem cells (hUCT-MSCs). This study compares the culture of hUCT-MSCs with either iron-fortified calf serum or lyophilized human platelet lysate (LHPL). Trilineage differentiation potential (for chondrogenesis, adipogenesis, or osteogenesis) was assessed and immunomodulatory properties of hUCT-MSC were studied using the Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR) to detect inhibition of the proliferation of lymphocytes. This study concludes the potency of LHPL as the best alternative to Iron-Fortified Calf Serum (IFCS) for culture expansion of hUCT-MSC. hUCT-MSC cultured with LHPL display characteristic surface markers and have the capacity for trilineage differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) mediates H3K27me3 deposition, which is thought to recruit canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) via chromodomain-containing CBX proteins to promote stable repression of developmental genes. PRC2 forms two major subcomplexes, PRC2.1 and PRC2.2, but their specific roles remain unclear. Through genetic knockout (KO) and replacement of PRC2 subcomplex-specific subunits in naïve and primed pluripotent cells, we uncover distinct roles for PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 in mediating the recruitment of different forms of cPRC1. PRC2.1 catalyzes the majority of H3K27me3 at Polycomb target genes and is sufficient to promote recruitment of CBX2/4-cPRC1 but not CBX7-cPRC1. Conversely, while PRC2.2 is poor at catalyzing H3K27me3, we find that its accessory protein JARID2 is essential for recruitment of CBX7-cPRC1 and the consequent 3D chromatin interactions at Polycomb target genes. We therefore define distinct contributions of PRC2.1- and PRC2.2-specific accessory proteins to Polycomb-mediated repression and uncover a new mechanism for cPRC1 recruitment.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming plays a crucial role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the key drivers of metabolic reprogramming underlying HCC progression remain unclear. Using a large-scale transcriptomic database and survival correlation screening, we identify thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) as a key driver. The progression of HCC is robustly mitigated by TK1 knockdown and significantly aggravated by its overexpression. Furthermore, TK1 promotes the oncogenic phenotypes of HCC not only through its enzymatic activity and production of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) but also by promoting glycolysis via binding with protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Mechanistically, TK1 directly binds PRMT1 and stabilizes it by interrupting its interactions with tripartite-motif-containing 48 (TRIM48), which inhibits its ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Subsequently, we validate the therapeutic capacity of hepatic TK1 knockdown in a chemically induced HCC mouse model. Therefore, targeting both the enzyme-dependent and -independent activity of TK1 may be therapeutically promising for HCC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal-epithelial transitions are fundamental drivers of development and disease, but how these behaviors generate epithelial structure is not well understood. Here, we show that mesenchymal-epithelial transitions promote epithelial organization in the mouse node and notochordal plate through the assembly and radial intercalation of three-dimensional rosettes. Axial mesoderm rosettes acquire junctional and apical polarity, develop a central lumen, and dynamically expand, coalesce, and radially intercalate into the surface epithelium, converting mesenchymal-epithelial transitions into higher-order tissue structure. In mouse Par3 mutants, axial mesoderm rosettes establish central tight junction polarity but fail to form an expanded apical domain and lumen. These defects are associated with altered rosette dynamics, delayed radial intercalation, and formation of a small, fragmented surface epithelial structure. These results demonstrate that three-dimensional rosette behaviors translate mesenchymal-epithelial transitions into collective radial intercalation and epithelial formation, providing a strategy for building epithelial sheets from individual self-organizing units in the mammalian embryo.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic islet cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for modeling and treating diabetes. Differences between stem-cell-derived and primary islets remain, but molecular insights to inform improvements are limited. Here, we acquire single-cell transcriptomes and accessible chromatin profiles during in vitro islet differentiation and pancreas from childhood and adult donors for comparison. We delineate major cell types, define their regulomes, and describe spatiotemporal gene regulatory relationships between transcription factors. CDX2 emerged as a regulator of enterochromaffin-like cells, which we show resemble a transient, previously unrecognized, serotonin-producing pre-β cell population in fetal pancreas, arguing against a proposed non-pancreatic origin. Furthermore, we observe insufficient activation of signal-dependent transcriptional programs during in vitro β cell maturation and identify sex hormones as drivers of β cell proliferation in childhood. Altogether, our analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of cell fate acquisition in stem-cell-derived islets and a framework for manipulating cell identities and maturity.

Abstract: Summary
Deregulated inflammation is a critical feature driving the progression of tumors harboring mutations in the liver kinase B1 (LKB1), yet the mechanisms linking LKB1 mutations to deregulated inflammation remain undefined. Here, we identify deregulated signaling by CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) as an epigenetic driver of inflammatory potential downstream of LKB1 loss. We demonstrate that LKB1 mutations sensitize both transformed and non-transformed cells to diverse inflammatory stimuli, promoting heightened cytokine and chemokine production. LKB1 loss triggers elevated CRTC2-CREB signaling downstream of the salt-inducible kinases (SIKs), increasing inflammatory gene expression in LKB1-deficient cells. Mechanistically, CRTC2 cooperates with the histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300 to deposit histone acetylation marks associated with active transcription (i.e., H3K27ac) at inflammatory gene loci, promoting cytokine expression. Together, our data reveal a previously undefined anti-inflammatory program, regulated by LKB1 and reinforced through CRTC2-dependent histone modification signaling, that links metabolic and epigenetic states to cell-intrinsic inflammatory potential.
