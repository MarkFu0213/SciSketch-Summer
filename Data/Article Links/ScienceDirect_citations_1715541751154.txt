Abstract: Summary
The NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sirt1 antagonizes p53 transcriptional activity to regulate cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. We have identified a ubiquitin-specific peptidase, USP22, one of the 11 death-from-cancer signature genes that are critical in controlling cell growth and death, as a positive regulator of Sirt1. USP22 interacts with and stabilizes Sirt1 by removing polyubiquitin chains conjugated onto Sirt1. The USP22-mediated stabilization of Sirt1 leads to decreasing levels of p53 acetylation and suppression of p53-mediated functions. In contrast, depletion of endogenous USP22 by RNA interference destabilizes Sirt1, inhibits Sirt1-mediated deacetylation of p53 and elevates p53-dependent apoptosis. Genetic deletion of the usp22 gene results in Sirt1 instability, elevated p53 transcriptional activity and early embryonic lethality in mice. Our study elucidates a molecular mechanism in suppression of cell apoptosis by stabilizing Sirt1 in response to DNA damage and reveals a critical physiological function of USP22 in mouse embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated metabolism is a hallmark of cancer cell lines, but little is known about the fate of glucose and other nutrients in tumors growing in their native microenvironment. To study tumor metabolism in vivo, we used an orthotopic mouse model of primary human glioblastoma (GBM). We infused 13C-labeled nutrients into mice bearing three independent GBM lines, each with a distinct set of mutations. All three lines displayed glycolysis, as expected for aggressive tumors. They also displayed unexpected metabolic complexity, oxidizing glucose via pyruvate dehydrogenase and the citric acid cycle, and using glucose to supply anaplerosis and other biosynthetic activities. Comparing the tumors to surrounding brain revealed obvious metabolic differences, notably the accumulation of a large glutamine pool within the tumors. Many of these same activities were conserved in cells cultured ex vivo from the tumors. Thus GBM cells utilize mitochondrial glucose oxidation during aggressive tumor growth in vivo.

Abstract: Chromaffin cells from the adrenal medulla secrete catecholamines into the blood stream as part of the fight-or-flight response. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes from the immune system release cytotoxic substances to kill antigen-presenting cells. While at first glance these two cell types do not seem to have much in common, evidence from human diseases indicates that the molecular mechanisms of exocytosis of the respective granules share many similar features. In this review we highlight the similarities and differences of individual aspects of granule maturation and release in both cell types. In addition, we discuss established and putative molecules involved in distinct steps and suggest technical approaches which might facilitate future studies in chromaffin cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

NEMO Ensures Signaling Specificity of the Pleiotropic IKKβ by Directing Its Kinase Activity toward IκBα,

Abstract: Summary
Besides activating NFκB by phosphorylating IκBs, IKKα/IKKβ kinases are also involved in regulating metabolic insulin signaling, the mTOR pathway, Wnt signaling, and autophagy. How IKKβ enzymatic activity is targeted to stimulus-specific substrates has remained unclear. We show here that NEMO, known to be essential for IKKβ activation by inflammatory stimuli, is also a specificity factor that directs IKKβ activity toward IκBα. Physical interaction and functional competition studies with mutant NEMO and IκB proteins indicate that NEMO functions as a scaffold to recruit IκBα to IKKβ. Interestingly, expression of NEMO mutants that allow for IKKβ activation by the cytokine IL-1, but fail to recruit IκBs, results in hyperphosphorylation of alternative IKKβ substrates. Furthermore IKK's function in autophagy, which is independent of NFκB, is significantly enhanced without NEMO as IκB scaffold. Our work establishes a role for scaffolds such as NEMO in determining stimulus-specific signal transduction via the pleiotropic signaling hub IKK.

Abstract: In Drosophila, broad complex, tramtrack, bric à brac (BTB)/ poxvirus and zinc finger (POZ) transcription factors are essential regulators of development. We searched the Drosophila genome for BTB/POZ-ZF domains and discovered an unknown Drosophila gene, dPLZF, which encodes an orthologue of human PLZF. We then characterized the biological function of the dPLZF via genetic interaction analysis. Ectopic expression of dPLZF in the wing induced extra vein formation during wing development in Drosophila. Genetic interactions between dPLZF and Ras or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) significantly enhanced the formation of vein cells. On the other hand, loss-of-function mutations in dPLZF resulted in a dramatic suppression of the extra and ectopic vein formation induced by elevated Ras/ERK signaling. Moreover, dPLZF activity upregulated the expression of rhomboid (rho) and spitz, which perform crucial functions in vein cell formation in the developing wing. These results indicate that dPLZF is a transcription factor controlled by the Ras/ERK signaling pathway, which is a prominent regulator of vein cell formation during wing development in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
Multipotent stem cells and their lineage-restricted progeny drive nephron formation within the developing kidney. Here, we document expression of the adult stem cell marker Lgr5 in the developing kidney and assess the stem/progenitor identity of Lgr5+ve cells via in vivo lineage tracing. The appearance and localization of Lgr5+ve cells coincided with that of the S-shaped body around embryonic day 14. Lgr5 expression remained restricted to cell clusters within developing nephrons in the cortex until postnatal day 7, when expression was permanently silenced. In vivo lineage tracing identified Lgr5 as a marker of a stem/progenitor population within nascent nephrons dedicated to generating the thick ascending limb of Henle’s loop and distal convoluted tubule. The Lgr5 surface marker and experimental models described here will be invaluable for deciphering the contribution of early nephron stem cells to developmental defects and for isolating human nephron progenitors as a prerequisite to evaluating their therapeutic potential.

Abstract: Summary
Endogenous molecules generated upon pathogen invasion or tissue damage serve as danger signals that activate host defense; however, their precise immunological role remains unclear. Tenascin-C is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is specifically induced upon injury and infection. Here, we show that its expression is required to generate an effective immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during experimental sepsis in vivo. Tenascin-C enables macrophage translation of proinflammatory cytokines upon LPS activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and suppresses the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines. It mediates posttranscriptional control of a specific subset of inflammatory mediators via induction of the microRNA miR-155. Thus, tenascin-C plays a key role in regulating the inflammatory axis during pathogenic activation of TLR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors form the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which limits cell growth in response to poor growth conditions. Through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rheb, this complex inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a key promoter of cell growth. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize TBC1D7 as a stably associated and ubiquitous third core subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. We demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 (TSC-TBC) complex is the functional complex that senses specific cellular growth conditions and possesses Rheb-GAP activity. Sequencing analyses of samples from TSC patients suggest that TBC1D7 is unlikely to represent TSC3. TBC1D7 knockdown decreases the association of TSC1 and TSC2 leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, without effects on the localization of TSC2 to the lysosome. Like the other TSC-TBC components, TBC1D7 knockdown results in increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy, and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions.

Abstract: Summary
In animal gonads, PIWI proteins and their bound 23–30 nt piRNAs guard genome integrity by the sequence specific silencing of transposons. Two branches of piRNA biogenesis, namely primary processing and ping-pong amplification, have been proposed. Despite an overall conceptual understanding of piRNA biogenesis, identity and/or function of the involved players are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate an essential role for the female sterility gene shutdown in piRNA biology. Shutdown, an evolutionarily conserved cochaperone collaborates with Hsp90 during piRNA biogenesis, potentially at the loading step of RNAs into PIWI proteins. We demonstrate that Shutdown is essential for both primary and secondary piRNA populations in Drosophila. An extension of our study to previously described piRNA pathway members revealed three distinct groups of biogenesis factors. Together with data on how PIWI proteins are wired into primary and secondary processing, we propose a unified model for piRNA biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant gliomas are the most aggressive forms of brain tumors, associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Recurrence and tumorigenesis are attributed to a subpopulation of tumor-initiating glioma stem cells (GSCs) that are intrinsically resistant to therapy. Initiation and progression of gliomas have been linked to alterations in microRNA expression. Here, we report the identification of microRNA-138 (miR-138) as a molecular signature of GSCs and demonstrate a vital role for miR-138 in promoting growth and survival of bona fide tumor-initiating cells with self-renewal potential. Sequence-specific functional inhibition of miR-138 prevents tumorsphere formation in vitro and impedes tumorigenesis in vivo. We delineate the components of the miR-138 regulatory network by loss-of-function analysis to identify specific regulators of apoptosis. Finally, the higher expression of miR-138 in GSCs compared to non-neoplastic tissue and association with tumor recurrence and survival highlights the clinical significance of miR-138 as a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for treatment of malignant gliomas.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterial cell wall is conserved in prokaryotes, stabilizing cells against osmotic stress. Beta-lactams inhibit cell-wall synthesis and induce lysis through a bulge-mediated mechanism; however, little is known about the formation dynamics and stability of these bulges. To capture processes of different timescales, we developed an imaging platform combining automated image analysis with live-cell microscopy at high time resolution. Beta-lactam killing of Escherichia coli cells proceeded through four stages: elongation, bulge formation, bulge stagnation, and lysis. Both the cell wall and outer membrane (OM) affect the observed dynamics; damaging the cell wall with different beta-lactams and compromising OM integrity cause different modes and rates of lysis. Our results show that the bulge-formation dynamics are determined by how the cell wall is perturbed. The OM plays an independent role in stabilizing the bulge once it is formed. The stabilized bulge delays lysis and allows recovery upon drug removal.

Abstract: Summary
Initiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is definitively linked to activating mutations in the KRAS oncogene. However, PDA mouse models show that mutant Kras expression early in development gives rise to a normal pancreas, with tumors forming only after a long latency or pancreatitis induction. Here, we show that oncogenic KRAS upregulates endogenous EGFR expression and activation, the latter being dependent on the EGFR ligand sheddase, ADAM17. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of EGFR or ADAM17 effectively eliminates KRAS-driven tumorigenesis in vivo. Without EGFR activity, active RAS levels are not sufficient to induce robust MEK/ERK activity, a requirement for epithelial transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular membrane fusion requires complexes of syntaxins with other SNARE proteins and regulatory Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins. In membrane fusion mediating, e.g., neurotransmitter release or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in mammals, SM proteins preferentially interact with the inactive closed, rather than the active open, conformation of syntaxin or with the assembled SNARE complex. Other membrane fusion processes such as vacuolar fusion in yeast involve like membranes carrying cis-SNARE complexes, and the role of SM protein is unknown. We investigated syntaxin-SM protein interaction in membrane fusion of Arabidopsis cytokinesis, which involves cytokinesis-specific syntaxin KNOLLE and SM protein KEULE. KEULE interacted with an open conformation of KNOLLE that complemented both knolle and keule mutants. This interaction occurred at the cell division plane and required the KNOLLE linker sequence between helix Hc and SNARE domain. Our results suggest that in cytokinesis, SM protein stabilizes the fusion-competent open form of syntaxin, thereby promoting trans-SNARE complex formation.

Abstract: Hyaluronic acid (HA) has been shown to promote angiogenesis. However, the mechanism behind this effect remains largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, the mechanism of HA-induced angiogenesis was examined. CD44 and PKCδ were shown to be necessary for induction of the receptor for HA-mediated cell motility (RHAMM), a HA-binding protein. RHAMM was necessary for HA-promoted cellular invasion and endothelial cell tube formation. Cytokine arrays showed that HA induced the expression of plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI), a downstream target of TGFβ receptor signaling. The induction of PAI-1 was dependent on CD44 and PKCδ. HA also induced an interaction between RHAMM and TGFβ receptor I, and induction of PAI-1 was dependent on RHAMM and TGFβ receptor I. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which is decreased by HA via rac1, reduced induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by HA. ERK, which interacts with RHAMM, was necessary for induction of PAI-1 by HA. Snail, a downstream target of TGFβ signaling, was also necessary for induction of PAI-1. The down regulation of PAI-1 prevented HA from enhancing endothelial cell tube formation and from inducing expression of angiogenic factors, such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MMP-2. HDAC3 also exerted reduced expression of MMP-2. In this study, we provide a novel mechanism of HA-promoted angiogenesis, which involved RHAMM-TGFβRI signaling necessary for induction of PAI-1.

Abstract: Summary
Ingested dsRNAs trigger RNA interference (RNAi) in many invertebrates, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we show that the C. elegans apical intestinal membrane protein SID-2 is required in C. elegans for the import of ingested dsRNA and that, when expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, SID-2 enables the uptake of dsRNAs. SID-2-dependent dsRNA transport requires an acidic extracellular environment and is selective for dsRNAs with at least 50 base pairs. Through structure-function analysis, we identify several SID-2 regions required for this activity, including three extracellular, positively charged histidines. Finally, we find that SID-2-dependent transport is inhibited by drugs that interfere with vesicle transport. Therefore, we propose that environmental dsRNAs are imported from the acidic intestinal lumen by SID-2 via endocytosis and are released from internalized vesicles in a secondary step mediated by the dsRNA channel SID-1. Similar multistep mechanisms may underlie the widespread observations of environmental RNAi.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons, like all cells, face the problem that tubulin forms microtubules with too many or too few protofilaments (pfs). Cells overcome this heterogeneity with the γ-tubulin ring complex, which provides a nucleation template for 13-pf microtubules. Doublecortin (DCX), a protein that stabilizes microtubules in developing neurons, also nucleates 13-pf microtubules in vitro. Using fluorescence microscopy assays, we show that the binding of DCX to microtubules is optimized for the lateral curvature of the 13-pf lattice. This sensitivity depends on a cooperative interaction wherein DCX molecules decrease the dissociation rate of their neighbors. Mutations in DCX found in patients with subcortical band heterotopia weaken these cooperative interactions. Using assays with dynamic microtubules, we discovered that DCX binds to polymerization intermediates at growing microtubule ends. These results support a mechanism for stabilizing 13-pf microtubules that allows DCX to template new 13-pf microtubules through associations with the sides of the microtubule lattice.

Abstract: The morphological characteristics and percentage of the cellular associations between gonadotrophs (LH- and FSH-secreting cells) and other cellular types were studied in pituitary pars distalis of adult male viscachas (Lagostomus maximus maximus) by double immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies to LH, FSH, PRL, GH, ACTH, TSH and S-100 protein (by folliculostellate cells; FSC), during long and short photoperiods. Bihormonal gonadotrophs were observed in ventro-medial and dorsal regions, interspersed between monohormonal gonadotrophs, and their number increased in short photoperiod. LH- and FSH-gonadotrophs were found around lactotrophs, enclosed by somatotrophs in the dorsal region, and associated with irregular corticotrophs. Gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs were associated along blood vessels and follicular structures. The cytoplasmic prolongations of FSC were in contact with both gonadotrophs. The percentage of LH–FSH, LH–ACTH, LH–FSC, FSH–LH, FSH–PRL, FSH–GH, FSH–ACTH, FSH–TSH and FSH–FSC associations decreased, whereas LH–PRL increased in short as compared to long photoperiod. The most abundant associations were LH–GH and LH–TSH during long photoperiod, but LH–GH and LH–PRL during short photoperiod. FSH–GH and FSH–PRL were the most numerous associations, and LH–FSC and FSH–FSC were the less abundant ones in both photoperiods. These results provide the morphological evidence for specific cellular associations between gonadotrophs and other cellular types of viscacha pituitary.

Abstract: Summary
In skeletal myogenesis, the transcription factor MyoD activates distinct transcriptional programs in progenitors compared to terminally differentiated cells. Using ChIP-Seq and gene expression analyses, we show that in primary myoblasts, Snail-HDAC1/2 repressive complex binds and excludes MyoD from its targets. Notably, Snail binds E box motifs that are G/C rich in their central dinucleotides, and such sites are almost exclusively associated with genes expressed during differentiation. By contrast, Snail does not bind the A/T-rich E boxes associated with MyoD targets in myoblasts. Thus, Snai1-HDAC1/2 prevent MyoD occupancy on differentiation-specific regulatory elements, and the change from Snail to MyoD binding often results in enhancer switching during differentiation. Furthermore, we show that a regulatory network involving myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), Snai1/2, miR-30a, and miR-206 acts as a molecular switch that controls entry into myogenic differentiation. Together, these results reveal a regulatory paradigm that directs distinct gene expression programs in progenitors versus terminally differentiated cells.

Diabetes can be controlled with insulin injections, but a curative approach that restores the number of insulin-producing β cells is still needed. Using a zebrafish model of diabetes, we screened ∼7,000 small molecules to identify enhancers of β cell regeneration. The compounds we identified converge on the adenosine signaling pathway and include exogenous agonists and compounds that inhibit degradation of endogenously produced adenosine. The most potent enhancer of β cell regeneration was the adenosine agonist 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), which, acting through the adenosine receptor A2aa, increased β cell proliferation and accelerated restoration of normoglycemia in zebrafish. Despite markedly stimulating β cell proliferation during regeneration, NECA had only a modest effect during development. The proliferative and glucose-lowering effect of NECA was confirmed in diabetic mice, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for adenosine in β cell regeneration. With this whole-organism screen, we identified components of the adenosine pathway that could be therapeutically targeted for the treatment of diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
The ALKF1174L mutation is associated with intrinsic and acquired resistance to crizotinib and cosegregates with MYCN in neuroblastoma. In this study, we generated a mouse model overexpressing ALKF1174L in the neural crest. Compared to ALKF1174L and MYCN alone, co-expression of these two oncogenes led to the development of neuroblastomas with earlier onset, higher penetrance, and enhanced lethality. ALKF1174L/MYCN tumors exhibited increased MYCN dosage due to ALKF1174L-induced activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways, coupled with suppression of MYCN pro-apoptotic effects. Combined treatment with the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor Torin2 overcame the resistance of ALKF1174L/MYCN tumors to crizotinib. Our findings demonstrate a pathogenic role for ALKF1174L in neuroblastomas overexpressing MYCN and suggest a strategy for improving targeted therapy for ALK-positive neuroblastoma.

Abstract: Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are the foundation of spermatogenesis throughout postnatal life in male and have the ability to transmit genetic information to the subsequent generation. In this study, we have optimized the transduction efficiency of SSCs using a lentiviral vector by considering different multiplicity of infection (MOI), duration of infection, presence or absence of feeder layer and polycationic agents. We tested MOI of 5, 10 or 20 and infection duration of 6, 9 or 12 h respectively. After infection, cells were cultured for 1 week and as a result, the number of transduced SSCs increased significantly for MOI of 5 and 10 with 6 h of infection. When the same condition (MOI of 5 with 6 hours) was applied in presence or absence of STO feeder layer and infected SSCs were cultured for 3 weeks on the STO feeder layer, a significant increase in the number of transduced cells was observed for without the feeder layer during infection. We subsequently studied the effects of polycationic agents, polybrene and dioctadecylamidoglycyl spermine (DOGS), on the transduction efficiency. Compared with the polybrene treatment, the recovery rate of the transduced SSCs was significantly higher for the DOGS treatment. Therefore, our optimization study could contribute to the enhancement of germ-line modification of SSCs using lentiviral vectors and in generation of transgenic animals.

Abstract: Summary
The expansion of repressive epigenetic marks has been implicated in heterochromatin formation during embryonic development, but the general applicability of this mechanism is unclear. Here we show that nuclear rearrangement of repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 into nonoverlapping structural layers characterizes senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) formation in human fibroblasts. However, the global landscape of these repressive marks remains unchanged upon SAHF formation, suggesting that in somatic cells, heterochromatin can be formed through the spatial repositioning of pre-existing repressively marked histones. This model is reinforced by the correlation of presenescent replication timing with both the subsequent layered structure of SAHFs and the global landscape of the repressive marks, allowing us to integrate microscopic and genomic information. Furthermore, modulation of SAHF structure does not affect the occupancy of these repressive marks, nor vice versa. These experiments reveal that high-order heterochromatin formation and epigenetic remodeling of the genome can be discrete events.

Abstract: Summary
The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a key molecule for chromatin conformational changes that promote cellular diversity, but nothing is known about its role in neurons. Here, we produced mice with a conditional knockout (cKO) of CTCF in postmitotic projection neurons, mostly in the dorsal telencephalon. The CTCF-cKO mice exhibited postnatal growth retardation and abnormal behavior and had defects in functional somatosensory mapping in the brain. In terms of gene expression, 390 transcripts were expressed at significantly different levels between CTCF-deficient and control cortex and hippocampus. In particular, the levels of 53 isoforms of the clustered protocadherin (Pcdh) genes, which are stochastically expressed in each neuron, declined markedly. Each CTCF-deficient neuron showed defects in dendritic arborization and spine density during brain development. Their excitatory postsynaptic currents showed normal amplitude but occurred with low frequency. Our results indicate that CTCF regulates functional neural development and neuronal diversity by controlling clustered Pcdh expression.

Abstract: Summary
Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is strongly correlated to a poor prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we uncovered a causative link between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and development of PVTT. Mechanistically, elevated TGF-β activity, associated with the persistent presence of HBV in the liver tissue, suppresses the expression of microRNA-34a, leading to enhanced production of chemokine CCL22, which recruits regulatory T (Treg) cells to facilitate immune escape. These findings strongly suggest that HBV infection and activity of the TGF-β-miR-34a-CCL22 axis serve as potent etiological factors to predispose HCC patients for the development of PVTT, possibly through the creation of an immune-subversive microenvironment to favor colonization of disseminated HCC cells in the portal venous system.

Abstract: Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an anti-apoptotic protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The role of BI-1 has been studied in different physiopathological models including ischemia, diabetes, liver regeneration and cancer. However, fundamental knowledge about the effects of BI-1 deletion on the proteome is lacking. To further explore this protein, we compared the levels of different proteins in bi-1-/- and bi-1+/+ mouse tissues by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS). In several bi-1-/- mice, glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75/mortalin/ PBP74/mthsp70), peroxiredoxin6 (Prx6) and fumarylaceto-acetate hydrolase (FAH) showed a pI shift that could be attributed to post-translational modifications. Selenium-binding protein 2 (SBP2) and ferritin light chain 1 levels were significantly increased. Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein-1 (PEBP-1) was dramatically decreased in bi-1-/- mice, which was confirmed by Western blotting. The phosphorylation of GRP75, Prx6 and FAH were compared between bi-1+/+ and bi-1-/- mice using liver tissue lysates. Of these three proteins, only one exhibited modified phosphorylation; Tyr phosphorylation of Prx6 was increased in bi-1-/- mice. Our protein profiling results provide fundamental knowledge about the physiopathological function of BI-1.

Abstract: Autophagy is the primary mechanism of degradation of cellular proteins and at least two functions can be attributed to this biological phenomenon: increased nutrient supply via recycling of the products of autophagy under nutrient starvation; and antimicrobial response involved in the innate immune system. Many microorganisms induce host cell autophagy and it has been proposed as a pathway by which parasites compete with the host cell for limited resources. In this report we provide evidence that the intracellular parasite Leishmania amazonensis induces autophagy in macrophages. Using western blotting, the LC3II protein, a marker of autophagosomes, was detected in cell cultures with a high infection index. Macrophages infected with L. amazonensis were examined by transmission electronic microscopy, which revealed enlarged myelin-like structures typical late autophagosome and autolysosome. Other evidence indicating autophagy was Lysotracker red dye uptake by the macrophages. Autophagy also occurs in the leishmaniasis skin lesions of BALB/c mice, detected by immunohistochemistry with anti-LC3II antibody. In this study, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA) reduced the infection index, while autophagy inductors, such as rapamycin or starvation, did not alter the infection index in cultivated macrophages, suggesting that one aspect of the role of autophagy could be the provision of nutritive support to the parasite.

Abstract: Summary
Deterioration of functional islet β-cell mass is the final step in progression to Type 2 diabetes. We previously reported that overexpression of Nkx6.1 in rat islets has the dual effects of enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and increasing β-cell replication. Here we show that Nkx6.1 strongly upregulates the prohormone VGF in rat islets and that VGF is both necessary and sufficient for Nkx6.1-mediated enhancement of GSIS. Moreover, the VGF-derived peptide TLQP-21 potentiates GSIS in rat and human islets and improves glucose tolerance in vivo. Chronic injection of TLQP-21 in prediabetic ZDF rats preserves islet mass and slows diabetes onset. TLQP-21 prevents islet cell apoptosis by a pathway similar to that used by GLP-1, but independent of the GLP-1, GIP, or VIP receptors. Unlike GLP-1, TLQP-21 does not inhibit gastric emptying or increase heart rate. We conclude that TLQP-21 is a targeted agent for enhancing islet β-cell survival and function.

Abstract: Summary
While diet-induced obesity has been exclusively attributed to increased caloric intake from fat, animals fed a high-fat diet (HFD) ad libitum (ad lib) eat frequently throughout day and night, disrupting the normal feeding cycle. To test whether obesity and metabolic diseases result from HFD or disruption of metabolic cycles, we subjected mice to either ad lib or time-restricted feeding (tRF) of a HFD for 8 hr per day. Mice under tRF consume equivalent calories from HFD as those with ad lib access yet are protected against obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation and have improved motor coordination. The tRF regimen improved CREB, mTOR, and AMPK pathway function and oscillations of the circadian clock and their target genes' expression. These changes in catabolic and anabolic pathways altered liver metabolome and improved nutrient utilization and energy expenditure. We demonstrate in mice that tRF regimen is a nonpharmacological strategy against obesity and associated diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine acetylation is a major posttranslational modification involved in a broad array of physiological functions. Here, we provide an organ-wide map of lysine acetylation sites from 16 rat tissues analyzed by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. We quantify 15,474 modification sites on 4,541 proteins and provide the data set as a web-based database. We demonstrate that lysine acetylation displays site-specific sequence motifs that diverge between cellular compartments, with a significant fraction of nuclear sites conforming to the consensus motifs G-AcK and AcK-P. Our data set reveals that the subcellular acetylation distribution is tissue-type dependent and that acetylation targets tissue-specific pathways involved in fundamental physiological processes. We compare lysine acetylation patterns for rat as well as human skeletal muscle biopsies and demonstrate its general involvement in muscle contraction. Furthermore, we illustrate that acetylation of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase serves as a cellular mechanism to switch off enzymatic activity.

Abstract: Summary
The developmental mechanisms underlying human congenital heart disease (CHD) are poorly understood. Atrial septal defects (ASDs) can result from haploinsufficiency of cardiogenic transcription factors including TBX5. We demonstrated that Tbx5 is required in the second heart field (SHF) for atrial septation in mice. Conditional Tbx5 haploinsufficiency in the SHF but not the myocardium or endocardium caused ASDs. Tbx5 SHF knockout embryos lacked atrial septum progenitors. We found that Tbx5 mutant SHF progenitors demonstrated cell-cycle progression defects and that Tbx5 regulated cell-cycle progression genes including Cdk6. Activated hedgehog (Hh) signaling rescued ASDs in Tbx5 mutant embryos, placing Tbx5 upstream or parallel to Hh in cardiac progenitors. Tbx5 regulated SHF Gas1 and Osr1 expression, supporting both pathways. These results describe a SHF Tbx5-Hh network required for atrial septation. A paradigm defining molecular requirements in SHF cardiac progenitors for cardiac septum morphogenesis has implications for the ontogeny of CHD.

Abstract: Summary
Cells continually assess their energy and nutrient state to maintain growth and survival and engage necessary homeostatic mechanisms. Cell-autonomous responses to the fed state require the surveillance of the availability of amino acids and other nutrients. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates information on nutrient and amino acid availability to support protein synthesis and cell growth. We identify the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) T1R1/T1R3 as a direct sensor of the fed state and amino acid availability. Knocking down this receptor, which is found in most tissues, reduces the ability of amino acids to signal to mTORC1. Interfering with this receptor alters localization of mTORC1, downregulates expression of pathway inhibitors, upregulates key amino acid transporters, blocks translation initiation, and induces autophagy. These findings reveal a mechanism for communicating amino acid availability through a GPCR to mTORC1 in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Cilia control homeostasis of the mammalian body by generating fluid flow. It has long been assumed that ciliary length-control mechanisms are essential for proper flow generation, because fluid flow generation is a function of ciliary length. However, the molecular mechanisms of ciliary length control in mammals remain elusive. Here, we suggest that KIF19A, a member of the kinesin superfamily, regulates ciliary length by depolymerizing microtubules at the tips of cilia. Kif19a−/− mice displayed hydrocephalus and female infertility phenotypes due to abnormally elongated cilia that cannot generate proper fluid flow. KIF19A localized to cilia tips, and recombinant KIF19A controlled the length of microtubules polymerized from axonemes in vitro. KIF19A had ATP-dependent microtubule-depolymerizing activity mainly at the plus end of microtubules. Our results indicated a molecular mechanism of ciliary length regulation in mammals, which plays an important role in the maintenance of the mammalian body.

Abstract: TIP30 (30 kDa HIV-1 TAT-interacting protein), also called HTATIP2 or CC3, is a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an angiogenesis inhibitor. TIP30 blocks nuclear import of the mRNA-binding protein HuR, and thereby promotes the cytoplasmic accumulation of HuR by binding to importin-β, which is known to facilitate the cytoplasm-to-nuclear transport of HuR. Accumulation of HuR in the cytoplasm, in turn, enhances the expression of the transcription factor p53, a tumor suppressor that plays an essential role in preserving genome stability and inhibiting cancer growth. In addition to such a post-transcriptional mechanism via which TIP30 increases the p53 level, it has been proposed that TIP30 may regulate p53 protein at the protein level by directly binding to it. In order to investigate the possibility of direct interaction between p53 and TIP30, we have used on three functional regions in p53 and examined their interactions with TIP30 using GST pull-down assay and surface plasmon resonance technique. The results show that that TIP30 binds to the DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal domain of p53.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitin chains modify a major subset of the proteome, but detection of ubiquitin signaling dynamics and localization is limited due to a lack of appropriate tools. Here, we employ ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD)-based fluorescent sensors to monitor linear and K63-linked chains in vitro and in vivo. We utilize the UBD in NEMO and ABIN (UBAN) for detection of linear chains, and RAP80 ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) and TAB2 Npl4 zinc finger (NZF) domains to detect K63 chains. Linear and K63 sensors decorated the ubiquitin coat surrounding cytosolic Salmonella during bacterial autophagy, whereas K63 sensors selectively monitored Parkin-induced mitophagy and DNA damage responses in fixed and living cells. In addition, linear and K63 sensors could be used to monitor endogenous signaling pathways, as demonstrated by their ability to differentially interfere with TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB pathway. We propose that UBD-based biosensors could serve as prototypes to track and trace other chain types and ubiquitin-like signals in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue plays an important role in storing excess nutrients and preventing ectopic lipid accumulation in other organs. Obesity leads to excess lipid storage in adipocytes, resulting in the generation of stress signals and the derangement of metabolic functions. SIRT1 is an important regulatory sensor of nutrient availability in many metabolic tissues. Here we report that SIRT1 functions in adipose tissue to protect from inflammation and obesity under normal feeding conditions, and to forestall the progression to metabolic dysfunction under dietary stress and aging. Genetic ablation of SIRT1 in adipose tissue leads to gene expression changes that highly overlap with changes induced by high-fat diet in wild-type mice, suggesting that dietary stress signals inhibit the activity of SIRT1. Indeed, we show that high-fat diet induces the cleavage of SIRT1 protein in adipose tissue by the inflammation-activated caspase-1, providing a link between dietary stress and predisposition to metabolic dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Homeobox domain-containing transcription factors are important regulators of hematopoiesis. Here, we report that increased levels of nonclustered H2.0-like homeobox (HLX) lead to loss of functional hematopoietic stem cells and formation of aberrant progenitors with unlimited serial clonogenicity and blocked differentiation. Inhibition of HLX reduces proliferation and clonogenicity of leukemia cells, overcomes the differentiation block, and leads to prolonged survival. HLX regulates a transcriptional program, including PAK1 and BTG1, that controls cellular differentiation and proliferation. HLX is overexpressed in 87% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and independently correlates with inferior overall survival (n = 601, p = 2.3 × 10−6). Our study identifies HLX as a key regulator in immature hematopoietic and leukemia cells and as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in AML.

Expression of one of these genes, Hmga2, increases coincident with satellite cell activation, and later its expression significantly declines correlating with fusion of myoblasts into myotubes. Hmga2 knockout mice exhibit impaired muscle development and reduced myoblast proliferation, while overexpression of HMGA2 promotes myoblast growth. This perturbation in proliferation can be explained by the finding that HMGA2 directly regulates the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP2. Add-back of IGF2BP2 rescues the phenotype. IGF2BP2 in turn binds to and controls the translation of a set of mRNAs, including c-myc, Sp1, and Igf1r. These data demonstrate that the HMGA2-IGF2BP2 axis functions as a key regulator of satellite cell activation and therefore skeletal muscle development.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA exosome is an essential multisubunit ribonuclease (RNase) that contributes to cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA decay and quality control. The 9-subunit exosome core (Exo9) features a prominent central channel formed by stacked asymmetric rings of six RNase PH-like proteins and three S1/KH domain proteins. Exo9 is catalytically inert but associates with Rrp44, an endoribonuclease and processive 3′→5′ exoribonuclease, and Rrp6, a distributive 3′→5′ exoribonuclease. We show that Exo9 and its central channel modulate all three yeast exosome RNase activities because channel occlusion attenuates RNA binding and RNase activities in vitro and fails to complement exosome functions in vivo. We find that Rrp6 stimulates Rrp44 RNase activities and that Rrp6 is inhibited by a mutation in the Rrp44 exoribonuclease active site in 11-subunit nuclear exosomes. These results suggest the exosome core and central channel is essential because it modulates each of the known RNase activities of the yeast RNA exosome.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic profiling has identified a subtype of high-risk B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with alteration of IKZF1, a gene expression profile similar to BCR-ABL1-positive ALL and poor outcome (Ph-like ALL). The genetic alterations that activate kinase signaling in Ph-like ALL are poorly understood. We performed transcriptome and whole genome sequencing on 15 cases of Ph-like ALL and identified rearrangements involving ABL1, JAK2, PDGFRB, CRLF2, and EPOR, activating mutations of IL7R and FLT3, and deletion of SH2B3, which encodes the JAK2-negative regulator LNK. Importantly, several of these alterations induce transformation that is attenuated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, suggesting the treatment outcome of these patients may be improved with targeted therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral tolerance to tumor antigens (Ags) is a major hurdle for antitumor immunity. Draining lymph nodes are considered the privileged sites for Ag presentation to T cells and for the onset of peripheral tolerance. Here, we show that the spleen is fundamentally important for tumor-induced tolerance. Splenectomy restores lymphocyte function and induces tumor regression when coupled with immunotherapy. Splenic CD11b+Gr-1intLy6Chi cells, mostly comprising proliferating CCR2+-inflammatory monocytes with features of myeloid progenitors, expand in the marginal zone of the spleen. Here, they alter the normal tissue cytoarchitecture and closely associate with memory CD8+ T cells, cross-presenting tumor Ags and causing their tolerization. Because of its high proliferative potential, this myeloid cell subset is also susceptible to low-dose chemotherapy, which can be exploited as an adjuvant to passive immunotherapy. CCL2 serum levels in cancer patients are directly related to the accumulation of immature myeloid cells and are predictive for overall survival in patients who develop a multipeptide response to cancer vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms through which the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment regulates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate remain incompletely understood. We examined the role of the heparin-binding growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN) in regulating HSC function in the niche. PTN−/− mice displayed significantly decreased BM HSC content and impaired hematopoietic regeneration following myelosuppression. Conversely, mice lacking protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor zeta, which is inactivated by PTN, displayed significantly increased BM HSC content. Transplant studies revealed that PTN action was not HSC autonomous, but rather was mediated by the BM microenvironment. Interestingly, PTN was differentially expressed and secreted by BM sinusoidal endothelial cells within the vascular niche. Furthermore, systemic administration of anti-PTN antibody in mice substantially impaired both the homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells to the niche and the retention of BM HSCs in the niche. PTN is a secreted component of the BM vascular niche that regulates HSC self-renewal and retention in vivo.

Abstract: Cardiomyocytes are the fundamental cells of the heart and play an important role in engineering of tissue constructs for regenerative medicine and drug discovery. Therefore, the development of culture conditions that can be used to generate functional cardiomyocytes to form cardiac tissue may be of great interest. In this study, isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured with several culture conditions in vitro and characterized for cell proliferation, myofibril organization, and cardiac functionality by assessing cell morphology, immunocytochemical staining, and timelapse confocal scanning microscopy. When cardiomyocytes were cultured in liver cell line derived conditioned medium without exogenous growth factors and cytokines, the cell proliferation increased, cell morphology was highly elongated, and subsequent myofibril organization was highly developed. These developed myofibril organization also showed high level of contractibility and synchronization, representing high functionality of cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, many of the known factors in hepatic conditioned medium, such as insulin-like growth factor II (IGFII), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), did not show similar effects as the hepatic conditioned medium, suggesting the possibility of synergistic activity of the several soluble factors or the presence of unknown factors in hepatic conditioned medium. Finally, we demonstrated that our culture system could provide a potentially powerful tool for in vitro cardiac tissue organization and cardiac function study.

Crb Apical Polarity Proteins Maintain Zebrafish Retinal Cone Mosaics via Intercellular Binding of Their Extracellular Domains,

Abstract: Summary
Cone photoreceptors are assembled by unknown mechanisms into geometrically regular mosaics in many vertebrate species. The formation and maintenance of photoreceptor mosaics are speculated to require differential cell-cell adhesion. However, the molecular basis for this theory has yet to be identified. The retina and many other tissues express Crumbs (Crb) polarity proteins. The functions of the extracellular domains of Crb proteins remain to be understood. Here we report cell-type-specific expression of the crb2a and crb2b genes at the cell membranes of photoreceptor inner segments and Müller cell apical processes in the zebrafish retina. We demonstrate that the extracellular domains of Crb2a and Crb2b mediate a cell-cell adhesion function, which plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of photoreceptor layer and cone mosaics. Because Crb proteins are expressed in many types of epithelia, the Crb-based cell-cell adhesion may underlie cellular patterning in other epithelium-derived tissues as well.

Abstract: Summary
Angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels arise from preexisting ones, is critical for embryonic development and is an integral part of many disease processes. Recent studies have provided detailed information on how angiogenic sprouts initiate, elongate, and branch, but less is known about how these processes cease. Here, we show that S1PR1, a receptor for the blood-borne bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is critical for inhibition of angiogenesis and acquisition of vascular stability. Loss of S1PR1 leads to increased endothelial cell sprouting and the formation of ectopic vessel branches. Conversely, S1PR1 signaling inhibits angiogenic sprouting and enhances cell-to-cell adhesion. This correlates with inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)-induced signaling and stabilization of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin localization at endothelial junctions. Our data suggest that S1PR1 signaling acts as a vascular-intrinsic stabilization mechanism, protecting developing blood vessels against aberrant angiogenic responses.

Abstract: In skeletal muscles from patient suffering of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and from mdx mice, the absence of the cytoskeleton protein dystrophin has been shown to be essential for maintaining a normal calcium influx. We showed that a TRPC store-dependent cation influx is increased by loss of dystrophin or a scaffolding protein α1-syntrophin, however the mechanisms of this calcium mishandling are incompletely understood. First of all, we confirmed that TRPC1 but also STIM1 and Orai1 are supporting the store-operated cation entry which is enhanced in dystrophin-deficient myotubes. Next, we demonstrated that inhibition of PLC or PKC in dystrophin-deficient myotubes restores elevated cation entry to normal levels similarly to enforced minidystrophin expression. In addition, silencing α1-syntrophin also increased cation influx in a PLC/PKC dependent pathway. We also showed that α1-syntrophin and PLCβ are part of a same protein complex reinforcing the idea of their inter-relation in calcium influx regulation. This elevated cation entry was decreased to normal levels by chelating intracellular free calcium with BAPTA-AM. Double treatments with BAPTA-AM and PLC or PKC inhibitors suggested that the elevation of cation influx by PLC/PKC pathway is dependent on cytosolic calcium. All these results demonstrate an involvement in dystrophin-deficient myotubes of a specific calcium/PKC/PLC pathway in elevation of store-operated cation influx supported by the STIM1/Orai1/TRPC1 proteins, which is normally regulated by the α1-syntrophin/dystrophin scaffold.

Abstract: Summary
LIN28 is a conserved RNA-binding protein implicated in pluripotency, reprogramming, and oncogenesis. It was previously shown to act primarily by blocking let-7 microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, but here we elucidate distinct roles of LIN28 regulation via its direct messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. Through crosslinking and immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) in human embryonic stem cells and somatic cells expressing exogenous LIN28, we have defined discrete LIN28-binding sites in a quarter of human transcripts. These sites revealed that LIN28 binds to GGAGA sequences enriched within loop structures in mRNAs, reminiscent of its interaction with let-7 miRNA precursors. Among LIN28 mRNA targets, we found evidence for LIN28 autoregulation and also direct but differing effects on the protein abundance of splicing regulators in somatic and pluripotent stem cells. Splicing-sensitive microarrays demonstrated that exogenous LIN28 expression causes widespread downstream alternative splicing changes. These findings identify important regulatory functions of LIN28 via direct mRNA interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Min-protein oscillations in Escherichia coli are characterized by the remarkable robustness with which spatial patterns dynamically adapt to variations of cell geometry. Moreover, adaption, and therefore proper cell division, is independent of temperature. These observations raise fundamental questions about the mechanisms establishing robust Min oscillations, and about the role of spatial cues, as they are at odds with present models. Here, we introduce a robust model based on experimental data, consistently explaining the mechanisms underlying pole-to-pole, striped, and circular patterns, as well as the observed temperature dependence of the oscillation period. Contrary to prior conjectures, the model predicts that MinD and cardiolipin domains are not colocalized. The transient sequestration of MinE and highly canalized transfer of MinD between polar zones are the key mechanisms underlying oscillations. MinD channeling enhances midcell localization and facilitates stripe formation, revealing the potential optimization process from which robust Min-oscillations originally arose.

Abstract: Summary
The CD95 (Fas/APO-1) death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) is essential for the initiation of CD95-mediated apoptotic and nonapoptotic responses. The CD95 DISC comprises CD95, FADD, procaspase-8, procaspase-10, and c-FLIP proteins. Procaspase-8 and procaspase-10 are activated at the DISC, leading to the formation of active caspases and apoptosis initiation. In this study we analyzed the stoichiometry of the CD95 DISC. Using quantitative western blots, mass spectrometry, and mathematical modeling, we reveal that the amount of DED proteins procaspase-8/procaspase-10 and c-FLIP at the DISC exceeds that of FADD by several-fold. Furthermore, our findings imply that procaspase-8, procaspase-10, and c-FLIP could form DED chains at the DISC, enabling the formation of dimers and efficient activation of caspase-8. Taken together, our findings provide an enhanced understanding of caspase-8 activation and initiation of apoptosis at the DISC.

Abstract: Summary
Optimal insulin secretion required to maintain glucose homeostasis is the summation of total pancreatic islet β cell mass and intrinsic secretory capacity of individual β cells, which are regulated by distinct mechanisms that could be amplified by glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1). Because of these actions of GLP-1 on islet β cells, GLP-1 has been deployed to treat diabetes. We employed SNARE protein VAMP8-null mice to demonstrate that VAMP8 mediates insulin granule recruitment to the plasma membrane, which partly accounts for GLP-1 potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. VAMP8-null mice also exhibited increased islet β cell mass from increased β cell mitosis, with β cell proliferative activity greatly amplified by GLP-1. Thus, despite the β cell exocytotic defect, VAMP8-null mice have an increased total insulin secretory capacity, which improved glucose homeostasis. We conclude that these VAMP8-mediated events partly underlie the therapeutic actions of GLP-1 on insulin secretion and β cell growth.

Abstract: Summary
Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), a cochaperone that organizes other chaperones, heat shock proteins (HSPs), was recently shown to be secreted by human ovarian cancer cells. In neuronal tissues, binding to prion protein was required for STIP1 to activate the ERK (extracellular-regulated MAP kinase) signaling pathways. However, we report that STIP1 binding to a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, ALK2 (activin A receptor, type II-like kinase 2), was necessary and sufficient to stimulate proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. The binding of STIP1 to ALK2 activated the SMAD signaling pathway, leading to transcriptional activation of ID3 (inhibitor of DNA binding 3), promoting cell proliferation. In conclusion, ovarian-cancer-tissue-secreted STIP1 stimulates cancer cell proliferation by binding to ALK2 and activating the SMAD-ID3 signaling pathways. Although animal studies are needed to confirm these mechanisms in vivo, our results may pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Certain members of the peroxiredoxin (Prx) family undergo inactivation through hyperoxidation of the catalytic cysteine to sulfinic acid during catalysis and are reactivated by sulfiredoxin; however, the physiological significance of this reversible regulatory process is unclear. We now show that PrxIII in mouse adrenal cortex is inactivated by H2O2 produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes during corticosterone production stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone. Inactivation of PrxIII triggers a sequence of events including accumulation of H2O2, activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, suppression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein synthesis, and inhibition of steroidogenesis. Interestingly, levels of inactivated PrxIII, activated p38, and sulfiredoxin display circadian oscillations. Steroidogenic tissue-specific ablation of sulfiredoxin in mice resulted in the persistent accumulation of inactive PrxIII and suppression of the adrenal circadian rhythm of corticosterone production. The coupling of CYP11B1 activity to PrxIII inactivation provides a feedback regulatory mechanism for steroidogenesis that functions independently of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Abstract: Summary
Dissecting the role of insulin in the complex regulation of triglyceride metabolism is necessary for understanding dyslipidemia and steatosis. Liver insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mice show that in the physiological context of feeding, hepatic insulin signaling is not required for the induction of mTORC1, an upstream activator of the lipogenic regulator, SREBP-1c. Feeding induces SREBP-1c mRNA in LIRKO livers, though not to the extent observed in controls. A high fructose diet also partially induces SREBP-1c and lipogenic gene expression in LIRKO livers. Insulin signaling becomes more important in the pathological context of obesity, as knockdown of the insulin receptor in ob/ob mice, a model of Type 2 diabetes, using antisense oligonucleotides, abolishes the induction of SREBP-1c and its targets by obesity and ameliorates steatosis. Thus, insulin-independent signaling pathways can partially compensate for insulin in the induction of SREBP-1c by feeding but the further induction by obesity/Type 2 diabetes is entirely dependent upon insulin.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed cell death is a gene-directed process involved in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. The most common mode of programmed cell death is apoptosis, which is characterized by a stereotypical set of biochemical and morphological hallmarks. Here we report that Escherichia coli also exhibit characteristic markers of apoptosis—including phosphatidylserine exposure, chromosome condensation, and DNA fragmentation—when faced with cell death-triggering stress, namely bactericidal antibiotic treatment. Notably, we also provide proteomic and genetic evidence for the ability of multifunctional RecA to bind peptide sequences that serve as substrates for eukaryotic caspases, and regulation of this phenotype by the protease, ClpXP, under conditions of cell death. Our findings illustrate that prokaryotic organisms possess mechanisms to dismantle and mark dying cells in response to diverse noxious stimuli and suggest that elaborate, multilayered proteolytic regulation of these features may have evolved in eukaryotes to harness and exploit their deadly potential.

Abstract: Summary
Class switch recombination (CSR) has the potential to generate genomic instability in B cells as activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which mediates this process, is known to target many sites outside Igh. Nonetheless we do not fully understand what factors influence AID targeting genome-wide. Given that errors in CSR can lead to dangerous, oncogenic chromosomal translocations it is important to identify the elements that determine which genes are at risk of being “hit” and could be involved in aberrant rearrangements. Here we have investigated the influence of nuclear organization in determining “off-target” activity and the choice of fusion partners. Our studies indicate that the vast majority of known AID-mediated Igh translocation partners are found in chromosomal domains that contact this locus during class switching. Further, these interaction domains can be used to identify other genes that are hit by AID.

Abstract: Summary
Shortening eukaryotic poly(A) tails represses mRNA translation and induces mRNA turnover. The major cytoplasmic deadenylase, the Ccr4-Not complex, is a conserved multisubunit assembly. Ccr4-Not is organized around Not1, a large scaffold protein that recruits two 3′-5′ exoribonucleases, Caf1 and Ccr4. We report structural studies showing that the N-terminal arm of yeast Not1 has a HEAT-repeat structure with domains related to the MIF4G fold. A MIF4G domain positioned centrally within the Not1 protein recognizes Caf1, which in turn binds the LRR domain of Ccr4 and tethers the Ccr4 nuclease domain. The interactions that form the nuclease core of the Ccr4-Not complex are evolutionarily conserved. Their specific disruption affects cell growth and mRNA deadenylation and decay in vivo in yeast. Thus, the N-terminal arm of Not1 forms an extended platform reminiscent of scaffolding proteins like eIF4G and CBP80, and places the two nucleases in a pivotal position within the Ccr4-Not complex.

Abstract: Summary
Cilia and flagella are involved in a variety of processes and human diseases, including ciliopathies and sterility. Their motility is often controlled by a central microtubule (MT) pair localized within the ciliary MT-based skeleton, the axoneme. We characterized the formation of the motility apparatus in detail in Drosophila spermatogenesis. We show that assembly of the central MT pair starts prior to the meiotic divisions, with nucleation of a singlet MT within the basal body of a small cilium, and that the second MT of the pair only assembles much later, upon flagella formation. BLD10/CEP135, a conserved player in centriole and flagella biogenesis, can bind and stabilize MTs and is required for the early steps of central MT pair formation. This work describes a genetically tractable system to study motile cilia formation and provides an explanation for BLD10/CEP135’s role in assembling highly stable MT-based structures, such as motile axonemes and centrioles.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease with a high proliferation rate. By integrating copy number data with transcriptional profiles and performing pathway analysis in primary DLBCLs, we identified a comprehensive set of copy number alterations (CNAs) that decreased p53 activity and perturbed cell cycle regulation. Primary tumors either had multiple complementary alterations of p53 and cell cycle components or largely lacked these lesions. DLBCLs with p53 and cell cycle pathway CNAs had decreased abundance of p53 target transcripts and increased expression of E2F target genes and the Ki67 proliferation marker. CNAs of the CDKN2A-TP53-RB-E2F axis provide a structural basis for increased proliferation in DLBCL, predict outcome with current therapy, and suggest targeted treatment approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane motility is a fundamental characteristic of all eukaryotic cells. One of the best-known examples is that of the mammalian Golgi apparatus, where constant inward movement of Golgi membranes results in its characteristic position near the centrosome. While it is clear that the minus-end-directed motor dynein is required for this process, the mechanism and regulation of dynein recruitment to Golgi membranes remains unknown. Here, we show that the Golgi protein golgin160 recruits dynein to Golgi membranes. This recruitment confers centripetal motility to membranes and is regulated by the GTPase Arf1. Further, during cell division, motor association with membranes is regulated by the dissociation of the receptor-motor complex from membranes. These results identify a cell-cycle-regulated membrane receptor for a molecular motor and suggest a mechanistic basis for achieving the dramatic changes in organelle positioning seen during cell division.

Abstract: MicroRNAs are a class of small, endogenous, non-coding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or the post-transcriptional level. Although a large number of miRNAs have been identified in many plant species, especially from model plants and crops, they remain largely unknown in peach. In this study, 110 potential miRNAs belonging to 37 families were identified using computational methods. A total of 43 potential targets were found for 21 families based on near-perfect or perfect complementarity between the plant miRNA and the target sequences. A majority of the targets were transcription factors which play important roles in peach development. qRT-PCR analysis of RNA samples prepared from different peach tissues for 25 miRNA families revealed that miRNAs were differentially expressed in different tissues. Furthermore, two target genes were experimentally verified by detection of the miRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage sites in peach using RNA ligase-mediated 5’ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE). Finally, we studied the expression pattern of the two target genes in three different tissues of peach to further understand the mechanism of the interaction between miRNAs and their target genes.

Abstract: Summary
E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b plays a crucial role in T cell activation and tolerance induction. However, the molecular mechanism by which Cbl-b inhibits T cell activation remains unclear. Here, we report that Cbl-b does not inhibit PI3K but rather suppresses TCR/CD28-induced inactivation of Pten. The elevated Akt activity in Cbl-b−/− T cells is therefore due to heightened Pten inactivation. Suppression of Pten inactivation in T cells by Cbl-b is achieved by impeding the association of Pten with Nedd4, which targets Pten K13 for K63-linked polyubiquitination. Consistent with this finding, introducing Nedd4 deficiency into Cbl-b−/− mice abrogates hyper-T cell responses caused by the loss of Cbl-b. Hence, our data demonstrate that Cbl-b inhibits T cell activation by suppressing Pten inactivation independently of its ubiquitin ligase activity.

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been introduced as one of the useful tools for gene-functional discovery in animals. However, this approach has been poorly utilized in the plant sciences. In the present study, we have exploited ICA combined with pathway enrichment analysis to address the statistical challenges associated with genome-wide analysis in plant system. To generate an Arabidopsis metabolic platform, we collected 4,373 Affymetrix ATH1 microarray datasets. Out of the 3,232 metabolic genes and transcription factors, 99.47% of these genes were identified in at least one component, indicating the coverage of most of the metabolic pathways by the components. During the metabolic pathway enrichment analysis, we found components that indicate an independent regulation between the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways. We also utilized this analysis tool to investigate some transcription factors involved in secondary cell wall biogenesis. This approach has identified remarkably more transcription factors compared to previously reported analysis tools. A website providing user-friendly searching and downloading of the entire dataset analyzed by ICA is available at http://kimjy.gnu.ac.kr/ICA.files/slide0002.htm. ICA combined with pathway enrichment analysis might provide a powerful approach for the extraction of the components responsible for a biological process of interest in plant systems.

Abstract: Retroviral integration provides us with a powerful tool to realize prolonged gene expressions that are often critical to gene therapy. However, the perturbation of gene regulations in host cells by viral genome integration can lead to detrimental effects, yielding cancer. The oncogenic potential of retroviruses is linked to the preference of retroviruses to integrate into genomic regions that are enriched in gene regulatory elements. To better navigate the double-edged sword of retroviral integration we need to understand how retroviruses select their favored genomic loci during infections. In this study I showed that in addition to host proteins that tether retroviral pre-integration complexes to specific genomic regions, the epigenetic architecture of host genome might strongly affect retroviral integration patterns. Specifically, retroviruses showed their characteristic integration preference in differentiated somatic cells. In contrast, retroviral infections of hES cells, which are known to display decondensed chromatin, produced random-like integration patterns lacking of strong preference for regulatory-element-rich genomic regions. Better identification of the cellular and viral factors that determine retroviral integration patterns will facilitate the design of retroviral vectors for safer use in gene therapy.

Abstract: Summary
How nascent polypeptides emerging from ribosomes fold into functional structures is poorly understood. Here, we monitor disulfide bond formation, protease resistance, and enzymatic activity in nascent polypeptides to show that in close proximity to the ribosome, conformational space and kinetics of folding are restricted. Folding constraints decrease incrementally with distance from the ribosome surface. Upon ribosome binding, the chaperone Trigger Factor counters folding also of longer nascent chains, to extents varying between different chain segments. Trigger Factor even binds and unfolds pre-existing folded structures, the unfolding activity being limited by the thermodynamic stability of nascent chains. Folding retardation and unfolding activities are not shared by the DnaK chaperone assisting later folding steps. These ribosome- and Trigger Factor-specific activities together constitute an efficient mechanism to prevent or even revert premature folding, effectively limiting misfolded intermediates during protein synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we have investigated the role of the Notch pathway in the generation and maintenance of KrasG12V-driven non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We demonstrate by genetic means that γ-secretase and RBPJ are essential for the formation of NSCLCs. Of importance, pharmacologic treatment of mice carrying autochthonous NSCLCs with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) blocks cancer growth. Treated carcinomas present reduced HES1 levels and reduced phosphorylated ERK without changes in phosphorylated MEK. Mechanistically, we show that HES1 directly binds to and represses the promoter of DUSP1, encoding a dual phosphatase that is active against phospho-ERK. Accordingly, GSI treatment upregulates DUSP1 and decreases phospho-ERK. These data provide proof of the in vivo therapeutic potential of GSIs in primary NSCLCs.

Abstract: Summary
Macroautophagy is essential to cell survival during starvation and proceeds by the growth of a double-membraned phagophore, which engulfs cytosol and other substrates. The synthesis and recognition of the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, PI(3)P, is essential for autophagy. The key autophagic PI(3)P sensors, which are conserved from yeast to humans, belong to the PROPPIN family. Here we report the crystal structure of the yeast PROPPIN Hsv2. The structure consists of a seven-bladed β-propeller and, unexpectedly, contains two pseudo-equivalent PI(3)P binding sites on blades 5 and 6. These two sites both contribute to membrane binding in vitro and are collectively required for full autophagic function in yeast. These sites function in concert with membrane binding by a hydrophobic loop in blade 6, explaining the specificity of the PROPPINs for membrane-bound PI(3)P. These observations thus provide a structural and mechanistic framework for one of the conserved central molecular recognition events in autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
The continuously growing mouse incisor serves as a valuable model to study stem cell regulation during organ renewal. Epithelial stem cells are localized in the proximal end of the incisor in the labial cervical loop. Here, we show that the transcription factor Sox2 is a specific marker for these stem cells. Sox2+ cells became restricted to the labial cervical loop during tooth morphogenesis, and they contributed to the renewal of enamel-producing ameloblasts as well as all other epithelial cell lineages of the tooth. The early progeny of Sox2-positive stem cells transiently expressed the Wnt inhibitor Sfrp5. Sox2 expression was regulated by the tooth initiation marker FGF8 and specific miRNAs, suggesting a fine-tuning to maintain homeostasis of the dental epithelium. The identification of Sox2 as a marker for the dental epithelial stem cells will facilitate further studies on their lineage segregation and differentiation during tooth renewal.

Abstract: Summary
Recognition of the proper start codon on mRNAs is essential for protein synthesis, which requires scanning and involves eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) eIF1, eIF1A, eIF2, and eIF5. The carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) of eIF5 stimulates 43S preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly; however, its precise role in scanning and start codon selection has remained unknown. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we identified the binding sites of eIF1 and eIF2β on eIF5-CTD and found that they partially overlapped. Mutating select eIF5 residues in the common interface specifically disrupts interaction with both factors. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that these eIF5-CTD mutations impair start codon recognition and impede eIF1 release from the PIC by abrogating eIF5-CTD binding to eIF2β. This study provides mechanistic insight into the role of eIF5-CTD's dynamic interplay with eIF1 and eIF2β in switching PICs from an open to a closed state at start codons.

Abstract: Multidrug resistance is the phenomenon by which, after exposure to a single chemotherapeutic agent, cancer cells evade the agent’s cytotoxic effects as well as become resistant to several classes of diverse drugs. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a family of transporter proteins that contribute to drug resistance via an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a prominent ABC superfamily protein encoded by the mdr gene which has the ability to mediate the cellular extrusion of xenobiotics and anticancer drugs from tumor cells. Exclusively expressed P-gp cells from the human colon cancer HCT15/DOX line showed resistance to doxorubicin while parental HCT15 cells treated with doxorubicin displayed typical signs of apoptosis. In order to verify the hypothesis that expression of MDR is controlled in part, by protein kinase C (PKC), expression patterns of different PKC isoforms were examined in both cell lines. Of the PKC isoforms evaluated, the membrane translocation and expression levels of PKCα were strikingly increased in HCT15/ DOX cells. PKCα reversed doxorubicin-induced apoptosis through the scavenging of ROS as well as inhibition of PARP cleavage. In addition, inhibition of PKCα with Go6976, a specific inhibitor of classical PKC, led to reduced MDR expression and increased doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Knockdown of PKCα by siRNA diminished the protective effects of PKCα for doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. These results suggested that over-expression and activity of PKCα is closely associated with the regulation of the MDR phenotype in human colon cancer HCT15 cells and provided insight into a new strategy for inhibiting doxorubicin resistance in human cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Secreted signaling molecules typically float in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or freely diffuse away from the signaling cell, suggesting that a signal should be sensed equally by all neighboring cells. However, we demonstrate that Spitz (Spi)-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is spatially biased to selectively determine the induction of a single bract cell on the proximal side of each mechanosensory organ on the Drosophila leg. Dynamic and oriented cellular protrusions emanating from the socket cell, the source of Spi, robustly favor the Spi/EGFR signaling response in a particular cell among equally competent neighbors. We propose that these protrusive structures enhance signaling by increasing contact between the signaling and responding cells. The planar polarized direction of the protrusions determines the direction of the signaling outcome. This asymmetric cell signaling serves as a developmental mechanism to generate spatially patterned cell fates.

Abstract: This study reports the complete chloroplast (cp) DNA sequence of Eleutherococcus senticosus (GenBank: JN 637765), an endangered endemic species. The genome is 156,768 bp in length, and contains a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions of 25,930 bp each, a large single copy (LSC) region of 86,755 bp and a small single copy (SSC) region of 18,153 bp. The structural organization, gene and intron contents, gene order, AT content, codon usage, and transcription units of the E. senticosus chloroplast genome are similar to that of typical land plant cp DNA. We aligned and analyzed the sequences of 86 coding genes, 19 introns and 113 intergenic spacers (IGS) in three different taxonomic hierarchies; Eleutherococcus vs. Panax, Eleutherococcus vs. Daucus, and Eleutherococcus vs. Nicotiana. The distribution of indels, the number of polymorphic sites and nucleotide diversity indicate that positional constraint is more important than functional constraint for the evolution of cp genome sequences in Asterids. For example, the intron sequences in the LSC region exhibited base substitution rates 5-11-times higher than that of the IR regions, while the intron sequences in the SSC region evolved 7-14-times faster than those in the IR region. Furthermore, the Ka/Ks ratio of the gene coding sequences supports a stronger evolutionary constraint in the IR region than in the LSC or SSC regions. Therefore, our data suggest that selective sweeps by base collection mechanisms more frequently eliminate polymorphisms in the IR region than in other regions. Chloroplast genome regions that have high levels of base substitutions also show higher incidences of indels. Thirty-five simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were identified in the Eleutherococcus chloroplast genome. Of these, 27 are homopolymers, while six are di-polymers and two are tri-polymers. In addition to the SSR loci, we also identified 18 medium size repeat units ranging from 22 to 79 bp, 11 of which are distributed in the IGS or intron regions. These medium size repeats may contribute to developing a cp genome-specific gene introduction vector because the region may use for specific recombination sites.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that Notch signaling not only regulates the number of early differentiating neurons, but also maintains proliferating neural precursors in the neural tube. Although it is well known that Notch signaling is closely related to the differentiation of adult neural stem cells, none of transgenic zebrafish provides a tool to figure out the relationship between Notch signaling and the differentiation of neural precursors. The goal of this study was to characterize Her4-positive cells by comparing the expression of a fluorescent Her4 reporter in Tg[her4-dRFP] animals with a GFAP reporter in Tg[gfap-GFP] adult zebrafish. BrdU incorporation indicated that dRFP-positive cells were proliferating and a double labeling assay revealed that a significant fraction of the Her4-dRFP positive population was also GFAP-GFP positive. Our observations suggest that a reporter line with Notch-dependent gene expression can provide a tool to examine proliferating neural precursors and/or neuronal/glial precursors in the development of the adult nervous system to examine the model in which Notch signaling maintains proliferating neural precursors in the neural tube.

Abstract: Expression of non-inactivating Kv3.1/Kv3.2 potassium channels determines fast-spiking phenotype of many types of neurones including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs); furthermore Kv3 channels regulate neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals. In the present study we investigated how inhibition of Kv3 channel by low TEA concentrations modifies firing properties and Ca2+ influx in the rat RGCs. Experiments were performed on the whole-mount retinal preparations from 4 to 6 weeks old Wistar rats using simultaneous whole cell patch clamp and intracellular Ca2+ measurements in combination with single-cell RT-PCR. In response to 500-ms depolarization step the RGCs demonstrated fast firing tonic behaviour with a mean frequency of spiking 61±5Hz (n=28). All of the tonic cells tested (n=9) expressed specific mRNA for either Kv3.1 or Kv3.2 or for both channels. Bath applications of TEA (250μM, 500μM and 1mM) modified firing patterns dose-dependently as follows: firing frequency was decreased, mean action potential (AP) half-width increased and mean amplitude of after hyperpolarization was reduced. The amplitude of the Ca2+ signals induced by the cells firing was linearly dependent on number of APs with a mean slope of 7.3±0.9nM per one AP (n=8). APs widening by TEA increased the slope of the amplitude vs. AP number plots in a dose-dependent manner: 250μM of TEA increased the mean slope value to 9.5±1.2nM/AP, 500μM to 12.4±2.4nM/AP and 1mM to 13.2±2.9nM/AP (n=6). All these parameters, as well as the cells firing properties, were significantly different from controls and from each other except between 500μM and 1mM. This is consistent with the pharmacological properties of Kv3.1/Kv3.2 channels: the TEA IC50 is in the range 150–300μM with almost complete block at 1mM. This suggests that Kv3.1/Kv3.2 channels underlie the fast firing of the rat RGCs and provide at a given firing frequency 1.8-fold restriction Ca2+ influx, thus protecting the cells from its cytotoxic action.

Abstract: In this paper we document an increased expression of S100A6, a calcium binding protein of the S100 family, and its co-localization with β-catenin in colorectal cancer tissues and in metastatic, SW620, versus non-metastatic, SW480, human colorectal cancer cell lines. Moreover, we show up-regulation of the S100A6 protein level in non-metastatic SW480 cells due to overexpression of β-catenin as well as the activation of the S100A6 gene promoter upon cell transfection with β-catenin and the TCF-Lef1 transcription factor. Since we found a high level of S100A6 in metastatic SW620 cells we searched for its interacting partners in the protein extract prepared from these cells. Using several methods we found that S100A6 interacts with lamin A/C, a protein known to be implicated in colon carcinogenesis. Our results reveal a novel and important network of relations and interactions between proteins potentially involved in colorectal cancer development and progression.

Abstract: Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a major Ca2+ influx pathway in most non-excitable cell types and Orai1 was recently identified as an essential pore-subunit of SOCE channels. Here we investigate the physiological role of Orai1 in bone homeostasis using Orai1-deficient mice (Orai1−/−). Orai1−/− mice developed osteopenia with decreased bone mineral density and trabecular bone volume. To identify the nature and origin of the bone defect, bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts from Orai1−/− mice were examined. Orai1-mediated SOCE was completely abolished in Orai1−/− osteoclast precursor cells and osteoclastogenesis in vitro from Orai1−/− mice was impaired due to a defect in cell fusion of pre-osteoclasts. Also, resorption activity in vitro was comparable but the size of pits formed by Orai1−/− osteoclasts was smaller. We next assessed the role of Orai1 in osteoblast differentiation and function by using a pre-osteoblast cell line, as well as primary osteoblasts from wild-type and Orai1−/− mice. SOCE in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblastic cells was inactivated by lentiviral overexpression of a pore-dead Orai1 mutant. Lack of SOCE in MC3T3-E1 had no effect on alkaline phosphatase staining and expression but substantially inhibited mineralized nodule formation. Consistent with this finding, Orai1-mediated SOCE was markedly reduced in Orai1−/− osteoblast precursor cells and osteoblastogenesis in vitro from Orai1−/− stromal cells showed impaired mineral deposition but no change in differentiation. This indicates that Orai1 is involved in the function but not in the differentiation of osteoblasts. Together, these results suggest that Orai1 plays a critical role in bone homeostasis by regulating both osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) regulate normal development and homeostasis and drive disease progression in many forms of cancer. Both proteins signal by binding to receptor tyrosine kinases and heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans on target cell surfaces. Basic residues comprising the primary HS binding sites on HGF and VEGF provide similar surface charge distributions without underlying structural similarity. Combining three acidic amino acid substitutions in these sites in the HGF isoform NK1 or the VEGF isoform VEGF165 transformed each into potent, selective competitive antagonists of their respective normal and oncogenic signaling pathways. Our findings illustrate the importance of HS in growth factor driven cancer progression and reveal an efficient strategy for therapeutic antagonist development.

Abstract: Summary
Cell competition is a mechanism that eliminates slow dividing cells from a growing population. It is believed that the genes wasp, psr, and draper are active in the cells that win the competition (“winner cells”) and that they are essential in the winner cells for the induction of apoptosis and for the elimination of the “loser cells.” Here, we show that lack of those genes in winner cells appears to be dispensable for cell-competition-induced apoptosis and during dmyc-induced supercompetition. Moreover, winner clones do not need those genes in order to preserve their growth advantage. Finally, we find that most of the clearance of the apoptotic debris is not performed by winners but by recruited hemocytes, which are required for the removal of the apoptotic corpses at the very end. Therefore, engulfment is a consequence—not a cause—of loser cells' death.

Abstract: Summary
The proto-oncogene MYCN is mis-expressed in various types of human brain tumors. To clarify how developmental and regional differences influence transformation, we transduced wild-type or mutationally stabilized murine N-mycT58A into neural stem cells (NSCs) from perinatal murine cerebellum, brain stem, and forebrain. Transplantation of N-mycWT NSCs was insufficient for tumor formation. N-mycT58A cerebellar and brain stem NSCs generated medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors, whereas forebrain NSCs developed diffuse glioma. Expression analyses distinguished tumors generated from these different regions, with tumors from embryonic versus postnatal cerebellar NSCs demonstrating Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) dependence and SHH independence, respectively. These differences were regulated in part by the transcription factor SOX9, activated in the SHH subclass of human medulloblastoma. Our results demonstrate context-dependent transformation of NSCs in response to a common oncogenic signal.

Abstract: Summary
Treatment of tuberculosis, like other infectious diseases, is increasingly hindered by the emergence of drug resistance. Drug discovery efforts would be facilitated by facile screening tools that incorporate the complexities of human disease. Mycobacterium marinum-infected zebrafish larvae recapitulate key aspects of tuberculosis pathogenesis and drug treatment. Here, we develop a model for rapid in vivo drug screening using fluorescence-based methods for serial quantitative assessment of drug efficacy and toxicity. We provide proof-of-concept that both traditional bacterial-targeting antitubercular drugs and newly identified host-targeting drugs would be discovered through the use of this model. We demonstrate the model’s utility for the identification of synergistic combinations of antibacterial drugs and demonstrate synergy between bacterial- and host-targeting compounds. Thus, the platform can be used to identify new antibacterial agents and entirely new classes of drugs that thwart infection by targeting host pathways. The methods developed here should be widely applicable to small-molecule screens for other infectious and noninfectious diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Many critical protein kinases rely on the Hsp90 chaperone machinery for stability and function. After initially forming a ternary complex with kinase client and the cochaperone p50Cdc37, Hsp90 proceeds through a cycle of conformational changes facilitated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. Progression through the chaperone cycle requires release of p50Cdc37 and recruitment of the ATPase activating cochaperone AHA1, but the molecular regulation of this complex process at the cellular level is poorly understood. We demonstrate that a series of tyrosine phosphorylation events, involving both p50Cdc37 and Hsp90, are minimally sufficient to provide directionality to the chaperone cycle. p50Cdc37 phosphorylation on Y4 and Y298 disrupts client-p50Cdc37 association, while Hsp90 phosphorylation on Y197 dissociates p50Cdc37 from Hsp90. Hsp90 phosphorylation on Y313 promotes recruitment of AHA1, which stimulates Hsp90 ATPase activity, furthering the chaperoning process. Finally, at completion of the chaperone cycle, Hsp90 Y627 phosphorylation induces dissociation of the client and remaining cochaperones.

Abstract: Summary
Cilia have evolved hugely diverse structures and functions to participate in a wide variety of developmental and physiological processes. Ciliary specialization requires differences in gene expression, but few transcription factors are known to regulate this, and their molecular function is unclear. Here, we show that the Drosophila Forkhead box (Fox) gene, fd3F, is required for specialization of the mechanosensory cilium of chordotonal (Ch) neurons. fd3F regulates genes for Ch-specific axonemal dyneins and TRPV ion channels, which are required for sensory transduction, and retrograde transport genes, which are required to differentiate their distinct motile and sensory ciliary zones. fd3F is reminiscent of vertebrate Foxj1, a motile cilia regulator, but fd3F regulates motility genes as part of a broader sensory regulation program. Fd3F cooperates with the pan-ciliary transcription factor, Rfx, to regulate its targets directly. This illuminates pathways involved in ciliary specialization and the molecular mechanism of transcription factors that regulate them.

Abstract: Summary
Although inactivation of the PTEN gene has been implicated in the development of resistance to the HER2 targeting antibody trastuzumab, the mechanisms mediating this resistance remain elusive. We generated trastuzumab resistant cells by knocking down PTEN expression in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines and demonstrate that development of trastuzumab resistance in these cells is mediated by activation of an IL6 inflammatory feedback loop leading to expansion of the cancer stem cell (CSC) population. Long term trastuzumab treatment generates highly enriched CSCs which display an EMT phenotype secreting over 100-fold more IL6 than parental cells. An IL6 receptor antibody interrupted this inflammatory feedback loop reducing the cancer stem cell population resulting in decreased tumor growth and metastasis in mouse xenographs. These studies demonstrate that trastuzumab resistance may be mediated by an IL6 inflammatory loop and suggest that blocking this loop may provide alternative strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin stimulates glucose uptake through the membrane translocation of GLUT4 and GLUT1. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) enhances insulin sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that insulin stimulates GLUT4 and GLUT1 translocation, and glucose uptake, by activating the signaling pathway involving nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), a calcium mobilizer, in adipocytes. We also demonstrate that PPARγ mediates insulin sensitization by enhancing NAADP production through upregulation of CD38, the only enzyme identified for NAADP synthesis. Insulin produced NAADP by both CD38-dependent and -independent pathways, whereas PPARγ produced NAADP by CD38-dependent pathway. Blocking the NAADP signaling pathway abrogated both insulin-stimulated and PPARγ-induced GLUT4 and GLUT1 translocation, thereby inhibiting glucose uptake. CD38 knockout partially inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. However, CD38 knockout completely blocked PPARγ-induced glucose uptake in adipocytes and PPARγ-mediated amelioration of glucose tolerance in diabetic mice. These results demonstrated that the NAADP signaling pathway is a critical molecular target for PPARγ-mediated insulin sensitization.

Overexpression of Arabidopsis Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein Gene AtTCTP Enhances Drought Tolerance with Rapid ABA-Induced Stomatal Closure,

Abstract: Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), also termed P23 in human, belongs to a family of calcium- and tubulin-binding proteins, and it is generally regarded as a growth-regulating protein. Recently, Arabidopsis TCTP (AtTCTP) has been reported to function as an important growth regulator in plants. On the other hand, plant TCTP has been suggested to be involved in abiotic stress signaling such as aluminum, salt, and water deficit by a number of microarray or proteomic analyses. In this study, the biological functions of AtTCTP were investigated by using transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtTCTP. Interestingly, AtTCTP overexpression enhanced drought tolerance in plants. The expression analysis showed that AtTCTP was expressed in guard cells as well as in actively growing tissues. Physiological studies of the overexpression lines showed increased ABA- and calcium-induced stomatal closure ratios and faster stomatal closing responses to ABA. Furthermore, in vitro protein-protein interaction analysis confirmed the interaction between AtTCTP and microtubules, and microtubule cosedimentation assays revealed that the microtubule binding of AtTCTP increased after calcium treatment. These results demonstrate that the overexpression of AtTCTP confers drought tolerance to plants by rapid ABA-mediated stomatal closure via the interaction with microtubules in which calcium binding enhances the interaction. Collectively, the present results suggest that the plant TCTP has molecular properties similar to animal TCTPs, such as tubulin- and calcium-binding, and that it functions in ABA-mediated stomatal movement, in addition to regulating the growth of plants.

Abstract: Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels triggers the release of neurotransmitters at presynaptic terminals. Some sensory receptor cells in the peripheral auditory and visual systems have specialized synapses that express an electron-dense organelle called a synaptic ribbon. Like conventional synapses, ribbon synapses exhibit SNARE-mediated exocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and short-term plasticity. However, unlike non-ribbon synapses, voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel opening at ribbon synapses triggers a form of multiquantal release that can be highly synchronous. Furthermore, ribbon synapses appear to be specialized for fast and high throughput exocytosis controlled by graded membrane potential changes. Here we will discuss some of the basic aspects of synaptic transmission at different types of ribbon synapses, and we will emphasize recent evidence that auditory and retinal ribbon synapses have marked differences. This will lead us to suggest that ribbon synapses are specialized for particular operating ranges and frequencies of stimulation. We propose that different types of ribbon synapses transfer diverse rates of sensory information by expressing a particular repertoire of critical components, and by placing them at precise and strategic locations, so that a continuous supply of primed vesicles and Ca2+ influx leads to fast, accurate, and ongoing exocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to target-cell damage in inflammatory and iron-overload diseases. Little is known about iron transport regulation during inflammatory attack. Through a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we show that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β induces divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) expression correlating with increased β cell iron content and ROS production. Iron chelation and siRNA and genetic knockdown of DMT1 expression reduce cytokine-induced ROS formation and cell death. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the absence of cytokines in Dmt1 knockout islets is defective, highlighting a physiological role of iron and ROS in the regulation of insulin secretion. Dmt1 knockout mice are protected against multiple low-dose streptozotocin and high-fat diet-induced glucose intolerance, models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Thus, β cells become prone to ROS-mediated inflammatory damage via aberrant cellular iron metabolism, a finding with potential general cellular implications.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) and Ras and Rho family small GTPases are key regulators of cell polarization, motility, and chemotaxis. They influence each other's activities by direct and indirect feedback processes that are only partially understood. Here, we show that 21 small GTPase homologs activate PI3K. Using a microscopy-based binding assay, we show that K-Ras, H-Ras, and five homologous Ras family small GTPases function upstream of PI3K by directly binding the PI3K catalytic subunit, p110. In contrast, several Rho family small GTPases activated PI3K by an indirect cooperative positive feedback that required a combination of Rac, CDC42, and RhoG small GTPase activities. Thus, a distributed network of Ras and Rho family small GTPases induces and reinforces PI3K activity, explaining past challenges to elucidate the specific relevance of different small GTPases in regulating PI3K and controlling cell polarization and chemotaxis.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced activation of Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) plays crucial roles in oxidative stress-mediated cell death through the activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. However, the regulatory mechanism of ASK1 in the oxidative stress response remains to be elucidated. Here, we identified the kelch repeat protein, Slim, as an activator of ASK1 through a Drosophila misexpression screen. We also performed a proteomics screen and revealed that Kelch domain containing 10 (KLHDC10), a mammalian ortholog of Slim, interacted with Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), which has been shown to inactivate ASK1 in response to ROS. KLHDC10 bound to the phosphatase domain of PP5 and suppressed its phosphatase activity. Moreover, KLHDC10 was required for H2O2-induced sustained activation of ASK1 and cell death in Neuro2A cells. These findings suggest that Slim/KLHDC10 is an activator of ASK1, contributing to oxidative stress-induced cell death through the suppression of PP5.

Abstract: The transcription factor ATAF2, one of the plant specific NAC family genes, is known as repressor of pathogenesis-related genes and responsive to the diverse defense-related hormones, pathogen infection, and wounding stress. Furthermore, it is important to consider that tryptophandependant IAA biosynthesis pathway can be activated by wounding and pathogen. We found that ATAF2pro::GUS reporter was induced upon indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) treatments. And ataf2 mutant showed reduced sensitivity to IAN whereas 35S::ATAF2 plants showed hyper-sensitivity to IAN. IAN biosynthesis required nitrilase involved in the conversion of IAN to an auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We found that the NIT2 gene was repressed in ataf2 knockout plants. Expression of both ATAF2 and NIT2 genes was induced by IAN treatment. Transgenic plants overexpressing ATAF2 showed up-regulated NIT2 expression. ATAF2 activated promoter of the NIT2 gene in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that NIT2 promoter region from position -117 to -82 contains an ATAF2 binding site where an imperfect palindrome sequence was critical to the protein-DNA interaction. These findings indicate that ATAF2 regulates NIT2 gene expression via NIT2 promoter binding.

Abstract: Summary
Planarians grow and regenerate organs by coordinating proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells with remodeling of postmitotic tissues. Understanding how these processes are orchestrated requires characterizing cell-type-specific gene expression programs and their regulation during regeneration and homeostasis. To this end, we analyzed the expression profile of planarian intestinal phagocytes, cells responsible for digestion and nutrient storage/distribution. Utilizing RNA interference, we identified cytoskeletal regulators required for intestinal branching morphogenesis and a modulator of bioactive sphingolipid metabolism, ceramide synthase, required for the production of functional phagocytes. Additionally, we found that a gut-enriched homeobox transcription factor, nkx-2.2, is required for somatic stem cell proliferation, suggesting a niche-like role for phagocytes. Identification of evolutionarily conserved regulators of intestinal branching, differentiation, and stem cell dynamics demonstrates the utility of the planarian digestive system as a model for elucidating the mechanisms controlling postembryonic organogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
We show that R-Ras, a small GTPase of the Ras family, is essential for the establishment of mature, functional blood vessels in tumors. The genetic disruption of R-Ras severely impaired the maturation processes of tumor vessels in mice. Conversely, the gain of function of R-Ras improved vessel structure and blood perfusion and blocked plasma leakage by enhanced endothelial barrier function and pericyte association with nascent blood vessels. Thus, R-Ras promotes normalization of the tumor vasculature. These findings identify R-Ras as a critical regulator of vessel integrity and function during tumor vascularization.

Abstract: Summary
Establishment of germline sexual identity is critical for production of male and female germline stem cells, as well as sperm versus eggs. Here we identify PHD Finger Protein 7 (PHF7) as an important factor for male germline sexual identity in Drosophila. PHF7 exhibits male-specific expression in early germ cells, germline stem cells, and spermatogonia. It is important for germline stem cell maintenance and gametogenesis in males, whereas ectopic expression in female germ cells ablates the germline. Strikingly, expression of PHF7 promotes spermatogenesis in XX germ cells when they are present in a male soma. PHF7 homologs are also specifically expressed in the mammalian testis, and human PHF7 rescues Drosophila Phf7 mutants. PHF7 associates with chromatin, and both the human and fly proteins bind histone H3 N-terminal tails with a preference for dimethyl lysine 4 (H3K4me2). We propose that PHF7 acts as a conserved epigenetic “reader” that activates the male germline sexual program.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular resolution three-dimensional (3D) visualization of defined, fluorescently labeled long-range neuronal networks in the uncut adult mouse brain has been elusive. Here, a virus-based strategy is described that allowed fluorescent labeling of centrifugally projecting neuronal populations in the ventral forebrain and their directly, monosynaptically connected bulbar interneurons upon a single stereotaxic injection into select neuronal populations. Implementation of improved tissue clearing combined with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy permitted imaging of the resulting connectivity maps in a single whole-brain scan. Subsequent 3D reconstructions revealed the exact distribution of the diverse neuronal ensembles monosynaptically connected with distinct bulbar interneuron populations. Moreover, rehydratation of brains after light-sheet fluorescence imaging enabled the immunohistochemical identification of synaptically connected neurons. Thus, this study describes a method for identifying monosynaptic connectivity maps from distinct, virally labeled neuronal populations that helps in better understanding of information flow in neural systems.

Abstract: The Golgi apparatus is thought to play a role in calcium homeostasis in plant cells. However, the calcium dynamics in this organelle is unknown in plants. To monitor the [Ca2+]Golgi in vivo, we obtained and analyzed Arabidopsis thaliana plants that express aequorin in the Golgi. Our results show that free [Ca2+] levels in the Golgi are higher than in the cytosol (0.70μM vs. 0.05μM, respectively). Stimuli such as cold shock, mechanical stimulation and hyperosmotic stress, led to a transient increase in cytosolic calcium; however, no instant change in the [Ca2+]Golgi concentration was detected. Nevertheless, a delayed increase in the [Ca2+]Golgi up to 2–3μM was observed. Cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin inhibited the stimuli-induced [Ca2+]Golgi increase, suggesting that [Ca2+]Golgi levels are dependent upon the activity of Ca2+-ATPases. Treatment of these plants with the synthetic auxin analog, 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D), produced a slow decrease of free calcium in the organelle. Our results indicate that the plant Golgi apparatus is not involved in the generation of cytosolic calcium transients and exhibits its own dynamics modulated in part by the activity of Ca2+ pumps and hormones.

Abstract: Summary
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an aggressive skeletal muscle-lineage tumor composed of malignant myoblasts that fail to exit the cell cycle and are blocked from fusing into syncytial muscle. Rhabdomyosarcoma includes two histolopathologic subtypes: alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, driven by the fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1, and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), which is genetically heterogeneous. Here, we show that adipocyte-restricted activation of Sonic hedgehog signaling through expression of a constitutively active Smoothened allele in mice gives rise to aggressive skeletal muscle tumors that display the histologic and molecular characteristics of human ERMS with high penetrance. Our findings suggest that adipocyte progenitors can be a cell of origin for Sonic hedgehog-driven ERMS, showing that RMS can originate from nonskeletal muscle precursors.

Abstract: Summary
Skp1-Cul1-Fbox (SCF) E3 ligases are activated by ligation to the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8, which is reversed by the deneddylating Cop9 signalosome (CSN). However, CSN also promotes SCF substrate turnover through unknown mechanisms. Through biochemical and electron microscopy analyses, we determined molecular models of CSN complexes with SCFSkp2/Cks1 and SCFFbw7 and found that CSN occludes both SCF functional sites—the catalytic Rbx1-Cul1 C-terminal domain and the substrate receptor. Indeed, CSN binding prevents SCF interactions with E2 enzymes and a ubiquitination substrate, and it inhibits SCF-catalyzed ubiquitin chain formation independent of deneddylation. Importantly, CSN prevents neddylation of the bound cullin, unless binding of a ubiquitination substrate triggers SCF dissociation and neddylation. Taken together, the results provide a model for how reciprocal regulation sensitizes CSN to the SCF assembly state and inhibits a catalytically competent SCF until a ubiquitination substrate drives its own degradation by displacing CSN, thereby promoting cullin neddylation and substrate ubiquitination.

Abstract: Summary
Protein mistranslation causes growth arrest in bacteria, mitochondrial dysfunction in yeast, and neurodegeneration in mammals. It remains poorly understood how mistranslated proteins cause such cellular defects. Here we demonstrate that streptomycin, a bactericidal aminoglycoside that increases ribosomal mistranslation, induces transient protein aggregation in wild-type Escherichia coli. We further determined the aggregated proteome using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. To identify genes that reduce cellular mistranslation toxicity, we selected from an overexpression library protein products that increased resistance against streptomycin and kanamycin. The selected proteins were significantly enriched in members of the oxidation-reduction pathway. Overexpressing one of these proteins, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit F (a protein defending bacteria against hydrogen peroxide), but not its inactive mutant suppressed aggregated protein formation upon streptomycin treatment and increased aminoglycoside resistance. This work provides in-depth analyses of an aggregated proteome caused by streptomycin and suggests that cellular defense against hydrogen peroxide lowers the toxicity of mistranslation.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin-proteasome system is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis. However, proteasome dysregulation in chronic diseases is poorly understood. Through genome-wide cell-based screening using 5,500 cDNAs, a signaling pathway leading to NFκB activation was selected as an inhibitor of 26S proteasome. TNF-α increased S5b (HGNC symbol PSMD5; hereafter S5b/PSMD5) expression via NFκB, and the surplus S5b/PSMD5 directly inhibited 26S proteasome assembly and activity. Downregulation of S5b/PSMD5 abolished TNF-α-induced proteasome inhibition. TNF-α enhanced the interaction of S5b/PSMD5 with S7/PSMC2 in nonproteasome complexes, and interference of this interaction rescued TNF-α-induced proteasome inhibition. Transgenic mice expressing S5b/PSMD5 exhibited a reduced life span and premature onset of aging-related phenotypes, including reduced proteasome activity in their tissues. Conversely, S5b/PSMD5 deficiency in Drosophila melanogaster ameliorated the tau rough eye phenotype, enhanced proteasome activity, and extended the life span of tau flies. These results reveal the critical role of S5b/PSMD5 in negative regulation of proteasome by TNF-α/NFκB and provide insights into proteasome inhibition in human disease.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation, is repressed in certain cell types in hypoxia. However, hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α) can act as a proliferation-promoting factor in some biological settings. This paradoxical situation led us to study whether HIF2α has a specific effect on mTORC1 regulation. Here we show that activation of the HIF2α pathway increases mTORC1 activity by upregulating expression of the amino acid carrier SLC7A5. At the molecular level we also show that HIF2α binds to the Slc7a5 proximal promoter. Our findings identify a link between the oxygen-sensing HIF2α pathway and mTORC1 regulation, revealing the molecular basis of the tumor-promoting properties of HIF2α in von Hippel-Lindau-deficient cells. We also describe relevant physiological scenarios, including those that occur in liver and lung tissue, wherein HIF2α or low-oxygen tension drive mTORC1 activity and SLC7A5 expression.

IFT25 Links the Signal-Dependent Movement of Hedgehog Components to Intraflagellar Transport,

Abstract: Summary
The intraflagellar transport (IFT) system is required for building primary cilia, sensory organelles that cells use to respond to their environment. IFT particles are composed of about 20 proteins, and these proteins are highly conserved across ciliated species. IFT25, however, is absent from some ciliated organisms, suggesting that it may have a unique role distinct from ciliogenesis. Here, we generate an Ift25 null mouse and show that IFT25 is not required for ciliary assembly but is required for proper Hedgehog signaling, which in mammals occurs within cilia. Mutant mice die at birth with multiple phenotypes, indicative of Hedgehog signaling dysfunction. Cilia lacking IFT25 have defects in the signal-dependent transport of multiple Hedgehog components including Patched-1, Smoothened, and Gli2, and fail to activate the pathway upon stimulation. Thus, IFT function is not restricted to building cilia where signaling occurs, but also plays a separable role in signal transduction events.

Abstract: Summary
During endochondral ossification, small, immature chondrocytes enlarge to form hypertrophic chondrocytes, which express collagen X. In this work, we demonstrate that FoxA factors are induced during chondrogenesis, bind to conserved binding sites in the collagen X enhancer, and can promote the expression of a collagen X-luciferase reporter in both chondrocytes and fibroblasts. In addition, we demonstrate by both gain- and loss-of-function analyses that FoxA factors play a crucial role in driving the expression of both endogenous collagen X and other hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific genes. Mice engineered to lack expression of both FoxA2 and FoxA3 in their chondrocytes display defects in chondrocyte hypertrophy, alkaline phosphatase expression, and mineralization in their sternebrae and, in addition, exhibit postnatal dwarfism that is coupled to significantly decreased expression of both collagen X and MMP13 in their growth plates. Our findings indicate that FoxA family members are crucial regulators of the hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation program.
