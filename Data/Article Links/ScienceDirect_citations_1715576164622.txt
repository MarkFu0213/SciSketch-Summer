Abstract: Introduction
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoid proliferations occurring after solid organ or bone marrow transplantation. The primary aims of our study were to characterize cumulative incidence of PTLDs, clinical and pathological features according to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status and survival.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study on adult and pediatric patients, from January 2001 to December 2017. The cumulative incidence of PTLD was calculated by analyzing all the patients transplanted at our hospital, based on the database of the Organ Donation and Ablation Authority of Argentina (INCUCAI). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot the survival.
Results
Fifty-eight cases of biopsy-confirmed PTLD were identified and 12 cases of clinical data were incomplete and these patients were excluded. The median age at the time of the PTLD diagnosis was 17.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 9 - 57). The median interval between transplant and PTLD diagnosis was 39 months (IQR 9 - 113). The most commonly transplanted organ was the liver (24 cases, 52.2%), followed by kidney (20 cases, 43.5%). The Epstein-Barr encoding region in situ hybridization (EBER ISH) was positive in 29 (69.8%) of the 43 evaluable biopsies. The PTLD cumulative incidence was 1.84% (95%CI 1.77 - 1.91) for solid organ and 0.84% (95%CI 0.48 - 1.2) for bone marrow transplant patients. The overall survival rate at 5 years was 0.77 (95%CI 0.61 - 0.87). Subgroups by the EBV EBER status, transplant type, PTLD subtype and age group (adult vs. pediatric) showed no statistically significant association with the overall survival.
Conclusion
The PTLD incidence was similar to that of previous series and the EBER did not appear as a relevant factor in our patient survival.

Abstract: Introduction
Immune dysfunction and thrombocytopenia are common features in liver cirrhosis. Platelet transfusion is the most widely used therapeutic approach for thrombocytopenia when indicated. The transfused platelets are prone to lesions during their storage that empower their interaction with the recipient leucocyte. These interactions modulate the host immune response. The impact of platelet transfusion on the immune system in cirrhotic patients is little understood. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of platelet transfusion on neutrophil function in cirrhotic patients.
Methods
This prospective cohort study was implemented on 30 cirrhotic patients receiving platelet transfusion and 30 healthy individuals as a control group. EDTA blood samples were collected from cirrhotic patients before and after an elective platelet transfusion. Flowcytometric analysis of neutrophil functions (CD11b expression and PCN formation) was performed.
Results
There was a significant increase in expression of CD11b on neutrophils and Frequency of platelet-complexed neutrophils (PCN) in patients with cirrhosis compared with controls. Platelet transfusion increased level of CD11b and the frequency of PCN even more. There was a significant positive correlation between change in PCN Frequency pefore and after transfusion and the change in expression of CD11b among cirrhotic patients.
Conclusions
Elective platelet transfusion appears to increase level of PCN in cirrhotic patients, moreover, exacerbate the expression of activation marker CD11b on both neutrophils and PCN. More research and studies are needed to corroborate our preliminary findings.

Abstract: The presence of dislocation is a significant impediment to enhancing the quality of quasi-single crystalline silicon cast by seed-assisted directional solidification. A novel approach was proposed to reduce dislocations in G7 166-type silicon ingots, especially in the region of seed crystal seams, by reserving seed crystal gaps during loading. We calculated that the seed crystal's linear thermal expansion after heating from 298.15 to 1683.15 K was 0.9 mm. However, in consideration of the actual deviation in seed processing and measurement, we increased the gap between seeds to 1.2 mm to prevent compressive stress on all 49 seed crystals. The actual residual seed gap measured after ingot casting was approximately 0.325 mm, which is relatively close to the calculated value. It was discovered that the average defect ratio in the silicon blocks decreased from 26.95% (without gaps) to 6.79% (with 1.2 mm seed gaps) for the proposed method. This indicates that a portion of the dislocation source was reduced by reducing compressive stress caused by linear expansion between adjacent unmelted seeds. The average conversion efficiency of the solar cells prepared using the gapless seed method for p-type polycrystalline cells is 22.03%, whereas the novel approach resulted in an average cell efficiency of 22.22%, featuring a higher proportion of high-efficiency sections.

Abstract: The stability of perovskite solar cells must be evaluated under realistic outdoor conditions, such as light–dark cycles, because their reversible performance changes under such conditions. Therefore, in this study, we performed light–dark cycle analysis of lead halide perovskite solar cells under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation to evaluate their metastability and UV degradation. The power drop under UV irradiation was recovered after storing the cells in dark because of ion-migration effects. Furthermore, the energy yield during 6 h of UV irradiation reduced slightly during the light–dark cycles, similar to the reduction in energy yield observed under a white-light-light-emitting diode. This change in energy yield indicates that the power drop observed after 6 h of UV irradiation cannot be attributed to UV-induced degradation of the perovskite used in this study. Our findings show that light–dark cycle analyses are effective for distinguishing between metastability and UV-induced material degradation.

Abstract: Cigarette smoke (CS) represents one of the most relevant environmental risk factors for several chronic pathologies. Tissue damage caused by CS exposure is mediated, at least in part, by oxidative stress induced by its toxic and pro-oxidant components. Evidence demonstrates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by various cell types exposed to CS extract (CSE) are characterized by altered biochemical cargo and gained pathological properties. In the present study, we evaluated the content of oxidized proteins and phospholipid fatty acid profiles of EVs released by human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells treated with CSE. This specific molecular characterization has hitherto not been performed. After confirmation that CSE reduces viability of BEAS-2B cells and elevates intracellular ROS levels, in a dose-dependent manner, we demonstrated that 24 h exposure at 1% CSE, a concentration that only slight modifies cell viability but increases ROS levels, was able to increase carbonylated protein levels in cells and released EVs. The release of oxidatively modified proteins via EVs might represent a mechanism used by cells to remove toxic proteins in order to avoid their intracellular overloading. Moreover, 1% CSE induced only few changes in the fatty acid asset in BEAS-2B cell membrane phospholipids, whereas several rearrangements were observed in EVs released by CSE-treated cells. The impact of changes in acyl chain composition of CSE-EVs accounted for the increased saturation levels of phospholipids, a membrane parameter that might influence EV stability, uptake and, at least in part, EV-mediated biological effects. The present in vitro study adds new information concerning the biochemical composition of CSE-related EVs, useful to predict their biological effects on target cells. Furthermore, the information regarding the presence of oxidized proteins and the specific membrane features of CSE-related EVs can be useful to define the utilization of circulating EVs as marker for diagnosing of CS-induced lung damage and/or CS-related diseases.

Abstract: As an upgraded version of passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) solar cells, the performance of tunnel oxide passivating contacts (TOPCon) solar cells is very dependent on the silicon oxide layer and poly-Si layer. We found that different crystallization rates or doping of germanium, carbon and other elements in poly-Si can change the band gap of poly-Si, which has an impact on the efficiency (Eff) of TOPCon solar cells. Therefore, the appropriate band gap is particularly important. At the same time, the internal defect of poly-Si also have great influence on the performance of solar cells. The simulated band diagram, charge carrier concentration and recombination rate were used to deeply explore the defect in poly-Si and the influence of poly-Si with different band gap on the performance of TOPCon solar cells.

Abstract: Summary
Electrothermal actuators have attracted widespread interest owing to the potential in soft robotics, whereas the lower actuated voltage and higher thermal conductivity remain main challenges to enhance their electrothermal actuating performance. Here, we propose a one-step magnetically induced sedimentation method for fabricating self-stratifying PDMS/CI/LM (polydimethylsiloxane/carbonyl iron/liquid metal) film to improve the deficiencies. Ideally, the thermal conductivity of the hybrid film is increased by 2.3 times than pure PDMS film. Under low voltage (<3.5 V) stimulation, the hybrid film-based actuator can produce a maximum temperature of 120°C and bending curvature of 1.68 cm−1. Moreover, the special structure of the hybrid film can be further assembled to be a pressure/magnetic biresponsive sensor, which also can be applied as the “on-off” controller. Finally, the bionic frog tongue and portable tactile-activated gripper are fabricated, demonstrating that the developed electrothermal actuator possesses wide application potential in intelligent devices and bionic robots.

Abstract: The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is a reliable and efficient means of converting solar energy into electricity. The challenges brought about by the unpredictable nature of solar energy can be effectively mitigated by utilizing latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) technology, specifically by implementing heat source pretreatment. This paper investigates the thermal storage properties of a rotating triplex-tube LHTES unit under different sinusoidal fluctuating heat sources. A transient numerical model is built to analyze the effects of sinusoidal wall temperature amplitude and angular velocity on the melting characteristics of the unit, including melting time, heat storage rate, and temperature response. The design is further analyzed using the Taguchi method. The results show that the angular velocity of the sinusoidal wall temperature has a greater effect on the average heat storage rate and melting time than the amplitude. When the amplitude is set to 10 and the angular velocity to 0.02, the melting time is decreased by 8.7%, while the average heat absorption rate and average temperature response increase by 10.21% and 12.27%, respectively. Additionally, the sensible and total heat energy absorption increase by 2.23% and 0.62%, compared to the initial heat source condition. Furthermore, the heat transfer is enhanced through the introduction of Al2O3 nanoparticles at varying percentages. The unit heat storage rate improves significantly with an increasing percentage of nanoparticles. Specifically, when 2.5% and 5% Al2O3 nanoparticles are added, the melting time of the unit is reduced by 3.77% and 15.07%, respectively, while the average heat absorption rate increases by 2.43% and 10.39%.

Abstract: Thermochromic smart windows possess great application potential in terms of building energy conservation. Herein, a novel smart window is designed by combining thermochromic poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) and polypyrrole (Ppy). The photothermal conversion effect of Ppy could effectively accelerate the phase transition of PNIPAm. The Ppy could provide extra heat for PNIPAm hydrogel, the phase transition time of PNIPAm/Ppy would be reduced to 3 min(12 min for pure PNIPAm hydrogel). The smart window exhibits excellent solar modulation efficiency(53.7 %). Different concentrations of KCl could regulate phase transition temperature of PNIPAm between 20 and 32 °C. Under irradiation of simulated light for 20 min, the water temperature of test tube covered by PNIPAm/Ppy smart window is 3.5 °C lower than that of blank glass. Moreover, T-ECD based on PNIPAm/Ppy could reduce phase transition time to 90 s. The electrochromic property of Ppy could endow T-ECD with more colours, and The T-ECD exhibits high solar modulation efficiency(63.0 %) which could decline transmittance to 0.2 %. PNIPAm/Ppy composite hydrogel provides new ideas for the design of thermochromic smart windows and thermo-electrochromic dual-response devices.

Abstract: Commercial silicon heterojunction photovoltaic modules, known as amorphous-silicon-based heterojunction with intrinsic thin-film layer (HIT) modules, show average degradation after 10 years in the field. HIT modules weathered outdoors in Colorado and Florida display mostly uniform decreases in intensity when mapped with photoluminescence (PL) imaging compared to a control module. Flash-table-based current-voltage curves show that degradation is dominated by voltage loss. Samples are cored from each of the modules, and deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) detects three electron-trap defect states in all modules with activation energies of electron emission from the defects of 0.07, 0.16, and 0.50 eV. DLTS measurements on the weathered modules show an additional deep-level, electron-trap defect state with an activation energy of 0.51 eV and a trap density of approximately 1012 cm−3. The capture rate is measured using varying short filling pulse times, and the resulting capture cross section is estimated to be 1.1x10−16 cm2. The development of the weathering-related defect level correlates to decreases in carrier lifetime, PL intensity, and module voltage. Various depths of the space charge region are probed with increments in applied reverse bias and filling-pulse bias. This DLTS depth profiling shows a trend of trap density increasing with less applied reverse bias, suggesting that the weathering-related defect increases carrier recombination toward the interface between the bulk silicon wafer and the junction-forming amorphous-silicon passivation layers.

Abstract: Regeneration serves as a self-protective mechanism that allows a tissue or organ to recover its entire form and function after suffering damage. However, the regenerative capacity varies greatly within the plant kingdom. Primitive plants frequently display an amazing regenerative ability as they have developed a complex system and strategy for long-term survival under extreme stress conditions. The regenerative ability of dicot species is highly variable, but that of monocots often exhibits extreme recalcitrance to tissue replenishment. Recent studies have revealed key factors and signals that affect cell fate during plant regeneration, some of which are conserved among the plant lineage. Among these, several members of the ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) transcription factors have been implicated in wound signaling, playing crucial roles in the regenerative mechanisms after different types of wounding. An understanding of plant regeneration may ultimately lead to an increased regenerative potential of recalcitrant species, producing more high-yielding, multi-resistant and environmentally friendly crops and ensuring the long-term development of global agriculture.

Abstract: The occurrence of autophagy dysregulation is vital in the development of myelodysplastic syndrome and its transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. However, the mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we have investigated the mechanism of the bcl6 corepressor mutation in myelodysplastic syndrome development and its transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. We identified a novel pathway involving histone deacetylase 6 and forkhead box protein O1, which leads to autophagy defects following the bcl6 corepressor mutation. And this further causes apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The bcl6 corepressor-mutation-repressed autophagy resulted in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, DNA, and reactive oxygen species in myelodysplastic syndrome cells, which could then lead to genomic instability and spontaneous mutation. Our results suggest that the bcl6 corepressor inactivating mutations exert pro-carcinogenic effects through survival strike, which is only an intermediate process. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of the bcl6 corepressor gene in myelodysplastic syndrome.

Abstract: Introduction
The immune reconstitution (IR) after the allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a progressive process intrinsically correlated to the therapeutic success. It is essential to understand the interfering factors in IR to prevent the HSCT-related mortality.
Methods
We retrospectively evaluated the clinical outcomes, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) and lymphocyte subtypes at different time-points of 111 pediatric patients with allogeneic HSCT for malignant and non-malignant diseases from 2013 to 2018.
Results
The ALCs gradually increased on D+30, D+100, and D+180 (medians 634/μL, 1022/μL and 1541/μL, respectively). On D+100, the CD3+CD8+ achieved the highest recovery rate (68%), followed by the CD16+CD56+ (47%), CD3+CD4+ (39%) and CD19+ (8%). The adequate ALC recovery was associated with age < 8 years, bone marrow grafts, myeloablative conditioning, non-use of serotherapy and non-haploidentical donors. The ALC and CD3+CD8+ on D+100 counts were higher in patients with the cytomegalovirus infection. The CD3+CD4+ recovery was associated with an age < 8 years, a non-malignant disease and a lower incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease ≥ grade 2. Furthermore, the ALC recovery on D+100 resulted in a higher overall survival, regardless of the disease type (HR 3.65, 1.05 - 12.71, p = 0.04).
Conclusion
Several factors influenced the IR after the allo-HSCT. The ALC ≥ 500/μL on D+100 was a simple IR predictor of survival, easily available to resource-limited centers.

Abstract: Sustainable and affordable solar energy production is critically dependent on the ability of photovoltaic (PV) modules to perform reliably in the outdoor environment over several decades. A suite of accelerated stress tests is central in the efforts to qualify the reliability of new module architectures and materials, which are evolving at a rapid pace. Complimentary to these, mathematical modelling of PV module degradation phenomena constitutes a useful set of tools that has become increasingly relevant in recent years. For certain degradation phenomena, modelling is best solved by numerical methods such as using the finite element modelling framework. These numerical methods can be computationally expensive, thus the input of longer timeseries of outdoor weather data can come at a high computational cost and require significant model simplifications. To alleviate this problem, we here present the use of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to select representative periods of historical outdoor weather data (or derivatives thereof). We exemplify the approach by selecting representative daily cell temperature profiles, instead of using the full timeseries, as input to modelling of thermomechanical fatigue in soldered ribbon cell interconnects. We explore how a subset of representative daily temperature profiles can reproduce key characteristics of the overall distribution of a multi-year dataset, as well as differences between datasets for sites in different climates. Such representative datasets could be used as input to complex PV module models and drastically reduce the computational costs.

Abstract: Herein, the conduction band minimum (EC) difference between the absorbing and buffer layers (named CBO) and that between the absorbing layer and the transparent conductive oxide (named ΔEC-TA) for the total band alignment of flexible and lightweight Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) solar cells on a stainless steel (SS) substrate with different structures were measured and optimized to improve their photovoltaic performances. Under different structures, the first buffer layers are Zn(O,S,OH)x, CdS, and (Cd,Zn)S, the second buffer layer is Zn0.84Mg0.16O, and the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer is Zn0.88Mg0.12O:Al, leading to different CBO and ΔEC-TA values. According to theoretical and experimental examinations, the replacement of ZnO:B TCO by Zn0.84Mg0.16O buffer/Zn0.88Mg0.12O:Al TCO results in the improvement of band bending (reduced carrier recombination) in the device, which is attributed to EC values of Zn0.84Mg0.16O buffer/Zn0.88Mg0.12O:Al TCO being shallower than that of ZnO:B, thus improving ΔEC-TA. Moreover, the Zn(O,S,OH)x and (Cd,Zn)S buffers give rise to the improved CBO in the device. Ultimately, experimental conversion efficiency of 18.1% for the flexible and lightweight CIGSSe solar cell on the SS substrate was obtained through the use of (Cd,Zn)S as the first buffer, Zn0.84Mg0.16O as the second buffer, and Zn0.84Mg0.16O, Zn0.88Mg0.12O:Al as the TCO layer, leading to the optimized CBO value of −0.01 eV and ΔEC-TA value of +0.16 eV, which reduced carrier recombination; this was well verified by the predicted numerical result.

However, two-dimensional layered perovskites have disordered phase distribution and multi-quantum well structure that are adversely to charge transport and extraction, resulting in the inability to obtain relatively satisfactory photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, we fabricated an 2D RP perovskite solar cell with reversely graded phase arrangement by friendly antisolvent method, and obtained the PCE of 14.45%. The dependence of efficiency on device architecture according to the vertical growth direction is further revealed and discussed. To investigate the effect of different antisolvents on crystal orientation and phase arrangement of GA-based 2D RP perovskites, we applied IPA as antisolvent and found that IPA not only significantly improved the surface roughness, quality and crystallinity of 2D perovskites but also reduce or even eliminate lower-n (n = 1, 2) phases and improve the vertical orientation of 2D phases in perovskites films, thereby improving charge transport and extraction. In the end, we achieved a champion PCE of 15.80%. These findings provide an effective guidance for developing GA-based organic spacers toward highly efficient and stable 2D PSCs with less quantum confinement.

Abstract: Nanoporous metal oxide ceramic coatings, deposited using sol-gel techniques, have the potential to impart self-sintering and self-cleaning coatings to silicon oxide glass. When used on solar photovoltaic modules, these coatings can impart anti-static properties, improve wetting behavior, and degrade soiling deposits through photocatalytic activity. This paper reports on a field trial of a mixed silicon and titanium oxide thin film coating conducted in the upper midwestern U.S. Coated modules demonstrated increased electrical generation relative to uncoated controls. The results are encouraging for the commercialization of this coating technology, and provide a strong motivation for further research and development efforts.

Abstract: Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a bone marrow failure disorder caused by autoimmune dysfunction. The presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) is the key step in initiating the immune response against unknown antigens in SAA patients. In the previous phase, we found that compared to healthy controls, patients with SAA had an increased proportion of circulating myeloid/conventional dendritic cells (mDCs/cDCs) with enhanced phagocytosis, more secretion of Th1-type cytokines (IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ) in the bone marrow, and a reduced proportion of Treg cells. In this study, we found that cDCs sorted from SAA patients had higher expression level of HLA-DQ, co-stimulatory molecules CD86, PTK and ERK1/2 than the remission SAA patients and healthy controls. Moreover, downregulation of HLA-DQ protein levels on cDCs derived from SAA patients resulted in reduced phagocytosis rate and CD86 expression of cDCs. When the cDCs above were co-cultured with CD4+ cells from the same patients, reduced secretion of Th1 type of lymphocyte cytokines was observed. Analysis of clinically relevant data suggests that HLA-DQ expression levels were closely related to disease severity and immune status of patients. These findings show that the role of HLA-DQ in the immunopathogenesis of SAA is potentially important and worth further study.

Abstract: Summary
Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to be a low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as the energy storage market keeps expanding. The organic material-based SIBs have the advantages of high capacity and optimizable molecular structure. However, poor conductivity and unstable cyclability hinder the application of organic materials in SIBs. Here, we introduce a carbomethoxy-modified insoluble quinone-based disodium salt (Na2dmcdbq) that enhances ionic diffusion by building ionic transportation channels. Na2dmcdbq shows impressive rate performance and cycle stability when coupled with carbon nanotubes. The composite electrode delivers 180 mAh/g capacity at 4,000 mA/g (22.5C) and retains 151 mAh/g capacity after 6,000 cycles. With a highly concentrated electrolyte, it achieves superior fast charge-discharge long-term cycle stability with a capacity retention of 76.8% after 35,000 at 40C. When pairing with a synthesized P2-type Na0.67Mn0.75Li0.25O2 cathode (550 Wh/kg), the full cell reaches 125 mAh/g capacity (0.2C) and runs for 1,000 cycles at 2C.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary hepatic cancer and is among the major causes of mortality due to cancer. Due to the lack of efficient conventional therapeutic options for this cancer, particularly in advanced cases, novel treatments including immunotherapy have been considered. However, despite the encouraging clinical outcomes after implementing these innovative approaches, such as oncolytic viruses (OVs), adoptive cell therapies (ACT), immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs), and cancer vaccines, several factors have restricted their therapeutic effect. The main concern is the existence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Combination of different ICBs or ICBs plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promising results in overcoming these limiting factors to some extent. Combination of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody Atezolizumab and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody Bevacizumab has become the standard of care in the first-line therapy for untestable HCC, approved by regulatory agencies. This paper highlighted a wide overview of the direct and indirect immunotherapeutic strategies proposed for the treatment of HCC patients and the common challenges that have hindered their further clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphorescence is a basic luminescence phenomenon that is represented by continuous light emission for a period after materials have absorbed excitation energy. Here, an obvious blue-green long phosphorescence is observed in some fluorescence areas of diamond wafers synthesized by high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) methods following X-ray excitation. Based on these results, we show that the blue-green fluorescence and long phosphorescence have contributions from two kinds of luminescence centers near the same emission wavelength (∼500 nm) in an HPHT diamond, i.e., the transition of the internal energy level of iron (Fe) under parity conservation rule and radiative recombination of nitrogen-boron donor-acceptor pair with the assistance of phonons. This study may help to inspire a deeper understanding of the long phosphorescence of wide-band-gap inorganic materials, and it also provides a possible and effective means of distinguishing between artificial and natural diamonds under X-ray radiation.

Abstract: Summary
Amidoxime-functionalized adsorbents have been pursued for uranium extraction from seawater, though competitive adsorption of vanadium and copper ions remains an issue. Herein, we report the successful design of a family of covalent organic framework (COF) adsorbents adopting an alternative chelating strategy for uranium binding comprising hydrazine-carbonyl sites with assistant groups for enhanced uranium uptake. A COF possessing hydroxypropoxy assistant groups (denoted as COF-R5) showed exceptional selectivity for uranium over vanadium and other metal ions, resulting in a fast uranium adsorption kinetics and high uptake capacity of 11.3 mg/g with a distribution coefficient over 9.2 × 105 mL/g in seawater, which exceeded most COFs previously reported in the literature. Mechanism studies revealed that hydroxypropoxy groups enhanced the binding of UO22+ at the COF’s hydrazine-carbonyl sites through hydrogen bonding interactions and charge stabilization effects, thus boosting the overall uranium affinity and adsorption capacity. Results validate the developed “uranium nanotraps” strategy for potential large-scale uranium extraction.

Abstract: High-altitude polycythemia (HAPC) is a chronic mountain sickness characterized by multiple severe ill-effects. Its pathogenesis is still unclear, and till date, no study has been conducted to investigate the plasma exome profile of Tibetan patients with HAPC. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the pathogenesis of HAPC by determining the microRNA (miRNA) signatures. We compared the plasma exosome miRNA expression profiles of eight patients with HAPC and eight healthy controls using next-generation miRNA sequencing. Further, we extracted and identified plasma exosomes using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blotting. We used quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to validate differentially expressed plasma exosomal miRNAs. Finally, we analyzed the diagnostic values of the differentially expressed miRNAs for HAPC using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We detected 2007 miRNAs from confirmed plasma exosomes, including 1342 known miRNAs and 665 newly predicted miRNAs. We verified the expression of the top 10 differentially expressed miRNAs via qRT-PCR. Patients with HAPC showed significantly upregulated hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-miR-4433b-3p, hsa-miR-1291, and hsa-miR-106b-5p expression levels, while hsa-miR-200c-3p expression was downregulated. This study may provide background knowledge for future studies on HAPC studies, which may further facilitate the development of novel therapies against this common disease.

Abstract: Introduction
Immunoglobulin represents the main therapy for patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and it is a safe procedure, but adverse events (AEs) can occur with variable frequencies.
Objective
To evaluate the frequency of immediate AEs to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) regular therapy in a pediatric cohort with IEI after a pre-IVIG infusion protocol.
Methods
This was a longitudinal study from 2011 to 2019 at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Brazil.
Results
A total of 1736 infusions were studied in 70 patients with IEI, 46 (65.7%) of whom were males and whose median age was 5.8 years old (range: 6 mo – 18 yo). Seven different brands of IVIG were used with the median loading dose of 0.57g/kg (range: 0.23 - 0.88g/Kg). According to the protocol, pre-medication and step-up infusion rate, were performed in 1305 (75.2%) infusions. Immediate AEs were noted in 10 children (14.3%) and in 22 (1.2%) infusions. Skin reactions (rash or urticaria) were the most common AE with 14 episodes (0.8% of all infusions). Almost all AEs were mild (19/86.4%), with no severe ones being observed. The majority of the AEs (81.8%) was identified at a 0.04ml/kg/min infusion rate. Gender, age at first infusion, presence of infection on the infusion day and change of the IVIG brand were evaluated and none of them were associated with AEs.
Conclusion
The low frequency of immediate AEs in children with IEI highlights the safety and tolerability of intravenous immunoglobulin replacement with the procedures established at our center.

Abstract: The current work focuses on the question if shingling can be a suitable interconnection method for perovskite-silicon tandem (PVST) cells. Cell-to-module (CTM) analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of the number of the metallization fingers and cut size (1/4, 1/5, 1/6 and 1/7 of the original wafer) on the I–V characteristics of PVST shingle cells, defining an optimum number of fingers for each of the cut sizes. The simulation was based on M6 wafers with an edge length of 166 mm, showing that smaller cut size with more fingers exhibit lower current, but higher fill factor and efficiency. Furthermore, power gains and losses from cell to module depending on the shingle size were analyzed. The simulation was based on a module design with 10 strings in parallel and shingles of 1/4, 1/5 and 1/6 cut sizes. CTM analysis revealed that smaller shingle cut sizes result in higher module efficiencies due to their higher initial efficiency and optical gains from overlap. According to the performed simulations, assuming an initial cell efficiency of 25.0 % (1/6 cut with 95 fingers), a module efficiency of 23.4 % can be reached. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of shingle interconnection and full-format module integration of PVST cells, low-temperature silver metallization with a screen-printing approach was utilized on M6 precursors provided by Oxford PV. After metallization, cells were cut (166 mm × 33.2 mm) and interconnected into shingle strings with an automatic process. They were then integrated in glass-glass (GG) solar modules. The prototype modules exhibited no visual defects and demonstrated performance in line with the initial cell efficiency. The highest achieved module efficiency was 22.8 % based on the aperture area of 1.5 m2 and exhibited a power PMPP of 336.5 W. Throughout the whole prototype fabrication process, only commercially available materials and industrial manufacturing equipment was used. To conclude, shingling has been demonstrated as a viable interconnection approach for PVST cells. Simulation and prototype production confirmed the potential of shingle modules to achieve high efficiencies.

Abstract: Summary
There is increasing interest in the role of metal halide perovskites for heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report a Ge-based 2D perovskite material that shows intrinsic water stability realized through organic cation engineering. Incorporating 4-phenylbenzilammonium (PhBz) we demonstrate, by means of extended experimental and computational results, that PhBz2GeBr4 and PhBz2GeI4 can achieve relevant air and water stability. The creation of composites embedding graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) allows a proof of concept for light-induced hydrogen evolution in an aqueous environment by 2D Ge-based perovskites thanks to the effective charge transfer at the heterojunction between the two semiconductors.

Abstract: Asbtract
Introduction
This study aimed to determine whether cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) antigen expression evaluated using multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) could predict the genotype of CRLF2 and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) status for application in the diagnosis of pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL).
Methods
A total of 321 BCP-ALL bone marrow samples were collected, 291 at diagnosis and 13 at first relapse, while 17 samples were excluded due to low cellular viability. The CRLF2 antigen expression was evaluated using flow cytometry (percentage of positivity and median fluorescence intensity [MFI]). The CRLF2 transcript levels were assessed via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using SYBR Green. The CRLF2 rearrangements (CRLF2-r) were identified using the CRLF2 break-apart probe via fluorescence in situ hybridization. Sanger sequencing was performed to identify the JAK2 exon 16 mutations.
Results
We observed that 60 of the 291 cases (20.6%) presented CRLF2 antigen positivity, whereas the CRLF2 transcript overexpression was found in 19 of 113 cases (16.8%). The JAK2 mutation was found in four out of 116 cases (3.4%), all of which had CRLF2 ≥10% of positive cells and intermediate or high MFI (p < 0.0001). In addition, in the 13 cases with the CRLF2-r, a positive correlation was found with the CRLF2 antigen intermediate (61.5%) MFI (p = 0.017). Finally, the CRLF2-positive antigen was identified in the BCP-ALL subclones.
Conclusion
The identification of the CRLF2 antigen using the MFC, based on the percentage of positivity and MFI values, is a useful tool for predicting JAK2 mutations and CRLF2-r.

Abstract: Objectives
To present the rheumatological manifestations of chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) and describe how they differ from primary systemic connective tissue diseases.
Methods
Description of 7 patients with cGVHD with symptoms resembling Sjögren's syndrome and scleroderma, with a critical review of the literature.
Results
7 patients treated at the hematology department, who developed cGVHD with present antinuclear antibodies, were referred to the rheumatology department for further evaluation. All patients presented symptoms of dry eye syndrome confirmed with ophthalmic tests. If the diagnosis of GVHD was not an exclusion criterion, Sjögren's syndrome criteria would be met by 4 of our patients – they presented not only with dryness but also with typical antibodies, inflammatory changes in salivary glands on ultrasound examination, and mononuclear cell infiltration in histopathological examination of labial salivary glands. Additionally, three patients presented with scleroderma-like syndromes, but with symptoms easy to differentiate from systemic sclerosis.
Conclusion
cGVHD may be difficult to distinguish from Sjögren's syndrome, but such distinction is important due to the different standards of treatment in cGVHD and primary connective tissue diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Biobased eco-plastics are an emerging class of sustainable materials. However, the synthesis of mechanically strong polymer materials usually needs high-purity monomers derived from biomass, which is not “green” during production. On the other hand, the recycling of plastics is highly desired for environmental protection. Here, we present a robust and facile strategy to design and prepare mechanically strong polyester amides (PEAs) from low-grade plant oils that can be treated as real eco-plastics. Low-grade C21 diacid (C21) derived from plant oils was chosen as the main monomer to synthesize mechanically strong PEAs via a one-pot condensation polymerization process. The resulting PEAs can be processed like thermoplastics. More importantly, the PEAs can undergo sustainable recycling, including physical recycling, hydro recycling, and composite recycling, without sacrificing their performance. The marriage of low monomer purity, thermoplastic-like behavior, and sustainable recycling can provide vital opportunities for developing novel eco-plastics to compete with traditional plastics.

Abstract: The bottleneck of cost-effective green hydrogen production through the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting process is lack of suitable materials. To address the material challenge, we have fabricated a heterostructure nanorod of WO3/ Fe2O3 utilizing a high-throughput radio frequency (RF) sputtering Physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique. With optimized parameters, such as as-deposited Fe of 70 nm, a deposition angle of 70°, and an annealing temperature of 500 °C, WO3/ Fe2O3 photoanodes with a morphology of vertically aligned nanorods were fabricated. A rod-like morphology with WO3 nanoparticles was synthesized by the addition of 15 nm of tungsten oxide (WO3) to the Fe2O3 nanorods. To study the optical behavior and morphology, the pristine and WO3 /Fe2O3 heterostructure thin films were characterized by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), ultraviolet UV, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This has led to a 5-fold improvement in PEC performance (0.588 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for the mixture compared to 0.122 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for the pristine). As a co-catalyst, WO3 successfully suppressed recombination and assisted in the hole transfer, which immediately increased the photocurrent density of fabricated photoanodes. This was illustrated via the electrochemical impedance spectra including both Nyquist and Mott-Schottky plots with or without illumination. When sustained in steady illumination for 900 s, this photoanode displayed highly stable behavior under PEC conditions.

Abstract: There are many reports on open-circuit voltage (VOC) degradation but limited reports on fill factor (FF) degradation in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells which are either subjected to an accelerated testing condition or to a field condition. The factors contributing to FF loss and VOC loss due to aging required a thorough investigation to gain insight into potential loss mechanisms and the approaches to mitigate them. In this context, we subjected SHJ solar cells of the same structure to varying accelerated testing conditions (i.e. exposure temperature of 90 °C versus 120 °C, under 1-sun illumination) in experiment 1 to 3 of this work. The SHJ cells exposed to a temperature of 90 °C were nearly stable in performance even after 2000 h while those exposed to 120 °C degraded significantly in FF. Device measurements and analysis revealed that the FF degradation was due to an increase in series resistance (Rs) and hole collection barrier. In experiment 4, the effect of device structure was investigated by subjecting cells with only front-side indium tin oxide (ITO) and those with both-sides ITO to the same accelerated testing conditions at a temperature of 90 °C under 1-sun illumination. The result obtained revealed that SHJ cells with both sides ITO were nearly stable in electrical performance while those with only front ITO degraded in performance, dominated by VOC loss. The VOC loss was perhaps due to loss of passivation at the rear-side of the cells.

Abstract: Summary
Ferrocyanides and ferricyanides are among the most employed positive electrolyte materials in aqueous flow battery research, but the limited solubility of commonly available sodium and potassium salts is a critical factor limiting application at scale. Here, we systematically study the cation-dependent solubility of these materials and, importantly, the cation-dependent stability of the anion in aqueous solution. For Li4Fe(CN)6, we report a maximum solubility of 2.3 M and show stable cycling of a 2 M symmetric cell, corresponding to electrolyte capacities of 54 Ah L−1, over 200 days. We also demonstrate solubilities of 1.6 M for ammonium and calcium salts and investigate the pronounced anion decomposition observed in the presence of ammonium cations. Our observations lead to a discussion of challenges associated with the osmotic strength of concentrated electrolytes that employ ions with high charge states, such as ferrocyanide.

Abstract: Metal halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation of photovoltaics, thanks to the excellent optoelectronic properties, low cost and facile fabrication. However, perovskite solar cells are still suffering from the poor stability, mainly, limited by the severe degradation after contact with water and oxygen. Hence, the encapsulation techniques are critical for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells for real-world applications. In this work, we systematically compared three encapsulation materials and fully evaluated the impact of encapsulation on the materials and device stability. We intentionally tested the encapsulated samples in accelerated aging conditions, such as immersing them in boiling water. These accelerated stressing can effectively distinguish the encapsulation quality in a short period. The resulted hero devices encapsulated with optimized techniques showed significantly improved stability, suggesting great potential for real applications.

Abstract: Summary
The lipid-α-Synuclein (α-Syn) interaction plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease. Here, we investigate the lipid-binding and -unbinding kinetics of α-Syn in an α-hemolysin (αHL) single nanopore. Under an applied voltage, an engineered α-Syn sequence can be trapped at the nanopore due to the dielectrophoretic force. The conformational switch events of α-Syn can be observed at the pore-membrane junction through the interpretation of blockade current amplitudes and dwell time. This allows further analysis of α-Syn conformational dynamics. We study how disease-associated metal ions (Cu2+, Zn2+) modulate the dynamics of α-Syn at the interface of the membranes and pore and how α-helical peptidomimetics stabilize the helical conformation of α-Syn in a lipidic environment. These studies aid our understanding of the complexity of the interaction of α-Syn, lipid membranes, and metal ions, and in using peptidomimetics, a new strategy against α-Syn toxicity and aggregation is advanced.

Abstract: Solar-driven water evaporation is a promising approach to solve the issue of water resource shortage. Herein, a cellulose acetate (CA)/graphene(G) nanofiber membrane evaporator with superior oil resistance was prepared by electrospinning and subsequently with the deacetylation process. The as-fabricated d-CA/G composite nanofiber membranes possess high solar absorption, high porosity, and low thermal conductivity. The evaporation rate of d-CA/G composite nanofiber membrane with a graphene concentration of 3 % for pure water can reach 1.38 kg m−2 h−1 with the corresponding efficiency of 88.4 % under one sun illumination. Moreover, the d-CA/G composite nanofiber membrane possesses super hydrophilic and underwater superoleophobicity. Thus, the d-CA/G composite nanofiber membrane can resist fouling by oils and dissolve the concentrated salt back into bulk water, resulting in efficient purification capacity for oil-in-water emulsion and stable desalination performance for seawater in the long term. The evaporation rate of the d-CA/G evaporator can approach 1.37 kg m−2 h−1 when used for the purification of oil-in-water emulsion. This study provides a facile way for the development of multifunctional nanofiber membrane evaporators with highly efficient and sustainable for seawater desalination and wastewater treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular matrix-derived biomaterials, such as gelatin-based hydrogels, are attractive candidates for sealing internal leakages. However, gelatin derivatives are brittle and suffer from poor adhesion. Modifications of gelatin with adhesive catechol moieties have been limited to low degrees of substitution. Here, we propose oxidative oligomerization of catecholic compounds (namely, caffeic acid [CA]) prior to the coupling reaction to augment the number and availability of grafted catechol groups per carbodiimide conjugation reaction, thereby achieving robust bioadhesion. Ex vivo adhesion tests on pig lungs suggests ∼3× improvement in adhesion strength compared with gelatin methacryloyl controls due to their enhanced cohesion (i.e., ∼5.3× and ∼11.5× improvements in stretchability and toughness, respectively). Functionalization of gelatin with CA oligomers enables rapid formation of physical gels upon exposure to room temperature, tunes the viscosity of the gelatin-caffeic acid pre-gel solution for controllable injectability onto multiply curved tissues, and boosts the antioxidant effects of CA.

Abstract: Introduction
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) presents a poor prognosis in adults. The adoption of pediatric protocols has been changing this scenario, especially for adolescents and young adults (AYA).
Objective and method
We aimed to evaluate a consecutive series of patients treated at the State Institute of Hematology of Rio de Janeiro between 2012 and 2020, focusing on the AYA subgroup.
Result
The B-ALL was the most frequent subtype (81.6%) and AYA, the predominant age group (57.7%). The median overall survival (OS) was 9.4 months. High early mortality was observed and sepsis was the main cause of death. Better OS results were noted in AYA, in comparison to over 39y (13.3 × 6.2 months, respectively), the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) being the protocol of choice in this group.
Conclusion
The use of the pediatric protocol seems to improve the OS of AYA, however, high rates of deaths from infection were observed, demonstrating the need for advances in the Brazilian public system clinical support.

Abstract: Objective
To evaluate and estimate the cost of basic care in sickle cell disease (SCD) for patients under five years of age, within the scope of the Unified Health System (SUS) and to discuss the costs related to possible complications of the disease from the literature.
Methods
The main management and conduct recommendations in the SCD up to five years of age, with healthy and baseline health status, were extracted from the Basic Guidelines of the Care Line in the SCD of the Ministry of Health. Systematic data regarding costs of medicines were extracted from the Medicine Market Regulation Chamber. The SUS Table of Procedures, Medicines and Orthotics, Prosthetics and Auxiliary Means of Movement Management System was the guide for the values of complementary exams, as well as for medical consultations. The values applied to calculate the vaccination schedule were extracted from the Pan American Health Organization, adopting the perspective of the SUS-paying costs.
Results
The total cost obtained for basic care of SCD in children up to five years of age, including the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, immunizations and the performance of transcranial Doppler ultrasound in the prevention and early detection of cerebrovascular accidents was, on average, $1020.96.
Conclusion
The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis in SCD, up to five years of age, exceeds the expenses resulting from hospitalizations due to complications of the disease. The study of expenses associated with SCD could be used to establish public policies, improve prevention strategies and treat the symptoms and complications of the disease.

Abstract: Introduction
In Brazil, the blood donor screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) includes laboratory testing for serological (HBsAg and Anti-HBc) and molecular (HBV DNA) markers. This study aims to correlate serology reactive results with HBV DNA detection among blood donors with at least one HBV infection marker detected in a blood bank in northern Brazil.
Method
A retrospective search for HBV reactive blood donor data from January 2017 to December 2019 was performed. Serological screening was performed by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays Architect HBsAg and Architect Anti-HBc, whereas molecular screening was performed by the HBV nucleic acid test (HBV NAT).
Main results
A total of 556 HBsAg reactive results were detected, between positive (47.66%) and inconclusive (52.34%). A total of 3,658 Anti-HBc reactive results were detected, between positive (83.71%) and inconclusive (16.29%). None of the inconclusive results were associated with HBV DNA detection. The HBV DNA detection rates were 47.55% among HBsAg positive samples and 4.08% among Anti-HBc positive samples. The signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratio median of HBV NAT positive samples was superior in comparison to HBV NAT negative samples (p < 0.0001). The thresholds found to optimize sensitivity and specificity were 404.15 for Architect HBsAg and 7.77 for Architect Anti-HBc. Three blood donors were in the window period and 1 occult HBV infection case was detected.
Conclusion
High S/CO ratios were more predictive of HBV DNA detection. However, a number of HBV NAT positive samples gave low values, while some HBV NAT negative samples showed high values, reaffirming the significance of molecular testing to enhance transfusion safety.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of fluorescence color and wavelength of organic luminescent materials is important for their practical applications. However, the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect in the aggregate state, complex synthesis, sophisticated regulations, and abrupt color transitions of most materials have made such a mission challenging. Here, we develop a color-tunable solid-emitters system based on mechanochromic aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). By changing the molecular structure and molecular packing of AIEgens, the wavelength and color of emissions can be adjusted smoothly and easily across the entire visible spectrum. In addition to their reversible, tunable, and highly efficient fluorescence, these AIEgens have the advantage of being difficult to quantify and imitate because of their force response. Taking advantage of these excellent performances, we develop three applications based on the advanced solid optical materials: (1) 4D code, (2) anti-counterfeiting patterns, and (3) full-color light-emitting diodes.

Abstract: This work presents a study of p-type passivating contacts based on SiCx formed via a rapid thermal processing (RTP) step, using conditions compatible with the firing used to sinter screen-printed metallization pastes in industry. The contributions of the two interfaces (wafer/contact and contact/metal) to the contact resistivity are first decorrelated, identifying tunnelling at the wafer interface as the main contribution. We then investigate the influence of the active dopant concentration on the contact resistivity and the SiCx sheet resistance and propose strategies to reduce both resistances by increasing the thermal budget applied during RTP. Lastly, we discuss potentials and limitations of implementing the investigated stacks as rear side contacts of p-type devices with localized metallization. We demonstrate that increasing the thermal budget during RTP can effectively mitigate resistive losses and enhance contact performance and we show that an oxide layer that can withstand high thermal budgets is the key factor for obtaining simultaneously high passivation quality and good electrical properties. We investigate three different oxide types grown by HNO3 immersion, UV-O3 exposure and N2O plasma oxidation. The latter is demonstrated to be a promising candidate for an application in devices fabricated with high RTP thermal budget.

Abstract: Reducing the sintering temperature and time of mesoporous titanium dioxide (m-TiO2) from the standard thermal approach of baking at 500 °C for 1 h is an important step for employment of mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We present a robust method based on atmospheric pressure ambient air plasma of the diffuse coplanar surface barrier discharge (DCSBD) for sintering of m-TiO2 in 2.5 min at 70 °C. When implemented in PSCs as an electron transport layer an efficiency of (15.8 ± 1.0) % was achieved, which is on the same level as a standard thermal approach. The organic moieties which hinder the perovskite infiltration into the porous structure were removed to a similar extent as the thermal sintering. The approach does not affect the conduction band alignment with the perovskite absorber and an appropriate energy offset is preserved.

Abstract: A prognostic scoring system that can differentiate β-thalassemia patients based on mortality risk is lacking. We analysed data from 3145 β-thalassemia patients followed through a retrospective cohort design for the outcome of death. An a priori list of prognostic variables was collected. β Coefficients from a multivariate cox regression model were used from a development dataset (n = 2516) to construct a formula for a Thalassemia International Prognostic Scoring System (TIPSS) which was subsequently applied to a validation dataset (n = 629). The median duration of observation was 10.0 years. The TIPSS score formula was constructed as exp (1.4 × heart disease + 0.9 × liver disease + 0.9 × diabetes + 0.9 × sepsis + 0.6 × alanine aminotransferase ≥42 IU/L + 0.6 × hemoglobin ≤9 g/dL + 0.4 × serum ferritin ≥1850 ng/mL). TIPSS score thresholds of greatest differentiation were assigned as <2.0 (low-risk), 2.0 to <5.0 (intermediate-risk), and ≥5.0 (high-risk). The TIPSS score was a good predictor for the outcome of death in the validation dataset (AUC: 0.722, 95%CI: 0.641–0.804) and survival was significantly different between patients in the three risk categories (P < 0.001). Compared to low-risk patients, the hazard ratio for death was 2.778 (95%CI: 1.335–5.780) in patients with intermediate-risk and 6.431 (95%CI: 3.151–13.128) in patients with high-risk. This study provides a novel tool to support mortality risk categorization for patients with β-thalassemia that could help management and research decisions.

Abstract: d-Ribose is not only an important component of some biomacromolecules, but also an active pentose with strong reducibility and non-enzymatic glycation ability. Previous studies reported the diverse role of d-ribose in different cells. In this study, the effects of d-ribose on non-enzymatic glycation of hemoglobin (Hb), as well as eryptosis, oxidative stress and energy metabolism of erythrocytes were observed by molecular fluorescence spectrophotometry, multi-wavelength spectrophotometry, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry (MS) and flow cytometer. The results showed that d-ribose had the strongest non-enzymatic glycation ability to Hb in vitro when compared with other monosaccharides, and could enter the erythrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, which was not inhibited by the specific glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) inhibitor WZB117. In addition, d-ribose incubation increased the HbA1c, hemolysis, eryptosis, and ROS level of erythrocytes significantly more than that of d-glucose, however, no changes were observed in the levels of ATP, NADPH, and other intermediate energy metabolites in d-ribose treatment. Therefore, the strong non-enzymatic glycation ability of d-ribose may play an important role in erythrocyte damage.

Abstract: Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy conversion systems have gained great interest in recent years as they can directly convert thermal energy into electricity using photovoltaic (PV) cells. The increase of the radiative power and the power conversion efficiency in TPV systems is mainly due to two key factors. The first one deals with the nature of the selective emitter. A new high temperature selective emitter should be designed to have a high emissivity (absorptivity) above the bandgap energy (Eg) and a low emissivity below Eg of the PV cells. The second key factor is related to the cooling mechanism of the PV cell as the conversion efficiency of the latter degrades with increasing temperature. In this work, we first propose and investigate a new efficient metamaterial thermal emitter, to reach a desired emissivity in the wavelength range 0.8−1.72μm. Secondly, to minimize the operating temperature of the TPV system, a passive radiative cooling approach is suggested in which an efficient double-layer coating deposited on the substrate of PV cells is elaborated. It has a high emissivity in the atmospheric transparency windows 8−13μm and low absorptivity in the solar spectrum 0.3−8μm. We show that the high-temperature metamaterial design can achieve high emissivity, over 0.97 in the wavelength range, 0.8−1.72μm, while reducing the sub-band loss of the PV cells. At 1400K, we demonstrate that adding the proposed cooling design to the substrate of a GaSb PV cell panel with an area ratio between the passive radiative cooler and the PV cell panel of γ=20, can improve the efficiency of the latter by 2% and drop its operating temperature by 44K.

Abstract: Summary
Atomically thin 2D nanopores have emerged as promising platforms from nanofluidics research to practical applications. Low-frequency flicker noise in 2D nanopores limits detection accuracy and performance of nanopore sensors. However, the physical mechanisms of low-frequency noise are still under debate and achieving its control in 2D nanopores remains challenging. Here, we report multivalent-cations-modulated low-frequency noise in graphene nanopores and demonstrate that low-frequency noise originates from surface charge fluctuations induced by reversible adsorption-desorption of ions. Unexpectedly, its amplitude can be greatly controlled up to about 3 orders of magnitude by a trace of multivalent cations (at least 0.1% of concentration in mixture solutions). Moreover, low-frequency noise can be suppressed by 2 orders of magnitude via adding organic solvents with a high dielectric constant based on suppressing interactions between surface charge and ions. Our findings will facilitate understanding of low-frequency noise in nanofluidics and design of related applications including ultrasensitive nanofluidic devices.

Abstract: Resistance to radio and chemotherapy in Glioblastoma (GBM) is correlated with its malignancy, invasiveness, and aggressiveness. The Rho GTPase pathway plays important roles in these processes, but its involvement in the GBM response to genotoxic treatments remains unsolved. Inhibition of this signaling pathway has emerged as a promising approach for the treatment of CNS injuries and diseases, proving to be a strong candidate for therapeutic approaches. To this end, Rho-associated kinases (ROCK), classic downstream effectors of small Rho GTPases, were targeted for pharmacological inhibition using Y-27632 in GBM cells, expressing the wild-type or mutated p53 gene, and exposed to genotoxic stress by gamma ionizing radiation (IR) or cisplatin (PT). The use of the ROCK inhibitor (ROCKi) had opposite effects in these cells: in cells expressing wild-type p53, ROCKi reduced survival and DNA repair capacity (reduction of γH2AX foci and accumulation of strand breaks) after stress promoted by IR or PT; in cells expressing the mutant p53 protein, both treatments promoted longer survival and more efficient DNA repair, responses further enhanced by ROCKi. The target DNA repair mechanisms of ROCK inhibition were, respectively, an attenuation of NHEJ and NER pathways in wild-type p53 cells, and a stimulation of HR and NER pathways in mutant p53 cells. These effects were accompanied by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by genotoxic stress only in mutant p53 cells but potentiated by ROCKi and reversed by p53 knockdown. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) treatment or Rac1 knockdown completely eliminated ROCKi's p53-dependent actions, since ROCK inhibition specifically elevated Rac-GTP levels only in mutant p53 cells. Combining IR or PT and ROCKi treatments broadens our understanding of the sensitivity and resistance of, respectively, GBM expressing wild-type or mutant p53 to genotoxic agents. Our proposal may be a determining factor in improving the efficiency and assertiveness of CNS antitumor therapies based on ROCK inhibitors.
Significance
The use of ROCK inhibitors in association with radio or chemotherapy modulates GBM resistance and sensitivity depending on the p53 activity, suggesting the potential value of this protein as therapeutic target for tumor pre-sensitization strategies.

Abstract: This article presents the electrochromic behaviors of three photocurable allyl viologens: diallyl-dipyridyl-ethylene bridged viologen (DA-DPyEV), diallyl-tetrapyridyl phenyl bridged viologen (DA-TPyPhV), and diallyl viologen (DAV), which were designed to achieve RGB colorations. The viologen-based ion gel was utilized to prepare single-layered electrochromic devices (ECDs), thus overcoming the leakage issues commonly associated with liquid electrolytes. The individual ECDs displayed outstanding electrochromic performance, including high transmittance differences and cyclic stability, forming a wide color gamut. Additionally, we fabricated transmissive-to-black ECDs by combining the three viologens in appropriate ratios. The black coloration was achieved through subtractive color mixing theory and showed fast switching speed and high coloration efficiency. Furthermore, we manufactured a flexible large-area ECD with a working area of 10 cm × 10 cm using PET-ITO electrodes. The prepared device exhibited excellent electrochromic performance, showing stable and repeated switching behavior over extended periods. Due to substantial absorption in broad spectral regions, the flexible ECDs demonstrated excellent heat-shielding capabilities, significantly reducing indoor temperatures. Overall, the current findings suggest the potential of photocurable allyl viologens for producing flexible color-changing film devices that generate various visible colors while blocking outdoor heat flux.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) backsheets protect solar cells from corrosion, moisture intrusion, and environmental pollution, and they also reflect light to be reabsorbed by solar cells. Previous studies have confirmed that PV backsheet materials can affect the performance of PV modules. In this study, the performance of the backsheet under a single ultraviolet (UV) aging condition and its influence on the electrical performance of the PV module were explored so as to establish the relationship between backsheet aging and PV module performance. The results of this study show that UV irradiation is the main factor leading to the aging and cracking of backsheets. When the backsheet was exposed to a UV dose of 60 kWh/m2, the elongation at break of the backsheet was reduced by 97.04%, the tensile strength was reduced by 60.10%, the reflectivity of the backsheet was reduced by 8.36%, and the power and short-circuit current of the PV module decreased by 3.69% and 3.96%, respectively. The primary cause for the decline in PV module power was determined to be the reduction in backsheet reflectivity, which diminished the available light that could undergo re-reflection onto the solar cell, thereby resulting in a reduction of the short-circuit current. These findings provide valuable insights into the changes in the physicochemical properties of UV-aged backsheets and their power decay mechanism in PV modules. The results establish an invaluable link between the testable characteristics of backsheet aging and PV module performance.

Abstract: Introduction
The para-Bombay phenotype, or H-deficient secretor, results from different mutations of the FUT1, with or without the FUT2 mutation. Consequently, there is an absent or weak expression of the H antigen on red blood cells (RBCs). Routine ABO blood grouping for two siblings with blood group O showed discrepant results with their parental blood group AB. Fragments encompassing the entire coding region of the FUT1 and FUT2 genes were investigated.
Methods
Blood and saliva specimens were collected to verify the correct ABO grouping by cell grouping, serum grouping and the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, respectively. The FUT1 and FUT2 genomes were identified using the whole-exome sequencing (WES) in two children's DNA blood specimens and may have caused, or been relative to, their blood group. Genetic variations of the FUT1 and FUT2 genes have been investigated in the other family members using the Sanger sequencing.
Results
The serologic reaction results of the proband revealed that A, B and H antigens were absent on RBCs, and that the serum contained anti-H. However, ABH and AH antigens were present in the saliva PB1 and PB2, respectively. The probands PB1 and PB2 were assigned as AB and A blood groups, respectively. Blood genotyping confirmed that heterozygous mutations of the FUT1 gene, c.551_552delAG, were identified. Three family members, PB3, PB, and PB8, also showed normal ABO blood groups, but their genotypes were also the FUT1 mutation c.551_552delAG.
Conclusions
The FUT1 mutation c.551_552delAG may result in the reduced or absent H antigen production on RBCs, which characterizes the para-Bombay phenotypes. Blood genotyping is essential if these individuals need a blood transfusion or are planning to donate blood.

Abstract: The broadband absorption of the solar spectrum, which is central to solar cell technology. Despite more than a decade of development in this field, current structures obtained using conventional materials and artificial design methods still struggle to meet realistic needs. MXenes has been shown to be one of the most promising solar-absorbing materials due to its good spectral selectivity. The optical properties of MXenes depend mainly on its terminal groups and in this paper the absorption properties of different MXenes-based metasurface absorbers (MMA) in the solar spectrum are systematically investigated. Random forest regression models are constructed separately for MMAs of different terminal groups, and machine learning (ML) is used to complete the whole process from parameter selection to structure optimization (the error is only 0.02%). The simulation results show that the MMAO (Ti3C2O2) absorbs 93.19% in the solar spectrum and emits only 1.21% in the MIR band (5000 – 13000 nm), which is a near-perfect solar absorber. The combination of MXenes and metasurfaces is feasible and effective, and the combination of ML can achieve high accuracy prediction of MMA structural parameters, which provides a new idea for the material selection and design methods of solar–thermal energy collecting and manipulation.

Abstract: Elevated levels of circulating cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) are an integral feature of several clinical conditions including sickle cell anemia, sepsis, hemodialysis and cardiopulmonary bypass. Oxidized (Fe3+, ferric) hemoglobin contributes to the pathophysiology of these disease states and is therefore widely studied in experimental models, many of which use commercially sourced CFH. In this study, we treated human endothelial cells with commercially sourced ferric hemoglobin and observed the appearance of dense cytoplasmic aggregates (CAgg) over time. These CAgg were intensely autofluorescent, altered intracellular structures (such as mitochondria), formed in multiple cell types and with different media composition, and formed regardless of the presence or absence of cells. An in-depth chemical analysis of these CAgg revealed that they contain inorganic components and are not pure hemoglobin. To oxidize freshly isolated hemoglobin without addition of an oxidizing agent, we developed a novel method to convert ferrous CFH to ferric CFH using ultraviolet light without the need for additional redox agents. Unlike commercial ferric hemoglobin, treatment of cells with the fresh ferric hemoglobin did not lead to CAgg formation. These studies suggest that commercially sourced CFH may contain stabilizers and additives which contribute to CAgg formation.

Abstract: Summary
Accessing high voltages (>9 V) and high power density in microbatteries with volumes below ∼0.25 cm3 is challenging. At such scales, energy density and voltage are highly constrained by packaging and serial integration of cells. Here, we demonstrate hermetically sealed, durable, compact (volume ≤ 0.165 cm3) batteries with low package mass fraction (10.2%) in single- (∼4 V), double- (∼8 V), and triple-stacked (∼12 V) configurations with energy densities reaching 990 Wh Kg−1 and 1,929 Wh L−1 (triple-stacked battery discharged at C/10) and high power density for continuous and pulsed discharge (∼124 mW cm−2 for triple-stacked battery at C/2 continuous discharge, ∼75 mW cm−2 for double-stacked battery at 2C pulsed discharge). We achieve the high voltage-power-energy density landscape by using current collectors as the package and serial stacking of bifancial dense electrodeposited LiCoO2 cathode, Li-metal anode electrodes. Our microbatteries power wireless communication electronics, motors, and actuators, paving the way toward highly functional microdevices.

Abstract: Cancer cells prefer to utilizing aerobic glycolysis to generate energy and anabolic metabolic intermediates for cell growth. However, whether the activities of glycolytic enzymes can be regulated by specific posttranslational modifications, such as SUMOylation, in response to oncogenic signallings, thereby promoting the Warburg effect, remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), a key glycolytic enzyme, interacts with SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 and is SUMOylated at K302 in glioblastoma cells. Expression of UBC9, which competitively prevents the binding of ubiquitin E3 ligase APC/C to PFKFB3 and subsequent PFKFB3 polyubiquitination, increases PFKFB3 stability and expression. Importantly, EGFR activation increases the interaction between UBC9 and PFKFB3, leading to increased SUMOylation and expression of PFKFB3. This increase is blocked by inhibition of EGFR-induced AKT activation whereas expression of activate AKT by itself was sufficient to recapitulate EGF-induced effect. Knockout of PFKFB3 expression decreases EGF-enhanced lactate production and GBM cell proliferation and this decrease was fully rescued by reconstituted expression of WT PFKFB3 whereas PFKFB3 K302R mutant expression abrogates EGF- and UBC9-regulated lactate production and GBM cell proliferation. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism underlying the regulation of the Warburg effect through the EGFR activation-induced and UBC9-mediated SUMOylation and stabilization of PFKFB3.

Abstract: In the present work, the impact of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) degrees of severity, as well hydroxyurea treatment on the systemic immunological signatures of patients was evaluated. Based on a high-throughput chemokine, cytokine and growth factor multiplex analysis, it was possible to obtain the systemic immunological profile of patients with SCD (n = 40), treated or not with hydroxyurea, as compared to healthy controls (n = 40). Overall, SCD patients with severe disease displayed increased levels of almost all biomarkers analyzed. Our data demonstrated that CXCL8, CCL3 and CXCL10 were pointed out as universal biomarkers of SCD. The results also indicated that HU-untreated patients with indication of HU-therapy display a more prominent increase on plasma immune mediators in a similar way as those with severe SCD disease. Together, these findings provided a comprehensive landscape of evidence that may have implications for further therapeutic strategies and SCD clinical management.

Abstract: Summary
2D lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are highly attractive for fabrication of thin-film transistors (TFTs) due to their promising charge transport properties, mitigated ion migration effect, and high stability. However, thus far there have been no reports of 2D LHP TFTs that can operate well at room temperature. Herein, we report a simple device fabrication strategy for 2D LHP TFTs. 2D LHP TFTs are successfully obtained via a low-temperature solution process, and they show mobility approaching 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of about 104 with negligible hysteresis at room temperature. Moreover, the devices feature high bias-stress stability and storage stability. Additionally, large-area TFT arrays show a high degree of uniformity in device performance and exhibit capability for photodetection imaging. This study provides solutions to address the challenges in device fabrication of 2D LHP TFTs and demonstrate their potential for practical applications.

Abstract: The tunneling recombination junction (TRJ) of efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem cells should possess excellent optoelectronic characteristics to minimize light parasitic absorption and carrier transport/recombination losses. One effective approach is the utilization of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon-oxygen (nc-SiOx: H) materials, which characteristics can be controlled by adjusting the flow rate of CO2 and doped gas during the fabrication process. By carefully screening the material properties, the suitable n/p-doped nc-SiOx: H materials can be identified. For n-nc-SiOx: H, it is necessary to use a lower CO2 flux and perform moderate doping, while for p-nc-SiOx: H, strict control of CO2 and Trimethylboron (TMB) fluxes at lower levels is essential to preserve the electrical properties. Compared to the TRJ based on nc-Si: H, the TRJ based on nc-SiOx: H exhibits notable improvements in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) of the tandem cell. The VOC increases by 38 mV (from 1.822 V to 1.864 V), and the JSC gains 0.82 mA/cm2 (from 19.00 mA/cm2 to 19.82 mA/cm2). Consequently, the conversion efficiency of the tandem cell, with an aperture area of 0.5091 cm2, is enhanced from 25.70% to 27.16%. Additionally, by considering the distinct lateral and vertical growth characteristics of nc-SiOx: H, the fill factor (FF) experiences a significant enhancement when applied to the TRJ of large-area tandem cells. Specifically, the FF increases from 55.21% to 69.68%. As a result, for a tandem cell with an aperture area of 12.5 cm2, the conversion efficiency improves from 17.87% to 23.39%.

Abstract: Summary
Light-induced degradation of Si solar cells when deployed in warmer climates can cause up to a ∼10% relative degradation in efficiency, but the atomic structure of the defect responsible for this degradation remains elusive. Herein, using electron paramagnetic resonance, we show that the defect responsible for light- and elevated-temperature-induced degradation (LeTID) is likely an Si dangling bond within an extended defect such as a vacancy agglomerate, with H atoms in its vicinity and likely O nearby. Our atomistic-level insights suggest that the defect responsible for LeTID can be mitigated by targeted engineering of the intrinsic defect populations by optimizing annealing routines prior to or during device fabrication and by controlling the amount of H injected in the Si bulk during cell processing. Mitigating LeTID through detailed knowledge of its atomic structure can help preserve the long-term efficiency of gigawatts of future worldwide installations of solar based on crystalline Si.

Abstract: In this work, a detailed study is conducted on the visible transmittance, solar reflectance, and emissivity properties of low-emissivity coatings composed of one, two, and three layers of silver. The results demonstrate significant enhancements in both optical and thermal properties achievable by increasing the number of silver layers, leading to coatings that are more transparent in the visible spectrum, more reflective in the near-infrared, with lower emissivity and lower sheet resistance. The aesthetic adjustment possibilities of the different structures are also examined, with coatings composed of three layers of silver being more flexible.

Abstract: Introduction
Hypogonadism is one of the most frequent complications in transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients and early recognition and treatment is the core element in restoring impaired gonadal function. Despite the high burden of disease, relevant studies are scarcely addressing the gonadal function of such patients in Bangladesh. The pattern of gonadal function in transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients must be characterized before planning a generalized management plan. Moreover, since iron overload is a key reason behind hypogonadism in thalassemia patients, investigating the role of serum ferritin level as a diagnostic tool for hypongadism was also an aim of this study.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Transfusion Medicine of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 94 patients were enrolled in this study. A detailed history and thorough clinical examination were carried out in each patient and recorded using a pretested structured questionnaire. In addition, the laboratory assessment of serum ferritin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone and estradiol in serum were also performed. The data were analyzed using the STATA (v.16).
Results
The mean age of the patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia was 18.81 ± 4.65 (SD), with 53.3% of the patients being male. The overall prevalence of hypogonadism was 35.11%, 18.1% being normogonadotropic, 11.7% being hypogonadotropic and 5.3% being hypergonadotropic. The serum ferritin level was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in patients with hypogonadism (Eugonadal: 2,174.79 (± 749.12) ng/ml; Hypogonadal: 3,572.59 (± 1,199.49) ng/ml). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of serum ferritin was high (0.83) and the p-value was highly significant (< 0.001).
Conclusion
Therefore, the serum ferritin level and gonadal hormone analysis of transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients can be considered a screening tool for assessing gonadal function and early detection and prevention of hypogonadism.

Abstract: A series of 16 salt mixtures consisting of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as the base salt and a secondary salt hydrate in a 20 : 1 mol ratio of anhydrous K2CO3 to anhydrous additive were investigated as potential thermochemical heat storage (TCHS) composites. Those materials were evaluated based on their (de)hydration temperatures and reaction kinetics to find a suitable secondary salt mixture with enhanced phase change behaviour. The improved performance is expected to come from the enhancement of ionic mobility due to the deliquescence of the secondary salt. Based on the screening, we found that deliquescent and highly soluble salts are prone to reacting with K2CO3, forming new compounds that do not impact the behaviour of the base salt. Therefore, the most promising additives were salts that share a common ion with K2CO3 (KF, Cs2CO3) or salts that can react with K2CO3 forming a highly deliquescent salt (CsF, Cs2SO4). Based on the findings, we were able to design a selection procedure that can be applied to other salt hydrates considered for TCHS applications that suffer from poor kinetics and large reaction hysteresis.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the effects of aluminum and aluminum oxide within CuInAl precursor films on the formation process of Cu(InAl)Se2 (CIASe) thin films. We carried out a large number of experiments to optimize the conditions for obtaining CIASe thin films with excellent adhesion and electrical properties. Our findings suggest that the fabrication conditions of the precursor films, such as the vacuum level of sputtering chamber and the structure of the precursor films, significantly affect to the growth of the CIASe layer during selenization annealing. Through a series of experiments, we successfully obtained a 2.4 μm-thick CIASe thin film with strong adhesion to the Mo-coated substrate and fabricated a CIASe solar cell with an efficiency of 7.7%. Our study demonstrates the great potential of the two-step fabrication approach for CIASe thin film production, and further improvements are expected by optimizing the fabrication conditions.

Abstract: Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are dual purpose, providing both energy and building functions. Aesthetics play a crucial role in the BIPV market, with increasing demand for uniformly colored modules for building skins. Achieving this requires hiding ribbons and metal connections while not compromising durability, and ink coating offers a potential automated solution. This work presents a comparison of three coated metallic ribbons: one commercially pre-coated and two coated with UV-curable-inkjet printing. Glass/backsheet samples with standard or UV-blocking encapsulant were tested through accelerated ageing UV exposure. Results show that the commercially coated ribbons remain stable after 120 kWh/m2 of UV, but the UV-curable-inkjet tested inks show color changes in the encapsulant surrounding metallic interconnects in all cases. Yellowing is attributed to photodegradation of the ink's #1 main component, 2-phenoexyethyl-acrylate. However, PV module performance remains stable despite the color shift, with less than 3% power loss after exposure to 360 kWh/m2 of UV.

Abstract: Spherocytosis is a hereditary disease caused by the deficiencies of different membrane proteins of red blood cells. Currently, splenectomy is the main therapeutic strategy available, although it is accompanied by an increased risk of sepsis. Several evidences have supported the hypothesis of spleen dysfunction in patients with spherocytosis that haven't yet undergone splenectomy. The aim of this study is to furtherly characterize this aspect, by describing the immune subpopulations in peripheral blood samples obtained from 41 pediatric patients with hereditary spherocytosis by flow cytometry, in order to evaluate changes in the composition of the immune populations compared to 16 healthy donors. Patients were divided in two groups: splenectomized and non-splenectomized. In the splenectomized population, data showed neutrophilic leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, increase in NK and reduction in CD4+ lymphocytes. However, we observed that most of the results obtained in the splenectomized group were found in the non-splenectomized patients as well (increase in neutrophils, in NK, reduction of CD19+, CD4+ lymphocytes and CD4+ and CD8+ naïve cells). The alterations of the immune system may be mainly due to the disease itself, regardless of splenectomy. Therefore, immunological criteria could be included in clinical phenotype assessment in order to better optimize the timing for splenectomy.

Abstract: Summary
Asymmetric ring opening (ARO) of strained oxa- and azabicyclic alkenes has emerged as a powerful tool for the construction of chiral cyclic molecules with multiple stereocenters. In this article, we successfully apply the strategy of cross-electrophile coupling in the ARO reaction of oxa- and azabicyclic alkenes. While previous reports have focused on the use of nucleophilic organometallics, this work enables the direct use of functionalized alkyl bromides as the coupling partners with 7-oxa and azabenzonorbornadienes. Under the catalysis of a chiral nickel complex, this desymmetric-ring-opening reaction offers an efficient entry to highly enantioenriched 1,2-dihydronaphthalenes with full cis-selectivity.

Abstract: Summary
New carbon morphologies are desirable in the development of high-performance carbon-based electrocatalysts for cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. In this work, a carbon semi-tube (CST) is successfully constructed by polymerizing m-phenylenediamine (mPDA) using surfactant-assembled micelles as a soft template. After pyrolysis, the CST morphology is retained in the formed N-doped CST (N-CST) catalyst. This mPDA-induced catalyst can provide rich micropores, high N-content, and good conductivity, imbuing it with superior catalytic ORR activity, stability, and methanol tolerance to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. By using such a metal-free N-CST as a cathode catalyst, an alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cell exhibits a maximum power density of about 200 mW cm−2. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that high curvature can be greatly conducive to the excellent catalytic ORR activity by the induced strong OOH∗ adsorption on active sites through a strong dipole-electric field interaction.

Abstract: Structured spectrally selective emitters show good spectral performance in thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems, but most of them cannot maintain good spectral emittance at high temperatures as expected. A Mo-doped HfO2 monolayer structure was proposed to improve the thermal stability of the structured emitters. A simulation model based on the transfer matrix method and effective medium theory was used to design the doped monolayer emitters. Thermal annealing and characterization measurements were conducted to investigate the proposed emitter after 1273 K–1473 K thermal annealing, and a TPV system model was built to evaluate their spectral performance after thermal annealing. The results revealed that 20% Mo doping can improve the spectral performance of a 90 nm HfO2 monolayer structure, making the spectral efficiency up to 60.93% at 1273 K. Due to the combined action of the Mo oxidation, grain growth and phase transition of HfO2 during thermal annealing, the formation of holes and Mo oxides were observed. Consequently, the spectral emittance of the doped emitters changed. Nevertheless, no obvious decline in the system efficiency (approximately 1%) of the TPV system with the doped emitter after 1273K thermal annealing for 12 h was observed. The proposed Mo-doped HfO2 monolayer emitter shows good spectral performance compared with the undoped one. The investigation of the thermal degradation of the proposed emitters can lay a foundation for promoting their applications of TPV systems.

Abstract: The realization of ternary alloys by atomic substitution of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is an effective solution to modulate the optoelectronic properties of 2D materials. The MoxW1-xS2 and MoS2xSe2(1-x) (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) alloys with high stability are established and their electronic, optical and photocatalytic performances are systematically investigated based on the first-principles calculations. Our results indicate that the MoxW1-xS2 and MoS2xSe2(1-x) alloys remain direct bandgaps and optical adsorption has excellent ability to capture ultraviolet and visible light. Suitable bandgap at HSE06 level (>1.23 eV) and band edges satisfy the conditions of photocatalytic water splitting under acidic or neutral solutions. Biaxial strain can enhance the alloys direct bandgap ranges. The introductions of W and S in MoS2 and MoSe2 monolayers cause their intrinsic electronic properties to change. The bandgap values, effective masses and work functions as well as optical adsorption properties of the MoxW1-xS2 and MoS2xSe2(1-x) show different behaviors due to the d-d, p-p and d-p orbitals hybridization between Mo, W, S and Se atoms. The absorption coefficients of Mo0·5W0·5S2 and MoS1·5Se0.5 are significantly higher theirs pure binary TMDs. The work provides a valuable theoretical guidance of TMDs alloys application in 2D flexible photoelectric devices and photocatalytic water splitting.

Abstract: Calcium-based thermochemical energy storage is essential for high-temperature solar energy utilization. However, performance decay is inevitable in repeated calcination/carbonation cycles, even for modified materials. In this study, the effects of synergistic sintering factors on performance decay are investigated, including chemical reaction, temperature and CO2 atmosphere. More importantly, rather than complicating the initial preparation process of the anti-sintering composites to achieve higher stability, a regeneration method is proposed to repair the nanopores of sintered composites and recover their performances. After using citric acid to dissolve materials with heavily sintered morphologies and reconstruct their porous structures, the energy storage densities of both the co-doped and benchmark materials increase by 2–4 times. The regenerated Al/Mg co-doped composite also shows high cyclic stability in subsequent long-term cycles. Furthermore, DFT calculations illustrate the strong atomic interaction between CaO and dopants. The economic analysis reveals that the regeneration costs of the co-doped composites are approximately one-half of their synthesis costs, making them a cost-efficient choice for long-term industrial application. This work expands the limited perspectives of current modification research on improving cyclic stability. It can guide the actual industrial applications of thermochemical energy storage, thus enhancing material reutilization and realizing costs reduction.

Abstract: Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are a group of inherited metabolic diseases mainly caused by a deficiency of lysosomal hydrolases, resulting in a gradual accumulation of non-degraded substrates in different tissues causing the characteristic clinical manifestations of such disorders. Confirmatory tests of suspected LSD individuals include enzymatic and genetic testing. A well-oriented clinical suspicion can improve the cost-effectiveness of confirmatory tests and reduce the time expended to achieve the diagnosis. Thus, this work aims to retrospectively study the influence of clinical orientation on the diagnostic yield of enzymatic tests in LSD by retrieving clinical, biochemical, and genetic data obtained from subjects with suspicion of LSD. Our results suggest that the clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis and the initial clinical suspicion can have a great impact on the diagnostic yield of enzymatic tests, and that clinical orientation performed in specialized clinical departments can contribute to improve it. In addition, the analysis of enzymatic tests as the first step in the diagnostic algorithm can correctly guide subsequent confirmatory genetic tests, in turn increasing their diagnostic yield. In summary, our results suggest that initial clinical suspicion plays a crucial role on the diagnostic yield of confirmatory enzymatic tests in LSD.

Abstract: Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key hallmark of cancer progression. A critical component of ECM remodeling is the assembly of the glycoprotein fibronectin (FN) into insoluble fibrils, which provide a scaffold for invading vascular endothelial cells and escaping cancer cells, as well as a framework for collagen deposition and oncogenic cytokine tethering. FN fibril assembly is induced by Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which was originally identified for its role in malignant transformation. Addition of exogenous TGF-β1 drives FN fibril assembly while also upregulating endogenous TGF-β1 expression and autocrine signaling. In the current study, we sought to determine if autocrine TGF-β1 signaling plays a role in FN fibril formation in either MCF10A mammary epithelial cells, which behave similarly to healthy epithelia, or malignant MDA- MB-231 breast cancer cells. Our results show two interesting findings: first, malignant MDA-MB- 231 cells assemble less FN into fibrils, despite expressing and secreting more soluble FN; second, autocrine TGF-β1 signaling is required for FN fibril formation in MCF10A epithelial cells, even in the presence of exogenous, active TGF-β1. This suggests that autocrine TGF-β1 is signaling through distinct pathways from active exogenous TGF-β1. We hypothesized that this signaling was mediated by interactions between the TGF-β1 latency associated peptide (LAP) and αv integrins; indeed, incubating MCF10As with soluble LAP, even in the absence of the active TGF-β1 ligand, partially recovered FN fibril assembly. Taken together, these data suggests that autocrine TGF-β1 plays a critical role in FN fibril assembly, and this interaction is mediated by LAP-integrin signaling.

Abstract: Introduction
Acute promyelocytic leukemia currently presents an excellent chance of cure with protocols based on all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline or only differentiation agents. However, high early mortality rates continue to be reported
Methods
Between 2000 and 2018, patients were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed by medical records. A modified AIDA protocol, with a 1-year shortening of the treatment duration, reduction in the number of drugs and a strategy to reduce early mortality by the postponement of the initiation of anthracyclines were employed. Overall and event-free survival rates and toxicity were analyzed
Results
Thirty-two patients were enrolled, of whom 56% were female, with a median age of 12 years and 34% belonged to the high-risk group. Two patients had the hypogranular variant and three had another cytogenetic alteration, in addition to the t(15;17). The median start of the first anthracycline dose was 7 days. There were two early deaths (6%) due to central nervous system (CNS) bleeding. All patients achieved molecular remission after the consolidation phase. Two children relapsed and were rescued by arsenic trioxide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) at diagnosis (p = 0.03) was the only factor with survival impact. The five-year event-free survival (EFS) was 84% and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 90%
Conclusion
The survival results were comparable to those found in the AIDA protocol, with a low rate of early mortality in relation to the Brazilian reality.

Abstract: Actin cytoskeleton remodelling drives cell motility, cell to cell contacts, as well as membrane and organelle dynamics. Those cellular activities operate at a particularly high pace in immune cells since these cells migrate through various tissues, interact with multiple cellular partners, ingest microorganisms and secrete effector molecules. The central and multifaceted role of actin cytoskeleton remodelling in sustaining immune cell tasks in humans is highlighted by rare inborn errors of immunity due to mutations in genes encoding proximal and distal actin regulators. In line with the specificity of some of the actin-based processes at work in immune cells, the expression of some of the affected genes, such as WAS, ARPC1B and HEM1 is restricted to the hematopoietic compartment. Exploration of these natural deficiencies highlights the fact that the molecular control of actin remodelling is tuned distinctly in the various subsets of myeloid and lymphoid immune cells and sustains different networks associated with a vast array of specialized tasks. Furthermore, defects in individual actin remodelling proteins are usually associated with partial cellular impairments highlighting the plasticity of actin cytoskeleton remodelling. This review covers the roles of disease-associated actin regulators in promoting the actin-based processes of immune cells. It focuses on the specific molecular function of those regulators across various immune cell subsets and in response to different stimuli. Given the fact that numerous immune-related actin defects have only been characterized recently, we further discuss the challenges lying ahead to decipher the underlying patho-mechanisms.

Abstract: Introduction and hypothesis
Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the absence of a compatible donor. The UCB transplantation has a lower incidence of chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD), but is associated with slower engraftment and slower immune reconstitution, compared to other sources. Dendritic cells (DCs) and Natural Killer cells (NKs) play a central role in the development of GvHD and the graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect, as well as in the control of infectious complications.
Method
We quantified by multiparametric flow cytometry monocytes, lymphocytes, NK cells, and DCs, including their subsets, in UCB samples from 54 healthy newborns and peripheral blood (PB) from 25 healthy adult volunteers.
Results
In the UCB samples, there were higher counts of NK cells 56bright16− (median 0.024 × 109/L), compared to the PB samples (0.012 × 109/L, p < 0.0001), NK 56dim16bright (median 0.446 × 109/L vs. 0.259 × 109/L for PB samples, p = 0.001) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs, median 0.008 × 109/L for UCB samples vs. 0.006 × 109/L for PB samples, p = 0.03). Moreover, non-classic monocyte counts were lower in UCB than in PB (median 0.024 × 109/L vs. 0.051 × 109/L, respectively, p < 0.0001).
Conclusion
In conclusion, there were higher counts of NK cells and pDCs and lower counts of non-classic monocytes in UCB than in PB from healthy individuals. These findings might explain the lower incidence and severity of chronic GvHD, although maintaining the GvL effect, in UCB transplant recipients, compared to other stem cell sources.

Abstract: Introduction
Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) surveys prove beneficial to the transfusion services by providing an insight into the donors and, thus, aiding in mobilizing and retaining voluntary blood donors. We aim to study the knowledge, attitude and practices of donors towards blood donation in a pandemic setting.
Methods
A cross-sectional observational study to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of blood donors was conducted between June to and October 2020. Non-parametric tests (Mann – Whitney U and Kruskal – Wallis) were performed to evaluate the relation of knowledge, attitude and practices overall scores with age group, gender and history of blood donations (first vs. repeat). The Chi-Square test/Fisher's Exact test was used to evaluate the differences in the distribution of Knowledge, Attitude and Practices items within the groups.
Results
A total of 403 of 2,748 individuals who came for whole blood donation participated in the study. The mean age of the study population was 31.1years (SD ± 8.4 range: 18 - 58), with 75% of the donors donating for the first time. The fear of acquiring COVID-19 infection was perceived as a major reason for the eligible population not to donate. The overall knowledge, attitude and practice score among the donors was satisfactory, being 76.14%, with a significant association with age. The overall positive attitude and practices scores of blood donors were 85.48% and 78.04%, respectively.
Conclusion
The KAP scores were satisfactory among the donors. Timely communication of the precautionary measures at blood centers to contain the spread of the COVID-19 infection and effective counseling would help in motivating and retaining blood donors.

Abstract: Summary
Collective motions are the spontaneous emergence of the ordered movement in living systems. Various constructive approaches have been attempted toward understanding the mechanism. However, few studies have been on the motion induced by biomimetic artificial systems based on molecular conversions. In this study, we report an artificial system of oil droplets in surfactant solutions, wherein collective motion and pattern formation occur concurrently, using the conversion of photoresponsive surfactants. Assembly/dispersion of multiple oil droplets and appearance/disappearance of circular patterns around them occur under UV/visible light illumination, respectively. Moreover, whether the assembled droplets move laterally or not depends on the number of droplets, which is considered analogous to biological organisms in response to population density. These phenomena occur because the photoisomerization of surfactants induces the gradient of interfacial tension, generating specific flow fields around droplets. Our results could be useful for understanding the mechanism of life motion in terms of physicochemical aspects.

Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional antimony chalcogenide Sb2(S, Se)3 semiconductor is regarded as one of the most promising photovoltaic materials due to their high optical absorbance coefficient and tunable band gaps. However, current researchers rarely optimize experimental conditions based on characteristics of the Se/S ratio in Sb2(S, Se)3 material and ignore the experimental optimization based on material characteristics. Herein, Sb2(S, Se)3 thin films with three different Se/(Se + S) ratios (Se = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8) are prepared by vapor transport deposition (VTD) based on the temperature sensitivity of the evaporator source. The influence of VTD conditions of Sb2(S, Se)3 on optical properties, electrical properties, film quality, and defect characteristics are investigated through UV absorbance spectra, current density versus voltage (J-V) measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), respectively. It is concluded that the deposition temperature is closely associated with the shift of the band gap. Moreover, different original Se/(Se + S) ratios yield different optimum temperatures (Se = 0.2, 480 °C; Se = 0.5, 500 °C; Se = 0.8, 520 °C), and optimum temperature increase with Se atom ratios. With optimization of the Se/(Se + S) ratio and deposition temperature, a Sb2(S, Se)3 solar cell (Se = 0.8) prepared under 520 °C has optimal light absorbance, longer carrier lifetime, and better film quality, displaying a high efficiency of 6.78%.

Abstract: Platelet-derived microvesicles (PMVs) are the most abundant microvesicles in circulation, originating from blood platelets via membrane blebbing. PMVs act as biological cargo carrying key molecules from platelets, including immunomodulatory molecules, growth factors, clotting molecules, and miRNAs that can regulate recipient cellular functions. Formation and release of PMVs play an essential role in the pathophysiology of vascular diseases such as hemostasis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Platelet activation is considered the critical event in thrombosis, and a growing number of evidence suggests that oxidative stress-mediated signaling plays a significant role in platelet activation. Ca2+ is a notable player in the generation of ROS in platelets. Reports have established that microvesicles exhibit dual nature in redox mechanisms as they possess both pro-oxidant and antioxidant machinery. However, the impact of PMVs and their ROS machinery on platelets is still a limited explored area. Here, we have demonstrated that PMVs mediate platelet activation via intracellular ROS generation. PMVs interacted with platelets and induced calcium-mediated intracellular ROS production via NADPH oxidase (NOX), leading to platelet activation. Our findings will open up new insights into the tangible relationship of PMVs with platelets and will further contribute to the therapeutic aspects of PMVs in vascular injury and tissue remodeling.

Abstract: Introduction
Anemia is a common issue in surgical patients and has been associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as a higher probability of transfusions and longer hospital stay. Therefore, Patient Blood Management programs are actively aiming to achieve early identification and treatment of anemia, previous to the surgery.
Methods and materials
In this study, preoperative hemoglobin within the Blood Order Schedule (BOS) at 16 blood centers in several Brazilian regions were retrospectively evaluated. Data regarding hemoglobin, age, gender and Brazilian regions were further analyzed. Results: From the 20,201 BOSs evaluated, the mean age was 55.65 ± 23.52 years old, with an overall prevalence of preoperative anemia of 60.9%. Women had a lower mean preoperative hemoglobin (11.74 ± 2.84 for women and 12.27 ± 3.06 for men) and higher prevalence of anemia than men (66% of females and 52.2% of males). The individuals over 65 years old and under 18 were the most affected by preoperative anemia. All regions had a high prevalence of preoperative anemia, without any direct association with the Human Development Index.
Conclusion
In summary, upon evaluating the BOS, our study showed a high prevalence of preoperative anemia in all Brazilian regions, regardless of the gender and age group, but that women and individuals less than 18 or over 65 years old have an even higher prevalence of preoperative anemia. This information can identify the institutions in which preoperative anemia is a critical issue and in which new strategies, such as preoperative screening clinics, might be helpful.

Abstract: Summary
Membranes enable the molecular separation by steric exclusion and Donnan repulsion. However, the membrane separation of cesium ion (Cs+) from the alkali-metal ions remains a challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. Here, we explore the implementation of a MoS2 laminate membrane with structural-phase-dependent permeation for Cs+ separation. The Cs+ permeation rate grows 14.5 times as the 1T′-phase MoS2 in the membrane increases from 19.6% to 84.3%, which is ca. an order of magnitude faster than that of the Li+ ions. The ionic dehydration energy and affinity of sulfur-polarization-induced electronegative sites on 1T′-MoS2 to the Cs+ are essential factors resulting in the “knock-on” hopping that describes the preferential delivery of Cs+ in the 1T′-MoS2 channels. Further insight shows that the MoS2 phase structure plays a crucial role in the permeability of Cs+ and as such would bring inspiring thoughts and opportunities in design and fabrication of cutting-edge membranes for alkali-metal ionic separation.

Abstract: Summary
Ligand-ligand interaction is crucial for the surface chemistry, solution properties, and self-assembly processes of colloidal nanocrystals (NCs). Studies on the ligand-ligand interaction are hampered by the disordered and dynamic nature of the surface, the low electron contrast of organic moieties, and the non-characteristic weak intermolecular forces. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) can provide site-specific information on organic ligands and especially the motional behavior of chain segments. Here, we report an advanced SSNMR measurement and modeling strategy to quantify the “dynamic volume” of chain segments. The dynamic volume depicts the accessible space of a chain segment under the confinement of neighboring molecules and is inversely proportional to the intermolecular interaction energy. We show that the calculated ligand-ligand interaction energy determines the solution dispersity and melting transitions of NCs. This dynamic volume concept can be extended beyond experimental measurements and offer semi-empirical predictions of the interaction energies of alkanoate ligands.

Abstract: Summary
Monitoring respiration is vital for personal diagnosis of chronic diseases. However, the existing respiratory sensors have severe limitations, such as single function, finite detection parameters, and lack of smart signal analysis. Here, we present an integrated wearable and low-cost smart respiratory monitoring sensor (RMS) system with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis of respiratory abnormality by detecting multi-parameters of human respiration. Coupling with intelligent analysis and data mining algorithms embedded in a phone app, the lighter system of 7.3 g can acquire real-time self-calibrated parameters, including breathing frequency, apnea hypopnea index (AHI), vital capacity (VC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and other respiratory indexes with an accuracy >95.21%. The data can be wirelessly transferred to the user’s data cloud terminal. The RMS system enables comprehensive multi-physiological parameters analysis for auxiliary diagnosing and classifying diseases, including sleep apnea, rhinitis, and chronic lung diseases, as well as rehabilitation of COVID-19, and exhibits advantages of portable healthcare.

Abstract: Background
Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder. We evaluated the “real-world” effectiveness of first-line imiglucerase on long-term bone outcomes in Italian patients in the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry.
Methods
Patients treated with imiglucerase for ≥2 years and with bone assessments at baseline and during follow-up were selected. Data on bone pain, bone crises, marrow infiltration, avascular necrosis, infarction, lytic lesions, Erlenmeyer flask deformity, bone fractures, mineral density, and imiglucerase dosage were evaluated.
Results
Data on bone manifestations were available for 73 of 229 patients (31.9 %). Bone crises frequency decreased significantly from baseline to the most recent follow-up (p < 0.001), with some improvement observed in bone pain prevalence. Bone pain and bone crises prevalence decreased significantly from baseline at 2 to <4 and 4 to <6 years (all p < 0.05). A low median (25th, 75th percentile) baseline imiglucerase dosage was identified in patients reporting bone pain or bone crises (15.0 [13.7, 30.0] and 22.8 [17.5, 36.0] U/kg once every 2 weeks, respectively).
Conclusion
Our study suggests that the management of GD in Italy, with regards to imiglucerase dosage, is suboptimal and confirms the need for clinicians to monitor and correctly treat bone disease according to best practice guidelines.

Abstract: This work concerns the fabrication of a salt based form-stable phase change composite by employing halloysite nanotube (HNT) as ceramic supporting material (CSM). The HNT has been broadly reported for preparation of low-temperature organic composites but very little has been done in medium and high temperature thermal energy storage fields. Herein we demonstrate for the first time with the use of HNT as skeleton substance for the fabrication of salt composite by cold compression and hot sintering technology. The feasibility of material fabrication is confirmed by evaluating a case containing a salt of sodium nitrate as phase change material and HNT as CSM. The effect of preheating treatment of HNT on the microstructure and phase change behaviours as well as cycling performance of the composite is investigated. The results show that HNT can be wetted by the liquid nitrate salt at elevated temperatures, verifying the viability of the present strategy by using HNT as SSM for the synthesis of salt composite. A stable chemical structure is achieved in the salt-HNT composite, which confirms a preeminent chemical stability and compatibility between the HNT and nitrate salt. The hollow tubular structure of HNT could not only be able to provide extra surface for accommodating liquid salt to form a dense composite, but also strengthen the thermal stability of the nitrate salt. The preheating treatment of HNT at 300 °C and 500 °C respectively causes the occurrence of dehydration and dehydroxylation process, which in turn leads to the morphology and microstructure change of HNT, and hence affects the cycling performance of the composite. In comparison with the composite made from HNT preheated at 500 °C where a serious pulverization and deformation has been observed after 100 thermal cycles, the composite containing HNT preheated at 300 °C presents more stable structure and excellent cycling performance, revealing that the HNT is only suitable for the accommodation of inorganic salt that having application temperature limit less than 500 °C.

Abstract: Microencapsulation technology solves the problems that phase change materials (PCM) are easy to leak, difficult to transport, and vulnerable to contamination. However, the shell materials are mostly organic materials with low thermal conductivity, which limits their specific application in the field of thermal energy storage. In this regard, in order to enhance the thermal conductivity, a novel type of microencapsulated phase change materials (MicroEPCM) based on an n-eicosane core and a phenol-formaldehyde resin shell modified by nano-BN and nano-SiC, respectively, were fabricated via in-situ polymerization method. The effect of the mass fractions (2, 4 and 6 wt%) of nano-additives on the performance of MicroEPCM-BN and MicroEPCM-SiC was systematically investigated. The morphology, chemical structure and thermal properties of modified MicroEPCM were characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD and DSC, respectively, to determine the optimum incorporation of nano-additives. Conclusions are as follows: modified MicroEPCM still had a spherical morphology with an average particle size range of 2–8 μm. Furthermore, the addition of nano-additives significantly improved the thermal conductivity of MicroEPCM, and the thermal conductivity gradually increased with the progressive increase in nano-additives content. MicroEPCM-4%BN and MicroEPCM-6%SiC had the best overall performance with phase change enthalpies of 145.83J/g and 131.30J/g, respectively, and the thermal conductivity increased by 61 % and 97 %, respectively, compared to that of MicroEPCM without nano-additives. They also showed excellent thermal cycling and degradation stability. Consequently, MicroEPCM modified by nano-additives will have great potential for thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Introduction
Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is an emerging treatment option for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) that is a multi-step process involving various stakeholders. Appropriate education on the practical logistics is therefore paramount to ensure treatment success.
Methods
A group of key opinion leaders met to explore the key elements of setting up and running a CAR-T center in Brazil. For each step in the CAR-T cell therapy process, the experts agreed on basic requirements, gave their key recommendations from practical experience, and considered any remaining unanswered questions.
Results
This paper presents best-practice recommendations and advice on how to overcome common challenges for each step in the CAR-T cell therapy process, with a focus on the current situation in Brazil. Key themes throughout the process are collaboration within the multidisciplinary team and with the referring physician, along with communication and education for patients and their caregivers.
Conclusion

Abstract: Introduction
Pre-apheresis peripheral blood CD34+ cell count (PBCD34+) is the most important predictor of good cell mobilization before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, albeit flow cytometry is not always immediately available. Identification of surrogate markers can be useful. The CD34+ cells proliferate after mobilization, resulting in elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and correlating with the PBCD34+ count.
Objective
To determine the LDH cut-off value at which adequate CD34+ cell mobilization is achieved and its diagnostic yield.
Materials and methods
A total of 103 patients who received an autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) between January 2015 and January 2020 were included. Demographic and laboratory characteristics were obtained, including complete blood count, pre-apheresis PBCD34+ and LDH levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to identify the optimal serum LDH activity cut-off points for ≥ 2 and ≥ 4 × 106 cells/kg post-mobilization CD34+ count and their diagnostic yield.
Results
A post-mobilization serum LDH cut-off value of 462 U/L yielded a sensitivity (Se) = 86.8% (positive predictive value [PPV] = 72.7%), a pre- and post-mobilization serum LDH difference cut-off value of 387 U/L, an Se = 45.7% (PPV = 97%) and an LDH ratio of 2.46, with an Se = 47.1% (PPV = 97%) for an optimal mobilization count (CD34+ ≥ 4 × 106).
Conclusion
The LDH measurement represents a fast and affordable way to predict PBCD34+ mobilization in cases where flow cytometry is not immediately available. According to the LDH diagnostic yield, it could be used as a surrogate marker in transplant centers, supporting the CD34+ count, which remains the gold standard.

Abstract: Organismal aging is impacted by the deterioration of tissue turnover mechanisms due, in part, to the decline in stem cell function. This decline can be related to mitochondrial dysfunction and underlying energetic defects that, in concert, help drive biological aging. Thus, mitochondria have been described as a potential interventional target to hinder the loss of stem cell robustness, and subsequently, decrease tissue turnover decline and age-associated pathologies. In this review, we focused our analysis on the most recent literature on mitochondria and stem cell aging and discuss the potential benefits of targeting mitochondria in preventing stem cell dysfunction and thus influencing aging.

Abstract: Introduction
Patients with β-thalassemia major (β-TM) are at risk of developing abnormal lipid profiles. Lipid abnormalities, in turn, have a potential role in the pathogenesis of some clinical aspects of thalassemia
Objectives
To evaluate lipid levels and atherogenic indices in β-TM patients compared to healthy children and for any association between lipid levels, lipid peroxidation and inflammatory biomarkers
Methods
This case–control study was carried out on 79 patients with β-TM, aged 6 to 16 years, registered at the Basrah Center for Hereditary Blood Diseases and 85 age- and sex-matched apparently healthy children and adolescents. Complete blood count, serum lipids and ferritin, liver function tests, C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and serum malondialdehyde (MDA) were evaluated
Results
Patients with β-TM had significantly lower hemoglobin (Hb), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) and significantly higher very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides (TGs), LDL/HDL ratio, MDA, hs-CRP, total serum bilirubin (TSB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than the control group (p < 0.05). A bivariate analysis revealed that TC has a significant positive association with Hb. The TG has a significant negative association with Hb and a positive association with serum ferritin. Furthermore, MDA, TG, TSB, ALT and AST were significantly positively correlated with serum ferritin (p < 0.05)
Conclusions
Atherogenic dyslipidemia, defined as a high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio and high TG level, is common among pediatric β-TM patients, it is associated with iron overload and places patients at an increased cardiovascular risk.

Abstract: Introduction
Approximately 55.52% of the Indian population had been fully vaccinated by Jan. 2022, since its first roll out on January 16, 2021. A few concerns were raised concerning the Covishield vaccination related to thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Apheresis-derived platelet concentrates are frequently required in a plethora of clinical situations and post-vaccination decrement of platelet counts might lead to increased deferral of the platelet-pheresis donors. Objectives. The aim of the study was to discover the effect of the Covishield vaccination on deferral rates of plateletpheresis donors.
Methods
Blood samples were collected from the potential platelet donors for the completion of the standard questionnaire for the complete blood count. The data collected were tabulated in the MS Excel spreadsheet and the biostatistical analysis was performed with the SPSS v23. A p-value of < 0.05 was taken as significant. We compared this data with age- and sex-matched controls.
Results
The mean age of cases and controls was 29.69 ± 8.57 and 30.15 ± 7.11, respectively. There was a significant difference in platelet counts of cases (188496.35 ± 72065.66/cumm) and controls (269524.50 ± 53981.60/cumm). Furthermore, donors who received one dose had higher platelet counts of 248676.47 ± 80075.24/cumm than those who received both doses of vaccine (179970.83 ± 66773.73/cumm) . The difference in deferral rates between the two groups was remarkable (34.7% vs. 0.9%, with the p-value < 0.001).
Conclusion
Vaccination certainly increased the deferral rates of plateletpheresis donors due to low platelet counts. Average platelet counts were low in fully vaccinated individuals, however, the platelets returned to normal counts as the post-vaccination days progressed.

Abstract: The reversible semiconductor-to-metal transition of vanadium dioxide (VO2) makes VO2-based coatings a promising candidate for thermochromic smart windows, reducing the energy consumption of buildings. We report on a scalable sputter deposition technique for fast preparation of strongly thermochromic YSZ/V0.986W0.014O2/YSZ coatings, where YSZ denotes Y-stabilized ZrO2, on conventional soda-lime glass at a relatively low substrate surface temperature (350 °C) and without any substrate bias voltage. The thermochromic V0.986W0.014O2 layers and the antireflection YSZ layers were deposited using a controlled high-power impulse magnetron sputtering of a single V–W and Zr–Y target, respectively. A coating design utilizing a second-order interference in the YSZ layers was applied to increase both the integral luminous transmittance (Tlum) and the modulation of the solar energy transmittance (ΔTsol). We present the phase composition (X-ray diffraction) and microstructure (high-resolution transmission electron microscopy) of the coatings and their optical properties (spectrophotometry and spectroscopic ellipsometry). The YSZ/V0.986W0.014O2/YSZ coatings exhibit a transition temperature of 33–35 °C with Tlum = 64.5% and ΔTsol = 7.8% for a V0.986W0.014O2 thickness of 37 nm, and Tlum = 46.1% and ΔTsol = 13.2% for a V0.986W0.014O2 thickness of 67 nm. The results constitute an important step to a cost-effective and high-rate preparation of large-area thermochromic VO2-based coatings for future smart-window applications.

Abstract: In the present study, novel in-situ oxidation precipitation of ferrous hydroxide method is used to synthesized Fe3O4 nanoparticles and Polyethylene glycol 200 is used for covalent functionalization. Various characterizations tests (FESEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, HRTEM) were performed, and the Polyethylene glycol treated Iron oxides functionalization was confirmed. Thermal conductivity, density, specific heat, and viscosity were experimentally assessed and validated using the correlations that were available. The corresponding improvements in thermophysical characteristics were 13.35%, 0.06%, 0.37%, and 20.9% at 0.1 wt% and 35°C. UV–vis spectroscopy and Zeta protentional was used to check the stability of nanofluids and found that nanofluid was stable for 30 days. A flat plate solar collector was experimentally installed, and the thermal performance of collector was calculated using ferrofluid under ASHRAE standard 93–2003 at different heat flux intensities (597,775,988 W/m2), mass flow rates ((0.0133, 0.0200, 0.0266 kg/s), inlet fluid temperature (30–50°C) and weight concentrations (0.025,0.05,0.075,0.1%). The highest thermal efficiency enhancement of 13.83% was noticed. Moreover, the ANSYS-CFD model was used for the numerical analysis of the thermal performance of flat plate collector at the same environmental conditions, and a maximum difference of 8.33% at 0.1 wt% was noticed in comparison with experimental data.

Abstract: Summary
Latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) shielded in macrophages is hard to detect and eradicate, causing lethal respiratory failure and systemic inflammation. Here, we synthesize an aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) with metabolic labeling and in situ photodynamic scavenging functions via click chemistry. By participating in cytoderm peptidoglycan biosynthesis, the wash-free AIEgen presents quick (10 min) and selective metabolic labeling to live Mtb and obtains 50-fold better detection sensitivity of tuberculosis compared with acid-fast bacilli (AFBs). Notably, the AIEgen demonstrates accurate (>96%), sensitive (>96%), and specific (100%) clinical tuberculosis diagnosis using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and sputum samples. Upon low-power light irradiation, the AIEgen generates lethal-dose reactive oxygen species (ROS) to break the bacterial cytoderm and significantly improves the sensitivity of Mtb to rifampicin via photodynamic ablation. The AIEgen is a clinically oriented diagnostic for tuberculosis mass screening in regions with low income and a high tuberculosis burden and shows excellent potential for photodynamic ablation of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

Abstract: Introduction
The knowledge of clinicians regarding blood transfusion services may impact patient care and transfusion outcome. The wide variation in transfusion practices among clinicians leads to inappropriate blood product usage and jeopardizes patient safety. Hence, this survey study aimed to assess knowledge, attitude and practice among the residents and interns of safe blood transfusion.
Methods
The online survey was based on self-administered questionnaires of three sections: 1. Demography; 2. Knowledge, and; 3. Attitude and Practice. One point was assigned for the correct response of each question in every section. The knowledge score was further categorized into three categories, depending on the points obtained. The participants were also divided into four groups, depending on their experience. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to determine the difference of knowledge and practice scores in three designated groups of residents and interns. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.
Result
A total of 247 residents and interns participated in this study. Thirteen participants had an incomplete response. Out of 234 participants, Senior Residents (SR), Junior Residents (JR), and interns were 70, 96 and 68 participants, respectively. The knowledge scores of interns were significantly low, as compared to SRs and JRs. Practice scores of interns were also significantly low, compared to the JRs. However, most of the residents and interns (85%) were aware of the pre-transfusion testing.
Conclusion
Therefore, the mandatory incorporation of the transfusion medicine subject in the undergraduate curriculum can help the young budding doctors to better implement the patient blood management.

Abstract: Bifacial passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) currently have the highest share in the photovoltaic market. However, heterojunction (HJT) and tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells are expected to gain significant market share shortly. Despite technological advancements, concerns about the reliability of HJT and TOPCon technologies when deployed in the field still need to be addressed. This work investigates the impact of sodium chloride (NaCl) on damp-heat-induced degradation in bifacial HJT, PERC, and TOPCon solar cells by exposing the solar cells to NaCl before damp heat (DH) testing. It is found that among all investigated cell technologies, TOPCon solar cells degrade the most with maximum power (Pmax) loss of up to ∼75%rel, followed by HJT (Pmax drops ∼50%rel), and PERC cells (Pmax drops only ∼10%rel) after 20 h of DH testing, mainly attributed to an increase in Rs on the front side of TOPCon cells, both sides of HJT cells and the rear side of PERC cells. The front of the PERC and the rear of the TOPCon solar cell are found to be stable. The rise in Rs is attributed to the corrosion of the metal contact, which is caused by a high amount of Na+ and Cl− ions penetrating the metal contact. This corrosion leads to increased porosity, detachment of the contact from the silicon interface, and increased recombination loss in some cases. These results are crucial for all cell technologies as they highlight the potential failures that could occur in the field. Na+ and/or Cl− ions are common contaminants present in solar glass, human fingerprints, soldering flux, rainwater, soil/dust, and seawater. During field operation, these ions have the potential to penetrate and directly interact with solar cells. In our view, the preferred solution is for the solar cells to be corrosion-resistant, which can be rapidly assessed using the method presented in this work.

Abstract: Summary
The energy demand for heating and cooling interior space contributes to rising global emissions. Windows are responsible for energy loss by heat exchange between the interior and outdoors. Scientists have been focusing on developing thermochromic materials for smart windows to modulate solar irradiation to reduce energy demand for interior comfort. Most studies show visible-light modulation when the temperature rises but fail to show privacy protection at night when the temperature drops. Here, we report a versatile user-controlled thermoresponsive window integrated with a transparent heater. The sandwiched poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) in a window enables powerless reversible transition between the transparent and opaque states at its activation temperature. The heater offers dual functionalities: a privacy switch to darken the window on demand and an extended spectral reflectivity in the infrared. A window that reflects heat helps reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling while preserving the transparency for visible light to illuminate the interior.

Abstract: Over the past few years, Th17 cells is considered a key player in osteoporosis pathogenesis. Although extensively studied in murine models, comprehensive Th17 cell characterization in osteoporotic women is elusive. We thus aimed to examine peripheral Th17 cells frequency and phenotypes in healthy and osteoporotic women. Our results demonstrated that Th17 cells were primarily CD4+CD45RA−CCR7−HALDR+CCR6lowT-cells. Compared to Pre-N, Post-L showed increased proportion of Th17 with concomitant decrease in Th1 cells. The Th17 cells frequency in effector memory CD4+ T cells was significantly elevated in Post-N with a decrease of Th1 cells in effector memory subsets compared to Pre-N and Post-L. Both Post-N and Post-L had decreased frequency of dual positive Th1-Th17 cells and increased HLA-DR expression on Th17 cells compared to Pre-N. Thus, our study demonstrates increased Th17 cells frequency and reduced Th1 cells frequency with effector memory phenotype in postmenopausal women with estrogen insufficiency and correlates with aging process.

Abstract: Summary
Catalyst fragmentation behavior and polymer particle morphology evolution are two critical factors for obtaining high-quality polyethylene (PE). However, for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), emerging catalysts for ethylene polymerization, systematic studies related to their fragmentation behavior and PE morphology evolution from early stages are still missing. Here, we provide a strategy by using MOF thin films as 2D model catalysts to elucidate PE growth and fragmentation behavior of MOFs in ethylene polymerization. The morphological evolution and particle expansion processes of the formed PE are observed as a function of polymerization time, which is linked to the morphology of MOFs and the crystallinity of produced PE. Moreover, the fragmentation process is visualized, revealing a combination of layer-by-layer and bisectioning fragmentation modes at very early stages and a dominant bisectioning fragmentation later. The desirable fragmentation behavior of MIL-101 (Cr) and PE growth and morphology indicate the potential of MOFs in ethylene polymerization.

Abstract: Tandem solar cells, with monolithically integrated wide bandgap top cell and narrow bandgap bottom cell, have the potential to surpass the Shockley-Queisser limit in single junction solar cells. Antimony (Sb) based compound semiconductors are promising candidates for tandem photovoltaics due to their wide range of tunable bandgaps, non-toxicity, low-cost and natural abundance. In this study, we use numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of a novel two-terminal (2T) all-inorganic tandem solar cell. The top cell consists of AlSb as the main absorber layer, which has a bandgap of 1.60 eV. The bottom cell has Al0.15Ga0.85Sb absorber having a bandgap of 0.852 eV. The short-circuit current density of the top cell matches that of the bottom cell when the Al0.15Ga0.85Sb thickness is 370 nm. The defect densities of the top and the bottom cell absorber layers are optimized to maximize the performance of the tandem cell. Under current matching conditions, the optimized 2T tandem cell yields a high-open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.91 V leading to a power conversion efficiency of 40.95%. The results presented here can aid in the development of the next generation of highly efficient all-inorganic tandem solar cells.
