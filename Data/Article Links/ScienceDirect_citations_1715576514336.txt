Abstract: The small GTPase Ras is frequently mutated in cancer and a driver of tumorigenesis. The recent years have shown great progress in drug-targeting Ras and understanding how it operates on the plasma membrane. We now know that Ras is non-randomly organized into proteo-lipid complexes on the membrane, called nanoclusters. Nanoclusters contain only a few Ras proteins and are necessary for the recruitment of downstream effectors, such as Raf. If tagged with fluorescent proteins, the dense packing of Ras in nanoclusters can be analyzed by Förster/ fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Loss of FRET can therefore report on decreased nanoclustering and any process upstream of it, such as Ras lipid modifications and correct trafficking. Thus, cellular FRET screens employing Ras-derived fluorescence biosensors are potentially powerful tools to discover chemical or genetic modulators of functional Ras membrane organization. Here we implement fluorescence anisotropy-based homo-FRET measurements of Ras-derived constructs labelled with only one fluorescent protein on a confocal microscope and a fluorescence plate reader. We show that homo-FRET of both H-Ras- and K-Ras-derived constructs can sensitively report on Ras-lipidation and -trafficking inhibitors, as well as on genetic perturbations of proteins regulating membrane anchorage. By exploiting the switch I/II-binding Ras-dimerizing compound BI-2852, this assay is also suitable to report on the engagement of the K-Ras switch II pocket by small molecules such as AMG 510. Given that homo-FRET only requires one fluorescent protein tagged Ras construct, this approach has significant advantages to create Ras-nanoclustering FRET-biosensor reporter cell lines, as compared to the more common hetero-FRET approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Electrocatalytic conversion of dinitrogen and carbon dioxide directly to urea by C–N coupling could be an eco-friendly alternative to the current synthetic route, which uses ammonia produced via the Haber-Bosch process. Recent experiments have shown that bimetallic catalysts with defective configurations can be synthesized. However, diverse possible element combinations and unclear mechanisms are challenges in their rational design. Here, in-depth calculations are performed to investigate the catalytic performance of a series of bimetals anchored on N-doped graphene. Through a two-step screening strategy and investigation of free energy, a Ti-Co@NC catalyst is found to exhibit an ultra-low onset potential of 0.23 V, catalyzing the reaction efficiently. Furthermore, molecular electrostatic potential maps and dual descriptor diagrams reveal that CO prefers to tilt-attack ∗N2 to promote C–N coupling effectively. The reaction process can be enhanced by controlling the transfer of electrons between two metallic sites. These results will increase the understanding of C–N coupling in urea electrosynthesis and inspire rational catalyst design.

Abstract: Summary
Direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 plays a key role in most 1.5°C climate scenarios. The low concentration of CO2 in ambient air results in high contactor volumes, air flow rates, and energy requirements. Here, we investigate a DAC system based on the carbonation of Ca(OH)2 hollow bricks piled in stacks that move counter-currently with respect to the air flow. Capture efficiencies of 50% can be obtained with a contactor approximately 10 m deep, with a pressure drop below 200 Pa at air velocities of 3–4 m/s inside the brick holes. To capture 1 Mt-CO2/year, DAC cost approaches 251 and 131 $/t-CO2 (without contingencies) for a first and an nth-of-a-kind system, respectively, relying on emerging technologies to decarbonize the lime and cement industries. If the carbonated bricks find a value as construction materials, breakthrough decreases in costs can be achieved.

Abstract: Summary
The centrosymmetric CdO is not generally considered piezoelectric. Here, we demonstrate the observation of piezoelectric, photovoltaic, and rectification effects in (111)-oriented CdO films. The piezoelectric, photovoltaic, and rectification performances are enhanced with an increase in the (111)-texture coefficient of CdO films. Moreover, these effects are decreased by applying an external force and eventually disappear. An electric field is produced in the (111)-oriented CdO film by spontaneous polarization (spontaneous electric field [Es]). The piezoelectric, photovoltaic, and rectification effects originate from the Es. We thus present piezoelectric, photovoltaic, and rectification atomic mechanisms. The CdO film piezoelectric generator corresponds to a flat-plate capacitor, the compression induces discharge, and the release of pressure is a charging process. This work reveals the nature of the piezoelectric effect and the bulk photovoltaic effect and challenges the current piezoelectric theory. The polar-oriented films can be used to produce high-performance piezoelectric and optoelectronic materials and devices.

GSK-3 inhibition reverts mesenchymal transition in primary human corneal endothelial cells,

Abstract: Human corneal endothelial cells are organized in a tight mosaic of hexagonal cells and serve a critical function in maintaining corneal hydration and clear vision. Regeneration of the corneal endothelial tissue is hampered by its poor proliferative capacity, which is partially retrieved in vitro, albeit only for a limited number of passages before the cells undergo mesenchymal transition (EnMT). Although different culture conditions have been proposed in order to delay this process and prolong the number of cell passages, EnMT has still not been fully understood and successfully counteracted. In this perspective, we identified herein a single GSK-3 inhibitor, CHIR99021, able to revert and avoid EnMT in primary human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnCs) from old donors until late passages in vitro (P8), as shown from cell morphology analysis (circularity). In accordance, CHIR99021 reduced expression of α-SMA, an EnMT marker, while restored endothelial markers such as ZO-1, Na+/K+ ATPase and N-cadherin, without increasing cell proliferation. A further analysis on RNA expression confirmed that CHIR99021 induced downregulation of EnMT markers (α-SMA and CD44), upregulation of the proliferation repressor p21 and revealed novel insights into the β-catenin and TGFβ pathways intersections in HCEnCs. The use of CHIR99021 sheds light on the mechanisms involved in EnMT, providing a substantial advantage in maintaining primary HCEnCs in culture until late passages, while preserving the correct morphology and phenotype. Altogether, these results bring crucial advancements towards the improvement of the corneal endothelial cells based therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon nanotubes are promising electrode materials for electrochemical capacitive energy storage. Here, we report a host-guest strategy to construct one-dimensional heterostructures by encapsulating redox-active polyoxometalate molecular clusters within single-walled carbon nanotubes. The electron transfer from nanotubes to clusters loosens π−π stacking of carbon nanotubes, leading to improved dispersion and higher electrical double-layer capacity. Besides, the nanoconfinement effect of carbon nanotubes not only facilitates electron transfer for inner redox-active polyoxometalates but also protects them from chemical degradation. Typically, the hybrid redox material delivers a high specific capacity of 328.6 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1 in phosphoric acid electrolyte and a prominent rate capability with 82.1% capacity retention at 500 mV s−1. The assembled supercapacitor exhibits maximum energy density of 33.4 Wh kg−1 and long-term stability with 91.3% of the initial capacity retained over 10,000 cycles. This study underlines the potential of redox-driven encapsulation strategies in developing high-performance energy storage materials.

Abstract: Summary
The design of synthetic inorganic catalysts mimicking the first coordination spheres of enzymatic cofactors often results in lower yields and selectivity than their biological counterparts. In this study, we exploit Kohn-Sham density functional methods to compare the reaction profiles of four single iron-based catalysts for the direct oxidation of methane to methanol: two biomimetic models based on two enzymes (cytochrome P450 and taurine dioxygenase [TauD]) and two synthetic reticular frameworks (iron-BEA zeolite and tri-iron oxo-center-based metal-organic framework). Both the biomimetic and inorganic catalysts show almost zero selectivity toward methanol for methane conversions >1% at ambient temperature. This study highlights that iron’s first coordination shell can influence selectivity toward methanol but to a limited extent. In the absence of methanol protection strategies, high selectivity can be reached only by mimicking the reaction microenvironment of enzymes beyond the first coordination shell of iron.

Abstract: Summary
Reducing the defects located at the interfaces between the perovskite layer and charge transport layers is critical to improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is difficult to manipulate both interfaces simultaneously with synergistic beneficial effects. Here, we report a strategy of one-pot surface and buried interface manipulation of 3D perovskite films by introducing two diammonium Ni and Cu porphyrins. The Ni porphyrin (NiP) and Cu porphyrin (CuP) act as bulky cations to yield 2D perovskite layers at the top-buried interfaces of 3D perovskites. The porphyrin-based 2D perovskite layer facilitates charge transport significantly suppressing non-radiative recombination. The device based on CuP&NiP manipulation yields an improved efficiency of up to 24.2% along with long-term overall stability. This work provides an approach for one-pot surface and buried interface manipulation of perovskite films by functional porphyrins to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs.

Abstract: Introduction
Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the long-term consolidation treatment for various hematological malignancies. The collection of hematopoietic stem cell yield is critical to successful ASCTs, but not always achieved due to hematopoietic stem cell mobilization failure (HSCMF). Details regarding the cell collection and outcomes of those who fail mobilization are still lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to yield data on clinical outcomes and cellular products after HSCMF.
Methods
Retrospective, unicentric study assessing clinical outcomes and characteristics of collected progenitor cells. The data were collected from patient databases. The results were reported in median, rates and percentages and absolute values. Patients older than 18 years of age at the time of mobilization and HSCMF were included.
Results
Five hundred ninety-nine patients underwent mobilization protocols. Thirty-five (5.8%) of them failed in the mobilization and fourteen (40%) died. Median time to death was eight months. Disease progression and infection were responsible for all deaths. Median relapse-free survival was 6.5 months (20 patients, 57%). Seven (20%) survivors were receiving salvage therapy and five (14%) were being followed clinically. Six (20.6%) participants underwent collection by apheresis, with insufficient cell collection. The median quantity of peripheral CD34+ cells in those patients was 10.5/mm3. The median CD34+ quantity collected was 0.86 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg.
Conclusions
The mobilization failure was associated with limited survival. Nonetheless, collected products offered perspectives for ex vivo expansion. Further studies should investigate the feasibility of expanding collected CD34+ cells to use as grafts for ASCT.

Abstract: Summary
Radical-containing materials have received renewed interest due to their charge-conducting properties. However, most work focuses on macromolecules, while less attention has been paid to radical-containing small molecules. Here, we quantify the electrical conductivity in two organic radical single crystals and demonstrate that a subtle change in atomic connectivity drastically alters the macroscopic electronic properties of the materials. One radical crystal has an electrical conductivity of ∼3 S m−1, which is the among the highest values for nonconjugated radical conductors over a 1 μm scale. However, the other radical crystal has a 1,000-fold lower conductivity, despite their extremely similar molecular structures. The temperature-dependent conductivity follows the variable range hopping mechanism for both radical crystals, and the difference in effective charge mobility is the reason for the conductivity difference. These results present a clear picture of the design rules and charge transport mechanism for radical-based small-molecule materials.

Abstract: Summary
Developing in situ-grown perovskite single-crystal thin films (PeSCTFs) on transport layers is essential to achieve high-performance optoelectronic devices. However, it remains a challenge to grow PeSCTFs in situ with a high area-to-thickness ratio and low trap density. Here, we propose a new strategy of gradient heating nucleation and room-temperature growth. Gradient heating nucleation helps to overcome the high nucleation energy barrier and reduce the number of crystal nuclei, and room-temperature growth helps reduce the crystal growth rate and aims at an orderly deposition and diffusion of atoms for in situ growth of PeSCTFs with high quality. Consequently, the fabricated FAPbBr3 PeSCTF achieves a record area-to-thickness ratio of 1.84 × 105 mm and a low trap density of 3.76 × 108 cm−3. Moreover, the proposed strategy is also shown to be a universal method for in situ growth of other kinds of PeSCTFs on multiple transport layers.

Abstract: Summary
Similar to chameleon skins, colloidal mechanochromic photonic crystals (MPCs) have been receiving increasing attention due to their capability of adjusting colors by force. However, their applications are hindered by poor sensitivity (<1 nm/kPa or nm/%), responsiveness (<1 nm/ms), and tuning range of wavelength (Δλ < 180 nm), mainly due to the small surface-to-surface distance (Ds-s) between neighboring particles. Here, we have fabricated supersensitive SiO2/water-hydroxyethyl acrylate MPC hydrogels with large Ds-s and thus extreme sensitivity (106.9 nm/kPa and 3.7 nm/%), fast responsiveness (11.3 nm/ms), broad Δλ (340 nm), and good reversibility (>100 times) by swelling non-closely packed structures combined with a unique interface etching-induced swelling mechanism. The unique compositions, structures, and swelling mechanisms are the keys to precisely regulating the Ds-s and mechanochromic properties. These MPC hydrogels can monitor the small jump pressure of frogs dynamically, visually, and instantly, showing their potential applications in sensing and wearable devices.

Abstract: Introduction
Serum levels of sCD40L, sCD40 and sCD62P were evaluated in sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients aged between 2 and 16 years with normal transcranial Doppler (TCD) and no stroke (G1, n = 24); in SCA patients with abnormal TCD (G2, n = 16); in SCA patients with a previous history of stroke (G3, n = 8), and; in healthy controls (aged 2 to 13 years; n = 26).
Results
The levels of sCD40L were significantly higher in the G1, G2 and G3 groups, compared to controls (p = 0.0001, p < 0.0002 and p = 0.004, respectively). Among patients with SCA, higher levels of sCD40L were found in the G3 group, compared to the G2 group (p = 0.03). In the sCD62P analysis, high levels in G3, compared to G1 (p = 0.0001), G2 (p = 0.03) and G4 (p = 0.01), and G2 also had high levels, compared to G1 (p = 0.04). The G1 patients had a higher sCD40L/sCD62P ratio, compared to G2 (p = 0.003) and controls (p < 0.0001). The sCD40L/sCD40 ratios were higher in G1, G2 and G3, compared to controls (p < 0.0001, p = 0.008 and p = 0.002, respectively).
Conclusion
It was concluded that the combination of TCD abnormality, associated with levels of sCD40L and sCD62P, may contribute to a better assessment of the risk for stroke in pediatric SCA patients. Favor pedir para os autores corrigirem esta frase, pois NÃO é uma sentença completa em inglês: Our data suggest that decreased values of the s[LSM1] CD40L/sCD62P ratio involving two inflammatory mediators produced in platelet activation, being unprecedented in the literature.

Abstract: Summary
Development of sustainable adhesives requires simultaneous realization of high strength and excellent ductility but remains challenging. Here, we prepare furan-ring-containing biomimetic multiphase polymers to afford fully sustainable, strong, and supertough adhesives, showing that the key factors of these adhesives are the asymmetric structure of the aromatic furan ring and its oxygenated nature. The adhesives exhibit several beneficial structural features: easy phase separation, dynamic hard phases capable of rupturing and re-forming to dissipate energy, strain-induced orientation and recrystallization, and multiple oxygen binding to substrates. All of these factors act in synergy to result in high adhesion strength (12.1 MPa), exceptional toughness (work of debonding >13,000 N m−1), excellent temperature adaptability, and impressive solvent resistance. Thus, the present work provides new perspectives on the design of strong, tough, and fully sustainable adhesives.

Abstract: Summary
Transforming dense MXene (Ti3C2Tx) films into lightweight 3D porous frameworks is crucial for practical applications of 2D MXene materials. However, traditional foaming technologies may compromise the intrinsic properties of MXene films, such as foldability, which is essential for future applications. Here, we report an approach using a common acid-base neutralization reaction to rapidly foam MXene films. The acid solution triggers the generation of porous structures in alkalized MXene films, resulting in a 3D porous MXene film with good foldability, excellent absolute shielding efficiency (25,445 dB cm2 g−1), electrochemical capacitance, and infrared stealth properties. Furthermore, the acid-base neutralization reaction strategy can be applied to foam other 2D material films, such as graphene oxide, broadening the potential for developing innovative foaming modes of 2D materials. This work enhances our understanding of MXene film foaming and lays the foundation for further applications of MXenes.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of superconducting nickelates reignited hope for elucidating the high-Tc superconductivity mechanism in isostructural cuprates. While the superconducting gap opens up on a single band of the quasi-2D Fermi surface in the cuprates, the nickelates are known to have a 3D nature of an electronic structure with a multi-band. This raises a serious question about the role of the 2D nature for the high-Tc superconductivity. Here, employing GW + dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), we report the Kondo effect driven by the strong correlation of Nd-4f and Ni-3d electrons emerging at low temperature. The Kondo effect modifies the topology of the Fermi surface, leading to a 3D multi-band nature. Remarkably, the Kondo effect is easily destroyed by lattice modulation, leading to the quasi-2D nature. Our findings could provide a new perspective for explaining the inconsistent occurrence of superconductivity and distinct electrical resistivity behavior between NdNiO2 bulk and films, calling for an experimental measure of the Fermi surface of bulk NdNiO2.

Abstract: To study processes related to weightlessness in ground-based cell biological research, a theoretically assumed microgravity environment is typically simulated using a clinostat – a small laboratory device that rotates cell culture vessels with the aim of averaging out the vector of gravitational forces. Here, we report that the rotational movement during fast clinorotation induces complex fluid motions in the cell culture vessel, which can trigger unintended cellular responses. Specifically, we demonstrate that suppression of myotube formation by 2D-clinorotation at 60 rpm is not an effect of the assumed microgravity but instead is a consequence of fluid motion. Therefore, cell biological results from fast clinorotation cannot be attributed to microgravity unless alternative explanations have been rigorously tested and ruled out. We consider two control experiments mandatory, i) a static, non-rotating control, and ii) a control for fluid motion. These control experiments are also highly recommended for other rotation speed settings and experimental conditions. Finally, we discuss strategies to minimize fluid motion in clinorotation experiments.

Choosing the optimal settings for force intensities in the initial phase of orthodontic tooth movement is the key to successful orthodontic treatment. It is known that orthodontic tooth movement is mainly mediated by tensile and compressive forces that are communicated to the alveolar bone via the periodontal ligament. While the revelation of the complex molecular network was already approached by transcriptomic analysis of compressed periodontal ligament cells, the entity of molecular key players activated by tensile forces remains elusive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of mechanical tensile forces on the gene expression profile of human primary periodontal ligament stromal cells, mimicking the initial phase of orthodontic tooth movement. A transcriptomic analysis of tension-treated and untreated periodontal ligament stromal cells yielded 543 upregulated and 793 downregulated differentially expressed genes. Finally, six highly significant genes were found in the transcriptome that are related to biological processes with relevance to orthodontic tooth movement, including apelin, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, noggin, sulfatase 1, secreted frizzled-related protein 4 and stanniocalcin 1. Additionally, differences of gene expression profiles between individual cell donors showed a high effect size. Closer understanding of the roles of the identified candidates in the initial phase of orthodontic tooth movement could help to clarify the underlying mechanisms, which will be essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies in orthodontics.

Abstract: Summary
Engineered systems for the direct air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide (CO2) are being investigated worldwide. Here, we demonstrate a technology for DAC that uses molecular sieves and, in some cases, H2O harvesting. A combination of a commercially available desiccant, AQSOA-Z02A, and a mordenite-type zeolite (MOR) enables continuous operation of a designed DAC system comprised of two parallel units with a regeneration temperature of 100°C. The system using pure zeolite alone requires regeneration at temperatures between 200°C and 300°C. Techno-economic analyses of 12 process scenarios reveal that the energy requirement of the best scenario investigated is 71 GJ/tCO2, while the conventional pure zeolite-based system requires 200 GJ/tCO2. The optimized system gives a cost between $246 and $568 per ton CO2 captured, depending on the energy costs. The price can be dramatically lowered or profitable when the system operates at sub-0°C temperatures or with integration of water harvesting, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Transition metal-catalyzed C–H functionalization has recently emerged as a powerful synthetic tool for accessing various value-added structural motifs. However, addressing the remote C–H activation including γ-C(sp3)–H and meta-C(sp2)–H versions is far less investigated and more challenging than that of ortho-C(sp2)–H activation. By fine-tuning the characteristics of the C–osmium (Os) σ bond in situ generated by the phenylpyridine scaffold-mediated ortho-C–H activation/C,N-bidentate coordination, either Os(II)-catalyzed intramolecular γ-C(sp3)–H amidation or intermolecular meta-C(sp2)–H alkylation has been realized in a highly efficient and chemo-/site-/region-selective manner. Through integrated experimental and computational mechanistic studies, the principle of the observed selectivity and two distinct reaction pathways, involving the Os(IV)-nitrenoid-mediated Os(II)-Os(IV)-Os(II) catalytic cycle and the Os(III)-radical-enabled Os(II)-Os(III)-Os(II) SET process, respectively, have been also clarified. Taken together, it provides an insightful reference benchmark for the future development of more wonderful C–H functionalizations mediated by transition metals, especially by less-explored Os.

Abstract: Summary
Minimizing the potential drop due to serial resistances in electrocatalytic systems and the corresponding energy overhead is required to achieve better overall catalytic performance. However, the role of the support is normally overlooked through iR compensation. Here, a silver nanowire (AgNW) aerogel-based support is developed to generate highly energy-efficient catalytic systems upon catalyst loading. In a case study of two Ni-based catalytic systems for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), outstanding performance is achieved with ultralow solution resistance (Rs ∼ 0.3 Ω) and overpotential without iR compensation (87 and 77 mV at 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, respectively). Density functional calculations support the theoretical hypothesis that the support-induced hierarchical nanostructures of the loaded catalyst could result in favorable hydrogen adsorption sites and enhanced conductivity and HER activity. This work thus opens up the possibility of developing highly efficient catalytic systems using NW-based supports.

Abstract: Introduction
The tumor lysis syndrome is a medical emergency. Its presentation can be spontaneous or secondary, as a consequence of the established treatment. The diagnosis and treatment of the tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has become a crucial goal to the evolution and improvement of treatments and targeted therapies.
Methods
Between January 2014 and December 2019, we retrospectively reviewed inpatients aged over 18 years with hematological neoplasms from a tertiary hospital in Brazil. We identified 112 episodes of TLS in 97 patients. The incidence was 10.5% and the median OS was 13.0 months (95%CI 6.2 - 19.7). The median age was 56 years (IQR 39.5 - 64). The most frequent diagnoses were multiple myeloma (18.6%), acute myeloid leukemia (17.5%) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (17.5%). All patients received intravenous (IV) hydration. The management also included the administration of allopurinol in 76% of the cases and rasburicase in eight patients. Renal replacement therapy was necessary in 37% of the cases. In the multivariate analysis, age, HIV status and ICU treatment were significantly associated with OS.
Conclusion
The TLS is a serious complication in the setting of hematological malignancies. The use of scores for risk stratification, as well as the inclusion of prophylactic measures and prompt treatment with frequent laboratory monitoring, is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality in the comprehensive treatment of these patients.

Abstract: Summary
Band inversion is a physical phenomenon that can warp the band structure in topological insulators, generating multiple electronic valleys for conducting carriers. However, the conditions under which band inversion induces warping are not well understood. Here, we derive two general rules that must be satisfied for band warping to occur in centrosymmetric and non-magnetic topological insulators: (1) bands must be sufficiently inverted, and (2) secondary bands must have opposite parity and be close in energy to the band edges. We chart the valley degeneracies that can emerge from band inversion in each of the 11 centrosymmetric point groups, revealing that an increase in the valley degeneracy between 2- and 48-fold is possible from band inversion. The generalized rules offer a unique band engineering approach by capitalizing on the non-trivial electronic structures of topological insulators.

Abstract: Summary
Niobium-based Wadsley-Roth materials are an emerging class of battery anode materials that enable ultra-fast charging rates beyond 20C. This new regime of above 5C poses challenges for existing battery parameterization and modeling due to larger concentration gradients, nonlinearities, and sensitivities to parameterization errors. This work develops a protocol to tackle these challenges, with less than 6% error margins up to 20C in coin cells, enabling a detailed study of the Wadsley-Roth material electrochemistry. Crucially, it unveils and adopts a rate dependency of the lithium intercalation diffusion coefficient. Additionally, the P2D modeling method is extended to P4D to predict the ultra-high rate performance of 3 Ah commercial-scale pouch cells based solely on lab-scale coin cell data. Overall, this provides researchers and engineers with a comprehensive guide for ultra-high rate cells to delineate the performance-limiting processes and to design batteries for the electrification of an extended regime of applications.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium dendrite growth hinders the use of lithium metal anodes in commercial batteries. We present a 3D model to study the mechanical and electrochemical mechanisms that drive microscale plating. With this model, we investigate electrochemical response across a lithium protrusion characteristic of rough anode surfaces, representing the separator as a porous polymer in non-conformal contact with a lithium anode. The impact of pressure on separator morphology and electrochemical response is of particular interest, as external pressure can improve cell performance. We explore the relationships between plating propensity, stack pressure, and material properties. External pressure suppresses lithium plating due to interfacial stress and separator pore closure, leading to inhomogeneous plating rates. For moderate pressures, dendrite growth is completely suppressed, as plating will occur in the electrolyte-filled gaps between anode and separator. In fast-charging conditions and systems with low electrolyte diffusivities, the benefits of pressure are overridden by ion transport limitations.

Abstract: Summary
Recycling spent lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) guarantees the conservation of important metal resources by reducing demands on raw supply and offsetting the energy and environmental costs associated with its manufacture. Employing a molten salt as a solvent for extraction affords a much greener and simpler route to metal recovery by electrochemical means. The current mechanistic understanding of the electrochemical recovery of metals in molten salts needs to be improved for the process to be optimized. X-ray computed tomography offers a non-destructive approach for 3D microstructure visualization and subsequent quantification. Here, we study the electrochemical deposition of recovered cobalt metal from lithium cobalt oxide, LiCoO2 in LiCl-KCl eutectic (LKE). This diagnostic approach has been applied to LiCoO2-LKE samples before and after electrolysis at 450°C, yielding key insights into the morphological evolution of product formation.

Abstract: Introduction
Chronic immune thrombocytopenia (cITP) is characterized by dysregulation of the immune response. Until recently, the role of Th2-related cytokine gene polymorphisms was unclear. Interleukin 4 (IL-4) exerts its functions by binding to three types of IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) complexes. We aimed to explore the potential association between the gene polymorphism of IL-4Rα and cITP.
Methods
We investigated the clinical impact of the IL-4Rα (rs1801275) A>G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method in 82 cITP patients and 60 healthy controls (HCs).
Results
The IL-4Rα (rs1801275) A>G polymorphism analysis showed the mutant GG genotype was significantly higher in control females (p = 0.033). The wild AA genotype had a higher bleeding score (p = 0.02) in the adulthood onset group. Furthermore, the wild AA genotype in the cITP childhood onset group was significantly associated with the disease severity, as well as the response to treatment (p = 0.040).
Conclusion
The mutant G allele is protective against the susceptibility to cITP in the Egyptian females. The IL-4Rα (rs1801275) A>G polymorphism may affect the clinical severity of cITP and treatment response in the Egyptian population.

Abstract: The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori induces a strong inflammatory response in gastric mucosa manifested by the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the places of infection, and by changes in epithelial integrity and function. At the molecular level, this innate immune response is essentially dependent on the activation of NF-κB transcription factors regulating the expression of chemotactic factors, e.g., IL-8. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the NF-κB signaling pathway is triggered by the bacterial heptose metabolites, which activate the host ALPK1-TIFA axis. TIFA has been suggested to promote oligomerization and activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, which further stimulates TAK1-IKK signaling. Here, we demonstrate that ALPK1-dependent TIFA activation in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells is followed in time by a decline in TIFA levels, and that this process is impeded by inhibitors of the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. According to our data, TRAF2, TRAF6, TAK1 or NEMO are not required for TIFA degradation. Additionally, H. pylori promotes the interaction of TIFA with free polyubiquitin as well as with optineurin, TAX1BP1 and LAMP1, which are known protein adaptors involved in intracellular trafficking to lysosomes.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies, with a 5-year survival rate of 5–10 %. The high mortality rate is due to the asymptomatic progression of clinical features in metastatic stages of the disease, which renders standard therapeutic options futile. PDAC is characterised by alterations in several genes that drive carcinogenesis and limit therapeutic response. The two most common genetic aberrations in PDAC are the mutational activation of KRAS and loss of the tumour suppressor CDK inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), which culminate the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), that promote G1 cell cycle progression. Therapeutic strategies focusing on the CDK4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib (PD-0332991) may potentially improve outcomes in this malignancy. MicroRNAs (miRs/miRNAs) are small endogenous non-coding RNA molecules associated with cellular proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, and cell cycle. Primarily, miR-21 promotes cell proliferation and a higher proportion of PDAC cells in the S phase, while knockdown of miR-21 has been linked to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and inhibition of cell proliferation. In this study, using a CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screen, we individually silenced the expression of miR-21 in two PDAC cell lines and in combination with PD-0332991 treatment, we examined the synergetic mechanisms of CDK4/6 inhibitors and miR-21 knockouts (KOs) on cell survival and death. This combination reduced cell proliferation, cell viability, increased apoptosis and G1 arrest in vitro. We further analysed the mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis of PDAC cells; then assessed the protein content of these cells and revealed numerous Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with PD-0332991 treatment and miR-21 knocking out. Our results demonstrate that combined targeting of CDK4/6 and silencing of miR-21 represents a novel therapeutic strategy in PDAC.

Abstract: Adipose tissue (AT) dysfunctions are associated with the onset of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Targeting glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide receptor (GIPR) is a valid option to increase the efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in T2DM treatment. Nevertheless, the therapeutic potential of targeting the GIP/GIPR axis and its effect on the AT are controversial. In this work, we explored the expression and regulation of GIPR in precursor cells and mature adipocytes, investigating if and how obesogenic stimuli and thiazolidinediones perturb GIPR expression. Using publicly available gene expression datasets, we assessed that, among white adipose tissue (WAT) cells, adipocytes express lower levels of GIPR compared to cells of mesothelial origin, pericytes, dendritic and NK/T cells. However, we report that GIPR levels markedly increase during the in vitro differentiation of both murine and human adipocytes, from 3T3-L1 and human mesenchymal precursor cells (MSCs), respectively. Notably, we demonstrated that thiazolidinediones – ie. synthetic PPARγ agonists widely used as anti-diabetic drugs and contained in the adipogenic mix – markedly induce GIPR expression. Moreover, using multiple in vitro systems, we assessed that thiazolidinediones induce GIPR in a PPARγ-independent manner. Our results support the hypothesis that PPARγ synthetic agonists may be used to increase GIPR levels in AT, potentially affecting in turn the targeting of GIP system in patients with metabolic dysfunctions. Furthermore, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that proinflammatory stimuli, and especially the TNFα, represses GIPR both in human and murine adipocytes, even though discordant results were obtained between human and murine cellular systems for other cytokines. Finally, we demonstrated that GIPR is negatively affected also by the excessive lipid engulfment. Overall, we report that obesogenic stimuli - ie. pro-inflammatory cytokines and the increased lipid accumulation – and PPARγ synthetic ligands oppositely modulate GIPR expression, possibly influencing the effectiveness of GIP agonists.

Abstract: Summary
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction offers an efficient way to curtail carbon emissions and generate value-added chemicals and fuels. However, this reaction still suffers from sluggish kinetics and poor selectivity, especially for the formation of multi-carbon products. Here, we report the preparation of copper nanosheet arrays mainly enclosed by {100} facets on copper foils. The copper nanosheets promote the formation of multi-carbon products with a multi-carbon to single-carbon ratio of 7.2, which is almost 18 times that of bare copper foils. Electrochemical investigations reveal that the density of adsorbed potassium ions on copper nanosheet surfaces is approximately five times that on pristine copper foils. Theoretical calculations indicate that the adsorbed potassium ions can effectively modulate the electronic structures of copper nanosheets and thus lower the energy barriers for highly selective generation of multi-carbon products. This work highlights the substantial implications of cation-catalyst interactions for multi-carbon production in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction.

Abstract: Summary
Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are amphiphilic, fluorogenic molecules that spontaneously associate with lipid bilayer membranes and are gaining attention as molecular reporters, particularly for exosome detection by flow cytometry. Questions nonetheless remain on how to best design COEs for optimal performance and on the geometry of lipid bilayer intercalation. In response, we designed a series of oligo-phenylenevinylene COEs with varying lengths and numbers of charged groups to address these uncertainties. Examination of the organization within lipid bilayers through polarized fluorescence microscopy shows that the optical transition moments are perpendicular to the bilayer plane, with the conjugated segment flanked by hydrophobic phospholipid tails. COEs initially form a disorganized layer on the vesicle periphery, reflecting electrostatic association before intercalation. Uptake experiments show that longer dimensions and increased numbers of charges allow for a higher degree of cellular association. Both shorter core length and increased number of charges accelerate the rate needed to achieve emission saturation.

Abstract: Summary
Superlubricity, a state with nearly zero friction, is highly desirable for many engineering applications, yet its implementation has so far been constrained due to limited contact size, strict environmental requirements, and poor lifetime. By designing superlattice films with alternating molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten carbide layers, we report that long-term macroscale superlubricity (friction coefficient of 0.006) can be achieved in mild vacuum (∼10−3 Pa) with robust environmental adaptability. Such extraordinary performance is enabled when the fine structure of the bilayer unit is rationally controlled to yield numerous incommensurate nanocontacts between highly ordered MoS2 and metal-oxide nanoparticles spontaneously formed during tribological sliding. Our analysis indicates that the ceramic phase with precisely controlled thickness is critical for superlubricity by helping to stiffen the film, facilitate the preferential growth of crystalline MoS2, and produce lubricous nanoparticles. The superlattice architecture offers a general route for designing MoS2-based materials toward long-lifetime, self-rejuvenating macroscale superlubricity.

Abstract: Summary
In lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries, catalytic conversion of lithium superoxide (LiO2) is a critical step to enhance kinetics. However, it is challenging for catalysts to be both highly efficient in the charging and discharging processes owing to the varying electrochemical environments. Here, we have achieved the desirable catalysis for the bidirectional electrode process by intelligently tuning the electronic structure of platinum/vanadium oxide (Pt/VOx). Due to changes in the internal electric field, the structure of Pt/VOx dynamically evolves during cycling (Pt/V2O3 or Pt/V2O5). The different redox states of the VOx can dynamically tune the electron density of Pt due to the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), resulting in desirable adsorption behavior for LiO2 in the bidirectional electrode process. Consequently, Li–O2 batteries with Pt/VOx electrodes show ultra-low charge overpotential (0.14 V) and higher capacity (13,270 mAh g−1), indicating the great potential of catalyst reconstruction for high-performance Li–O2 batteries.

Here, we focus on using mycelium to gain wood composites and integrating experiments and machine learning for better mechanical properties. We grow mycelium Pleurotus eryngii on stalk fibers as a natural adhesive by forming a secondary fibrous network. We find that mycelium enhances the composite mechanics but breaks down at high temperatures. We obtain composite samples with an ultimate strength of up to 12.99 MPa with a Young’s modulus of 3.66 GPa, which is higher than samples without mycelium obtained from the same condition. We build machine learning models based on experimental tests to predict the material functions for any treatment conditions. The composite with mycelium requires a relatively lower temperature, higher pressure, and shorter pressing time to yield higher strength and modulus. Our results could be useful for engineering composites from living materials.

Abstract: Summary
Achieving control in the design of monolayer 2D functional catalysts represents a significant challenge. If that challenge is surmounted, coordinated single-metal-atom sites can offer tailored electronic configuration, ligation geometries, chemical activity and selectivity, and stability. We report spectroscopic evidence of the formation of a 2D metal-organic framework supported by a single graphene sheet in which coordination among tetra-pyridyl porphyrins (TPyPs) is spontaneously obtained by exploiting single iron atoms. The spectroscopic characterization, together with ab initio methods, reveals that metal intermolecular coordination occurs via the terminal nitrogen atoms in the pyridinic residues of adjacent TPyPs. Interestingly, the peripheral coordination of metal atoms impacts the electronic configuration of the porphyrin’s core. Due to the chemical stability of the graphene layer, its weak interaction with the metal-organic framework, and the known electrochemical activity of the latter, this system represents an optimal candidate for the design and engineering of prototype 2D electrocatalytic materials.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing demand for heating and cooling in the building sector is a major contributor to global energy consumption and carbon emissions. Here we report the potential for heat recovery technologies and thermal energy storage in reducing the primary energy consumption and carbon footprint of all US buildings. Using thermodynamic models of appliances with significant thermal energy utilization, we estimate that there is a potential to recover ∼3,300 × 1015 J of waste heat across all buildings in the US. Effective utilization of this waste heat using simple retrofits and inexpensive storage media can save ∼19% of primary energy consumption in buildings. The matching of operating conditions for representative end uses and energy savings potential associated with the appropriate thermal energy recovery and storage system will help researchers identify and develop tailored low-cost materials in concert with desired storage temperature and energy and power densities.

Abstract: Summary
Functional coatings are used in a wide range of high surface-area technologies, such as low-E windows and photovoltaics. Solution-based coatings are typically less expensive to produce than vacuum-based coatings; however, it is generally more difficult to produce high-quality coatings using solution-based methods due to lower control over the physical and chemical processes involved. Here, we show how a self-driving laboratory can be used to optimize spray coating parameters. For this demonstration, we optimized the combustion synthesis of spray-cast conductive palladium (Pd) films. The closed-loop optimization yielded films with conductivities of >4 MS/m, which compares favorably with the conductivities of 2–6 MS/m reported for thin Pd films obtained by vacuum-based sputtering processes. The champion coating conditions were scaled up to an 8× larger area using the same spray-coating apparatus while preserving coating quality and conductivity. This work shows how self-driving laboratories can optimize solution-based coatings at scale.

Abstract: Summary
Bistable structures in nature are unparalleled for their fast response and force amplification even with the most minute physical stimulation. However, current works on bistable structures mainly focus on their stable states, while promising intermediate states with a large range of tunable energy barriers are missing. Here, we report a type of ultra-tunable bistable structure. Our results show that the trigger force of a single structure can be tuned to 0.1% of its maximum value, and the lifted weight difference exceeds 107 times using grippers composed of proposed structures with different design parameters. We prototyped various functional robots using the proposed structures to demonstrate their wide-range design space across materials and scales, such as an ultra-sensitive robotic flytrap, a fast catcher, a minimal jumper, etc. This work broadens the frontiers of bistable structure design and leads a way to future design in robotics, biomedical engineering, architecture, and kinetic art.

Abstract: Summary
Organic crystals demonstrating large thermal expansion effects are rarely reported. In particular, it is a challenge to effectively translate the expansion or contraction of crystal lattices to macroscopic crystal shape deformations, which are useful for the construction of high-precision microscale actuators and soft robotics. Here, we report a dynamic organic crystal based on a π-extended fluorenone derivative, 4-DTpFO, which, upon thermal stimulation, exhibits anisotropic lattice expansions along with a fully reversible crystal shape deformation. A molecular configuration change results in expansion with positive and negative thermal expansion coefficients of 410 × 10−6 K−1 and −403 × 10−6 K−1, respectively, in the temperature range of 350–440 K, before a second-order phase transition occurs. The applicability is demonstrated in a thermal microswitch. Such a significant but finely controllable thermomechanical change in an organic crystal promises advanced applications in diverse fields, including intelligent materials and ultrasensitive devices.

Vitamin D3 protects against respiratory syncytial virus-induced barrier dysfunction in airway epithelial cells via PKA signaling pathway,

Abstract: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children globally and is responsible for hospitalization and mortality in the elderly population. Virus-induced airway epithelial barrier damage is a critical step during RSV infection, and emerging studies suggest that RSV disrupts the tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs) between epithelial cells, increasing the permeability of the airway epithelial barrier. The lack of commercially available vaccines and effective antiviral drugs for RSV emphasizes the need for new management strategies. Vitamin D3 is a promising intervention for viral infection due to its critical role in modulating innate immune responses. However, there is limited evidence on the effect of vitamin D3 on RSV pathogenies. Here, we investigated the impact of vitamin D3 on RSV-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms. We found that pre-incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3, the active form of vitamin D3, alleviated RSV-induced epithelial barrier disruption in a dose-dependent manner without affecting viability in 16HBE cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 induced minor changes in the protein expression level of TJ/AJ proteins in RSV-infected cells. We observed increased CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 during 1,25(OH)2D3 exposure, indicating that vitamin D3 triggered protein kinase A (PKA) activity in 16HBE. PKA inhibitors modified the restoration of barrier function by 1,25(OH)2D3 in RSV-infected cells, implying that PKA signaling is responsible for the protective effects of vitamin D3 against RSV-induced barrier dysfunction in airway epithelial cells. Our findings suggest vitamin D3 as a prophylactic intervention to protect the respiratory epithelium during RSV infections.

Abstract: The ability of cancer cells to finally overcome various lines of treatment in due course has always baffled the scientific community. Even with the most promising therapies, relapse is ultimately seen, and this resilience has proved to be a major hurdle in the management of cancer. Accumulating evidence now attributes this resilience to plasticity. Plasticity is the ability of cells to change their properties and is substantial as it helps in normal tissue regeneration or post-injury repair processes. It also helps in the overall maintenance of homeostasis. Unfortunately, this critical ability of cells, when activated incorrectly, can lead to numerous diseases, including cancer. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the plasticity aspect with an emphasis on cancer stem cells (CSCs). We discuss the various forms of plasticity that provide survival advantages to CSCs. Moreover, we explore various factors that affect plasticity. Furthermore, we provide the therapeutic implications of plasticity. Finally, we provide an insight into the future targeted therapies involving plasticity for better clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Chemoselectivity in the hydrogenation of carbonyl over alkene bonds is valuable for producing industrial chemicals. In this study, we investigate the role of water in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde on cobalt and cobalt boride catalysts by combining rate measurements, in situ characterization, and computational calculations. Ex situ and in situ spectroscopic analyses indicate that the boron species do not significantly modify the intrinsic electronic properties of cobalt. However, during thermal treatments, they exsolve from the bulk phase and become enriched on the surface, forming acidic species that enhance the activity and selectivity of carbonyl bond hydrogenation by three and two times, respectively. A small amount of water is able to promote hydrogenation. When titania, ceria, and zirconia are used as supports, metal-support interactions result in smaller particles that show a drop in selectivity toward the desirable unsaturated alcohol. Overall, the combination of the presence of boron species and strong metal-support interactions protects the catalysts from water attack, resulting in enhanced stability.

Abstract: Summary
Seasonal influenza A viruses continue to pose a public health threat, and current vaccines are not sufficiently effective because of virus mutation. There is an urgent need to develop a broad-protection influenza A vaccine. Our team previously designed potential universal hemagglutinin (HA) sequences against seasonal influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 (mH1 and mH3, respectively) through a mosaic strategy. In this study, we construct DNA vaccines by linking the antigens mH1 and mH3 via internal ribosome entry sites and then wrap the DNA with the deoxycholic acid-modified polyetherimide to form DNA nanovaccines. A microneedle is used to deliver DNA nanovaccines, and the data show that better cellular and cross-reactivity and protective immunity are induced compared with the intramuscular injection method. These results suggest that microneedle-based delivery of DNA nanovaccines could be a promising platform for development of a broad-protection influenza vaccine.

Abstract: Summary
Reversible CO2 capture and release under ambient conditions is crucial for energy-efficient carbon capture and storage. Here, we report the pressure swing crystallization of CO2 in a single-crystalline guanidinium sulfate-based clathrate salt under practical conditions of 52 kPa and 298 K, with a high CO2 density (0.252 g cm−3) and capacity (17 wt %). The captured CO2 is released as a pure stream through moderate means of pressure or temperature stimulation, all while the desorbed Gua2SO4 is ready for another cycle. The clathrate is selective exclusively to CO2 even in the presence of common flue gas components, such as water vapor and N2, owing to the specific electrostatic interaction between the CO2 and guanidinium cations. The mechanism unraveled through single-crystal studies is distinctively different from physisorption or chemisorption, opening up a promising venue for future carbon capture and storage technologies through rapid CO2 solidification using an abundant salt.

Abstract: Introduction
The diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and, despite all the progress in this field, central nervous system infiltration (CNSi) still occurs at an incidence of 2–10%. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the Central Nervous System International Prognostic Index (CNS-IPI) score in daily practice regarding the reproducibility in a heterogeneous cohort apart from a clinical trial.
Methods
Primary DLBCL patients were eligible for this study, between January 2007 and January 2017. All patients were treated with rituximab-based chemotherapy, mostly R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone). The CNSi was diagnosed by liquor (positive cytology and/or immunophenotype), computerized tomography, magnetic resonance image and/or fluorodeoxy-glucose-positron emission tomography, requested only in symptomatic patients when the CNSi was clinically suspected. The CNS-IPI was assessed by graphical comparison and calibration.
Results
After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 322 patients were available for the analysis. The median follow-up was 60 months and the median age was 58 years. Seven patients experienced CNSi, characterizing an incidence of 2.17% (7/322). Comparing groups of patients with and without CNSi, we observed that the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), number of extranodal sites, IPI, kidney/adrenal and absence of complete response were statistically different. The CNS-IPI model stratified patients in a three-risk group model as low-, intermediate- and high-risk. In our cohort, using the same stratification, we obtained an equivalent the 2-year rate of CNS relapse of 0.0%, 0.8% and 13.8%, respectively.
Conclusion
Our study reinforces the reproducibility of the CNS-IPI, specifically apart from clinical trials, and suggests the CNS-IPI score as a tool to guide therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Polymer coatings and high mechanical pressure are promising solutions for improving interfacial contact in all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. However, design guidelines for polymer type, thickness, and stack pressure are still missing. In this study, we present a model for mechanics at the interface of polymer-coated solid-state electrolytes in contact with a lithium metal anode, considering lithium creep, polymer viscoelasticity, and pressure-driven electrochemistry. We cover various common polymer coatings, eventually highlighting the dependence of interfacial resistance on stack pressure and coating thickness. A machine learning algorithm with high-throughput calculations is used to optimize the combination of pressure and coating thicknesses. Numerical results are in good agreement with existing experimental evidence. A transition map is derived, which may serve as design guideline in predicting the values of current density, stack pressure, and polymeric thickness able to ensure a steady performance over time.

Abstract: Summary
As electronic information technology is developing rapidly, the advancement of high-efficiency electromagnetic absorbing materials has attracted extensive attention. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a Bi2S3/Ti3C2Tx composite using a solvothermal method. By introducing Bi2S3 to regulate the composite’s dielectric parameters and polarization interface, an outstanding absorbing performance was obtained. According to the testing results, the optimal reflection loss of the Bi2S3/Ti3C2Tx composite was −50.66 dB with a thickness of 1.11 mm, and the maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) was 3.89 GHz at 1.2 mm. The synergic effect of the Ti3C2Tx multilayer structure and Bi2S3 interface polarization is conducive to the multiple resonator reflections of the incident electromagnetic wave and the effective loss of electromagnetic wave at the polarization interface, which can significantly improve the electromagnetic wave absorption performance. The current study paves a way for preparing ultra-thin metal sulfide materials with high electromagnetic wave absorption.

Abstract: Summary
Continuous UiO-66 films are promising for ion sieving because of their sub-nanometer-sized apertures and high chemical stability, but their preparation is challenging. Here, we report a direct cathodic deposition of UiO-66 films, which is fast, convenient, and controllable. Electrochemical measurements suggest that lithium nitrate accelerates deprotonation of carboxylic linkers and yields UiO-66 films within 1 h. Material characterizations reveal that the crystallinity of the deposited UiO-66 films improves with deposition temperature and that the morphology is controlled by the molar ratio of the ditopic linker to the monotopic modulator. Crystalline and continuous UiO-66 films are obtained with a linker-to-modulator ratio of 1:120 at 120°C. The anodic aluminum oxide membrane-supported continuous UiO-66 films display excellent selective ion transport performance with a lithium/magnesium selectivity of 286 and a lithium permeance of 11.2 mol m−2 h−1, placing them among the best metal-organic framework (MOF) membranes reported in literature.

Abstract: Summary
The large energy barrier for lithium-ion transport across polymer-ceramic interface limits the significant improvement of the ionic conductivity of composite solid-state electrolytes (CSEs). Herein, we construct high-efficiency cross-phase ion transport channels (CITCs) between poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) by cross-linking reaction of 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) with dehydrofluorinated PVDF and LLZTO. The CITCs enhance the lithium-ion concentration at the PVDF-LLZTO interface and provide continuous low-barrier lithium-ion pathways to achieve a quite high ionic conductivity (8.7 × 10−4 S cm−1) of CSE (PML). Furthermore, we quantitatively reveal that the CITCs increase the proportion of interfacial lithium-ion transport in CSEs from 4.2% to 26.2%, which further promotes the lithium-ion transport contribution of LLZTO from 8.6% to 18.2%. LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2|PML|Li solid-state batteries can stably operate for 1,700 cycles at 2C and 25°C, and pouch cells also exhibit excellent cycling and safety performance. This work reveals that cross-phase lithium-ion transport in CSEs determines their ionic conductivity.

Abstract: Mutations in CSA and CSB proteins cause Cockayne syndrome, a rare genetic neurodevelopment disorder. Alongside their demonstrated roles in DNA repair and transcription, these two proteins have recently been discovered to regulate cytokinesis, the final stage of the cell division. This last finding allowed, for the first time, to highlight an extranuclear localization of CS proteins, beyond the one already known at mitochondria. In this study, we demonstrated an additional role for CSA protein being recruited at centrosomes in a strictly determined step of mitosis, which ranges from pro-metaphase until metaphase exit. Centrosomal CSA exerts its function in specifically targeting the pool of centrosomal Cyclin B1 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, a lack of CSA recruitment at centrosomes does not affect Cyclin B1 centrosomal localization but, instead, it causes its lasting centrosomal permanence, thus inducing Caspase 3 activation and apoptosis. The discovery of this unveiled before CSA recruitment at centrosomes opens a new and promising scenario for the understanding of some of the complex and different clinical aspects of Cockayne Syndrome.

Abstract: Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) has been reported to regulate transcription factor activity and cancer development, but how it affects the function of Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1), a crucial transcription factor and key oncogene participating in tumorigenesis, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the regulatory role of Ca2+ on FOXM1 and found that Ca2+ depletion caused the distribution of FOXM1 to aggregate on the nuclear envelope, which was also observed in many cell lines. Further experiments revealed that sequestrated FOXM1 colocalized with lamin B in the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and was affected by the activity of nuclear export protein exportin 1 (XPO1). To investigate how intracellular Ca2+ affects FOXM1, we found that among the posttranscriptional modifications, only SUMOylation of FOXM1 showed a pronounced increase under reduced Ca2+, and suppressed SUMOylation rescued FOXM1 sequestration. In addition, Ca2+-dependent SUMOylated FOXM1 appeared to enhance the G2/M transition of the cell cycle and decrease cell apoptosis. In conclusion, our findings provide a molecular basis for the relationship between Ca2+ signaling and FOXM1 regulation, and we look to elucidate Ca2+-dependent FOXM1 SUMOylation-related biological functions in the future.

Abstract: Many signaling processes rely on information decoding at the plasma membrane, and membrane-associated proteins and their complexes are fundamental for regulating this process. Still many questions exist as to how protein complexes are assembled and function at membrane sites to change identity and dynamics of membrane systems. Peripheral membrane proteins containing a calcium and phospholipid-binding C2-domain can act in membrane-related signaling by providing a tethering function so that protein complexes form. C2 domain proteins termed C2-DOMAIN ABSCISIC ACID-RELATED (CAR) proteins are plant-specific, and the functional relevance of this C2 domain protein subgroup is just emerging. The ten Arabidopsis CAR proteins CAR1 to CAR10 have a single C2 domain with a plant-specific insertion, the so-called “CAR-extra-signature” or also termed “sig domain”. Via this “sig domain” CAR proteins can bind signaling protein complexes of different kinds and act in biotic and abiotic stress, blue light and iron nutrition. Interestingly, CAR proteins can oligomerize in membrane microdomains, and their presence in the nucleus can be linked with nuclear protein regulation. This shows that CAR proteins may play unprecedented roles in coordinating environmental responses and assembling required protein complexes to transmit information cues between plasma membrane and nucleus. The aim of this review is to summarize structure-function characteristics of the CAR protein family and assemble findings from CAR protein interactions and physiological functions. From this comparative investigation we extract common principles about the molecular operations that CAR proteins may fulfill in the cell. We also deduce functional properties of the CAR protein family based on its evolution and gene expression profiles. We highlight open questions and suggest novel avenues to prove and understand the functional networks and roles played by this protein family in plants.

Abstract: Hematopoiesis and lineage commitment are regulated by several conserved cell-intrinsic signaling pathways, including MAPKs and β-catenin/TCF/LEF. The Inhibitor of MyoD Family A (I-MFA), a transcriptional repressor and tumor suppressor gene, interacts with these pathways and is dysregulated in chronic and acute myeloid leukemias, suggesting it may play a role in development and differentiation during hematopoiesis. To study this, immune cell populations in the bone marrow (BM) and periphery were analyzed in mice lacking Mdfi, encoding I-MFA (I-MFA−/−), and wild type (WT) controls. I-MFA−/− mice had reduced spleen and BM cellularity, with significant hyposplenism, compared to WT mice. In blood, total red blood cells and platelet counts were significantly reduced in I-MFA−/− mice, accompanied by a reduction in megakaryocyte (MK)/erythrocyte progenitor cells and an increase in myeloid progenitors in BM compared to WT mice. The K562 cell line exhibits PMA-induced MK differentiation, and shRNA knockdown of I-MFA resulted in reduced differentiation compared to control, with an increase and prolongation in phospho-JNK and phospho-ERK signaling. Overexpression of I-MFA promoted MK differentiation. These results suggest I-MFA plays a cell-intrinsic role in the response to differentiation signals, an effect that can be explored in the context of hematological cancers or other blood proliferative disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The lack of long-term stability and reproducibility of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is the main roadblock preventing their successful commercialization. 3D/2D PSCs are one of the most prominent ways to address these issues. Various salts that are mostly based on phenyl ethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI) have been utilized to grow a 2D perovskite layer on 3D perovskites. Herein, we report the effect of substituting the methoxy (-OMe) group at the ortho (o), meta (m), and para (p) positions on PEAI salts. Photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence show that o-OMe-PEAI-treated surfaces achieve reduced defect densities and nonradiative recombination rates compared with the other analogs. Devices with PCEs over 23% are achieved for o-OMe-PEAI-based 3D/2D PSCs, and the enhanced performance is attributed to the favorable formation energy and desired vertical orientation according to the density functional theory (DFT) analyses. Finally, the unique orientation of the o-OMe-PEAI-based 2D perovskite results in significantly enhanced long-term, moisture, and thermal stability.

Abstract: Summary
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a number of healthcare-associated infections. Assessing single-cell contributions of P. aeruginosa to antibiotic resistance or virulence is a current challenge, because mechanistic behavior is conventionally inferred from ensemble cultures, thus averaging effects over a population. Here, we develop and characterize a device that can capture arrays of single P. aeruginosa cells in individual micropores to study their spectroelectrochemical behavior. An array of individual micropores is fabricated with dimensions designed to capture single P. aeruginosa cells in a vertical orientation. Upon application of an electrochemical potential waveform to the bottom Au layer, three characteristic fluorescence behaviors are observed from trapped cells that are sensitive to external conditions. The device developed here enables the study of parallel collections of single bacterial cells and will facilitate efforts to elucidate methods of bacterial communication and multidrug resistance at the single-cell level.

Abstract: Summary
2D transition metal dichalcogenides coupled to semiconductor quantum dots or metallic nanoparticles give rise to novel energy transfer pathways and intricate nonlinear optical properties. In this article, by using multiphoton microscopy, we observe photoluminescence signals in the green or blue light spectrum (higher than 2 eV) emitting from the gold nanoparticles that are coupled to tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayers, even when the excitation energy is as low as 1 eV. The pump power dependence indicates that these photoluminescence signals involve the absorption of three photons not by the gold nanoparticles or WS2 alone but through a one-photon intraband excitation in the gold nanoparticle and a two-photon excitation in WS2 that, via the excitonic resonance energy transfer, delivers the energy to the gold nanoparticle by inducing an interband excitation. We suggest ways to improve the light emission efficiency of this hybrid structure for a potential room temperature upconversion emitter.

Abstract: Summary
The origin of life must have involved an unlikely transition from chaotic chemistry to self-reproducing supramolecular structures. Previous quantitative analyses of self-reproducing mutually catalytic networks made of simple molecules have led to increasing popularity of this pre-RNA scenario for life’s origin. Here, we investigate in detail the reproduction characteristic of the graded autocatalysis replication domain (GARD) computer-simulated physicochemically rigorous lipid-based model. This model displays compatibility with heterogeneous environments, addresses the network’s spatial demarcation, and portrays trans-generational compositional information transfer. However, we find that compositionally reproducing states are extremely rare, suggesting that random roaming would be a vastly inefficient path toward reproduction. Rewardingly, the present study shows that all self-reproducing states are also dynamic attractors of the catalytic network. This suggests a greatly enhanced propensity for the spontaneous emergence of reproduction and primal evolution, augmenting the likelihood of protolife appearance.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium nitrate (LiNO3) is widely used to build a stable and highly Li+ conductive solid electrode/electrolyte interface (SEI) for ether-based electrolytes. However, the low solubility of LiNO3 in carbonate-based electrolytes limits its applications in high-voltage lithium-metal batteries. Herein, we report a strategy to introduce NO3− into carbonate electrolytes by a single ionic liquid-type additive, 1-decyl-1-methylpyrrolidine (Py110+) nitrate (IL–NO3–), without additional solubilizers to manipulate Li+ solvation structure. Compared with LiNO3, the weak binding energy between Py110+ and NO3− in IL–NO3– enables carbonate solvent molecules to easily break the IL–NO3– cluster. The NO3− participating in the Li+ solvation sheath can form a robust and highly conductive SEI to promote Li+ transport kinetics. This work provides a realistic reference for the application of an ionic liquid additive to build a stable SEI for advancing the development of lithium-metal batteries.

Abstract: Summary
The polarization of redox flow batteries (RFBs) consists of activation polarization, ohmic polarization, and concentration polarization. However, the three types of polarizations are coupled in practice, making it difficult to quantify the respective attributions to the total voltage loss and to compare the reported performance of RFBs under different working conditions. Here, we propose a method to operando decouple the polarizations of RFBs based on the different response times of the three kinds of polarizations. The decoupled polarizations in RFBs under different working conditions are presented with specific voltage losses, which clarifies the limit parameters of battery performance and makes the reports of RFBs comparable even with similar battery performances. This work opens up a method to quantitatively analyze activation polarization and concentration polarization separately in RFBs, which provides significant guidance for improving battery performance effectively.

Abstract: Summary
Unproductive side reactions, such as dendritic growth, are greatly restricting the deployment of aqueous zinc-ion batteries. Herein, a lanthanum oxide-tin double coating modified zinc anode (La2O3-Sn@Zn) is designed and prepared to solve these problems. Importantly, the tin layer grown in situ on the surface of bare zinc endows better zincophilic qualities given its lower energy barrier for nucleation and alloy formation. A lanthanum oxide layer ensures the contact isolation of zinc from electrolyte and the uniform distribution of zinc ions. With synergetic effects from both coatings, the La2O3-Sn@Zn anode ensures a stable, dendrite-free, side reaction-free zinc plating/stripping with a 60-fold prolonged service lifespan compared with bare zinc, even at a high current density of 5 mA cm−2. This work paves the way for a potential method to develop long-lifespan zinc anodes and zinc-ion batteries.

Abstract: Decreased male fertility is a growing health problem that requires a better understanding of molecular events regulating reproductive competence. Here the effects of circadian desynchrony on the rat spermatozoa functionality were studied. Circadian desynchrony was induced in rats that lived for 2 months under disturbed light conditions designed to mimic shiftwork in humans (two days of constant light, two days of continual dark, and three days of 14:10 h light:dark schedule). Such a condition abolished circadian oscillations in the rats' voluntary activity, followed by a flattened transcriptional pattern of the pituitary gene encoding follicle stimulating hormone subunit (Fshb), and genes important for germ cell maturation (Tnp1 and Prm2) as well as the clock in seminiferous tubules. However, the number of spermatozoa isolated from the epididymis of the rats suffering from circadian desynchrony did not deviate from the controls. Nevertheless, spermatozoa functionality, estimated by motility and progesterone-induced acrosome reaction, was reduced compared to the control. These changes were associated with the altered level of main markers of mitochondrial biogenesis (Pprgc1a/PGC1A, Nrf1/NRF1, Tfam, Cytc), decreased mitochondrial DNA copy number, ATP content, and clock genes (Bmal1/BMAL1, Clock, Cry1/2, and Reverba). The principal-component-analysis (PCA) points to a positive association of the clock and mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes in spermatozoa from rats suffering circadian desynchrony. Altogether, the results show the harmful effect of circadian desynchrony on spermatozoa functionality, targeting energetic homeostasis.

Abstract: Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by congenital anomalies, cancer predisposition and a severe hypo-proliferative anemia. It was the first disease linked to ribosomal dysfunction and >70 % of patients have been identified to have a haploinsufficiency of a ribosomal protein (RP) gene, with RPS19 being the most common mutation. There is significant variability within the disease in terms of phenotype as well as response to therapy suggesting that other genes contribute to the pathophysiology and potential management of this disease. To explore these questions, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen in a cellular model of DBA and identified Calbindin 1 (CALB1), a member of the calcium-binding superfamily, as a potential modifier of the disordered erythropoiesis in DBA. We used human derived CD34+ cells cultured in erythroid stimulating media with knockdown of RPS19 as a model for DBA to study the effects of CALB1. We found that knockdown of CALB1 in this DBA model promoted erythroid maturation. We also noted effects of CALB1 knockdown on cell cycle. Taken together, our results reveal CALB1 is a novel regulator of human erythropoiesis and has implications for using CALB1 as a novel therapeutic target in DBA.

Abstract: Summary
Self-assembled lamellar nanocolloids of two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets can provide new possibilities for tunable photonic crystalline devices based on their vivid structural color and reconfigurability. However, this remains a challenge because of the veiled dynamic behavior of 2D nanocolloids under electric fields and the lack of feasible manipulation methods. Here, we demonstrate a full-color tunable polyoxyalkyleneamine-tethered α-TiP nanocolloid possessing the ability to tune hue and brightness by harnessing field-induced phase transition phenomena, in which the intrinsic lamellar phase can transition to an optically anti-nematic phase via an isotropic phase at high-frequency fields and vice versa at low-frequency fields. This unique switching behavior is attributed to the formation of a dynamic polydomain structure characterized by stable intradomain lamellar ordering and reconfigurable interdomain ordering. This causes a clear discrepancy between optical observations and X-ray scattering measurements. By exploiting these, a switchable and multistable photonic crystalline device is successfully demonstrated.

Abstract: Summary
To reduce energy consumption and improve energy utilization in space conditioning, advanced heat pumping technologies are needed. The chemical looping heat pump (CLHP) is a promising thermodynamic cycle that has theoretically shown the potential to achieve a cooling coefficient of performance (COPc) increase of over 20% relative to conventional vapor compression systems. In this paper, the key process of the CLHP is experimentally demonstrated, and the system performance and non-ideal behavior are predicted using the component-level models. The results show the feasibility of electrochemical phase change of a working fluid; the peak COPc was 7.64 with a cooling capacity of 3.6 mW (cooling density of 2.57 W m−2) at both sink and source temperature of 23°C based on laboratory experiments. The COPc can theoretically reach up to 13 at a temperature lift of 15°C as long as an electrochemical cell can achieve a greater degree of conversion.

Abstract: Introduction
Epidemiologic studies on pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) have been conducted to evaluate the possible risk factors including genetic, infectious and environmental factors with the objective of idenfying the etiology. Mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2) plays an important role in first-line immune defense. HLA DRB1 alleles play a role in presentation of peptides to T cells and in activation of the adaptive immune response.
Objective
In our study, we aimed to investigate both the MBL2 gene variant and HLA-DRB1 alleles in pediatric ALL patients.
Materials
In this study, 86 high-risk ALL patients and 100 controls were included. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and PCR-sequence specific primer (SSP) methods were used for detection of polymorphism of the MBL2 and HLA-DRB1 alleles, respectively.
Results
The frequency of the MBL2 AB genotype was lower in female ALL patients, compared to male ALL patients (p = 0.034). An association was found between the MBL2 BB genotype and DRB1*07 and among patients with the MBL2 BB genotype; those who also carried the DRB1*07 and *04 alleles were significantly higher than those without the DRB1*07 and *04 alleles. (p = 0.048, p = 0.022, respectively).
Conclusion
This is the first study suggesting that the MBL2 BB genotype in association with the DRB1*07 or co-inheritance of the HLA-DRB1*04 and HLA DRB1*07 may have an impact on the etiopathogenesis of the disease.

Abstract: Summary
Viral variants of concern continue to arise for SARS-CoV-2, potentially impacting both methods for detection and mechanisms of action. Here, we investigate the effect of an evolving spike positive charge in SARS-CoV-2 variants and subsequent interactions with heparan sulfate and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the glycocalyx. We show that the positively charged Omicron variant evolved enhanced binding rates to the negatively charged glycocalyx. Moreover, we discover that while the Omicron spike-ACE2 affinity is comparable to that of the Delta variant, the Omicron spike interactions with heparan sulfate are significantly enhanced, giving rise to a ternary complex of spike-heparan sulfate-ACE2 with a large proportion of double-bound and triple-bound ACE2. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 variants evolve to be more dependent on heparan sulfate in viral attachment and infection. This discovery enables us to engineer a second-generation lateral-flow test strip that harnesses both heparin and ACE2 to reliably detect all variants of concern, including Omicron.

Abstract: Summary
2,2,7,7-tetrakis(N,N-dip-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is a popular hole-transporting material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), However, it suffers from high-cost and stability issues, which need to be overcome for PSC commercialization. Here, we report isomers of bithiophene-based HTMs functionalized with triarylamine and imidazole for PSCs. The planar 3-ImBT-2D (1) exhibits higher hole mobility than 5-ImBT-2D (2) via modulation of donor-group positions. The PSCs using HTM (1) deliver an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.73% with Li-TFSI doping and 17.79% without dopants. In addition, the Li-TFSI-free device based on 3-ImBT-2D yields a PCE of 21% after HTM surface modification with organic p-dopant dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (DPB). A molecular dynamics study shows that the isomer 3-ImBT-2D (1) folds up after deposition on perovskite films. As a result, the Li-TFSI-free devices exhibit higher stability, retaining 95.9% of the initial PCE after 800 h aging.

Abstract: Summary
Lead tellurides have been recognized as state-of-the-art thermoelectric generators (TEGs) for over 60 years. Recent efforts aim to lift the performance of n-type lead telluride (PbTe). Instead of doping elemental electron donors, we add the liquid-like Cu2S into a fully dense PbTe crystal, enabling a mixture of ionic and electronic conductors. The homogeneously distributed Cu2S nanoparticles act as active electron donors, dynamically pinning the solubility of Cu to an optimal value. Adding Cu2S also elicits hierarchical defects, constituting nanosized precipitates, nanoparticles, and intercalated Cu layers. Our n-type Cu2S-PbTe attains a high peak zT of 1.3 at 673 K with an average zTave of 0.98 within 300–673 K. Most importantly, it has a maximum conversion efficiency η of 4%, which, to the best of our knowledge, breaks the current record for an n-type PbTe-base single-leg device under a temperature difference ΔT of 300 K.

Abstract: Summary
Artificial channels that mimic biological systems are of significant interest, but their fabrication remains challenging. Here, we prepare the well-defined platinum(II)-based supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) 1 via the directional bonding of SCCs. These are attached to the inner walls of a solid polyethylene terephthalate channel having a bullet-like morphology based on self-assembled interfacial growth. The resulting channels allow the rapid transport of monovalent metal ions (K+, Na+, and Li+) from tip to base while inhibiting the migration of divalent ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+). These channels efficiently separate monovalent from divalent metal ions on this basis, with an ultrahigh K+/Mg2+ selectivity ratio of 1,015.5. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that this selectivity results from the high dehydration energy of the divalent ions and their strong interactions with porphyrin groups on the SCCs. The present work is expected to assist in the future design of functionalized ion channels and efficient separation membrane materials.

Abstract: Summary
Epoxide ring-opening reactions have long been utilized to furnish alcohol products that are valuable in many subfields of chemistry. While many epoxide-opening reactions are known, the hydrogenative opening of epoxides via ionic means remains challenging because of harsh conditions and reactive hydride nucleophiles. Recent progress has shown that radical chemistry can achieve hydrogenative epoxide ring opening under relatively mild conditions; however, these methods invariably require oxophilic metal catalysts and sensitive reagents. In response to these challenges, we report a new approach to epoxide ring-opening hydrogenation using bio-inspired Earth-abundant vitamin B12 and thiol-centric hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) co-catalysis to produce Markovnikov alcohols under visible light irradiation. This powerful reaction system exhibits a broad substrate scope, including a number of electrophilic and reductively labile functionalities that would otherwise be susceptible to reduction or cleavage by hydride nucleophiles, and preliminary mechanistic experiments are consistent with a radical process.

Abstract: Summary
High-energy-density fuels from carbon dioxide reduction are an ideal medium to store intermittent renewables. Lewis pairs are highly active for activation of small molecules. A challenge is to create electrochemically stable Lewis pairs on electrodes to exploit for small-molecule activation. Here, a strategy of protonating a surface oxidation layer of oxytropic alloys is proposed to create stable Lewis pairs by coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (Lewis acids) and metal hydroxyls (Lewis bases). We find that the element electronegativity and metal-hydroxyl stability are useful descriptors to screen available elements. The big electronegativity difference favors the element alloying, and the metal-hydroxyl stability indicates the possibility of formation of Lewis pairs. Lewis pairs tend to first capture and stabilize protons and then selectively activate carbon dioxide to various products, depending on the constituent of Lewis pairs. Our results verify that creating stable Lewis pairs is a promising material design concept for selective electrochemical reduction.

Abstract: Uncontrolled cell proliferation leads to several pathologies, including cancer. Thus, this process must be tightly regulated. The cell cycle accounts for cell proliferation, and its progression is coordinated with changes in cell shape, for which cytoskeleton reorganization is responsible. Rearrangement of the cytoskeleton allows for its participation in the precise division of genetic material and cytokinesis. One of the main cytoskeletal components is filamentous actin-based structures. Mammalian cells have at least six actin paralogs, four of which are muscle-specific, while two, named β- and γ-actin, are abundantly present in all types of cells. This review summarizes the findings that establish the role of non-muscle actin paralogs in regulating cell cycle progression and proliferation. We discuss studies showing that the level of a given non-muscle actin paralog in a cell influences the cell’s ability to progress through the cell cycle and, thus, proliferation. Moreover, we elaborate on the non-muscle actins’ role in regulating gene transcription, interactions of actin paralogs with proteins involved in controlling cell proliferation, and the contribution of non-muscle actins to different structures in a dividing cell. The data cited in this review show that non-muscle actins regulate the cell cycle and proliferation through varying mechanisms. We point to the need for further studies addressing these mechanisms.

Lipocalin-2 regulates the expression of interferon-stimulated genes and the susceptibility of prostate cancer cells to oncolytic virus infection,

Abstract: Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) performs pleiotropic and tumor context-dependent functions in cancers of diverse etiologies. In prostate cancer (PCa) cells, LCN2 regulates distinct phenotypic features, including cytoskeleton organization and expression of inflammation mediators. Oncolytic virotherapy uses oncolytic viruses (OVs) to kill cancer cells and induce anti-tumor immunity. A main source of specificity of OVs towards tumor cells stems from cancer-induced defects in interferon (IFN)-based cell autonomous immune responses. However, the molecular underpinnings of such defects in PCa cells are only partially understood. Moreover, LCN2 effects on IFN responses of PCa cells and their susceptibility to OVs are unknown. To examine these issues, we queried gene expression databases for genes coexpressed with LCN2, revealing co-expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and LCN2. Analysis of human PCa cells revealed correlated expression of LCN2 and subsets of IFNs and ISGs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated stable knockout of LCN2 in PC3 cells or transient overexpression of LCN2 in LNCaP cells revealed LCN2-mediated regulation of IFNE (and IFNL1) expression, activation of JAK/STAT pathway, and expression of selected ISGs. Accordingly, and dependent on a functional JAK/STAT pathway, LCN2 reduced the susceptibility of PCa cells to infection with the IFN-sensitive OV, EHDV-TAU. In PC3 cells, LCN2 knockout increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α). Inhibition of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) in PC3-LCN2-KO cells reduced p-eIF2α while increasing constitutive IFNE expression, phosphorylation of STAT1, and ISG expression; and decreasing EHDV-TAU infection. Together, these data propose that LCN2 regulates PCa susceptibility to OVs through attenuation of PERK activity and increased IFN and ISG expression.

Abstract: Summary
Ammonia production is a critical industrial process, and mild routes to recycle nitrates in wastewater could be a promising route to ammonia synthesis. In this study, ammonia production is demonstrated in a microbial electrosynthesis system with nitrate and an electrode as electron acceptors and donors, respectively. Based on the bidirectional extracellular electron transfer capability of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, our microbial electrosynthetic system achieves a maximum ammonia production rate of 24.3 μg h−1·mg protein−1 with 82.5% selectivity and 33.1% cathodic efficiency and functions for several cycles over 30 days. Electrochemical analysis suggests that cytochromes c, flavins, and the flavin/c-cytochrome combination play a pivotal role. Charge transfer resistance weakens over the course of weeks, resulting in easier electron transfer. Parallel reaction monitoring proteomics suggest that reversing a typical “Mtr pathway” plays a role, and a dissimilatory nitrate to ammonia pathway is used. This work proposes a progressive route to carry out ammonia synthesis under mild conditions.

Abstract: Cell size has profound effects on biological function, influencing a wide range of processes, including biosynthetic capacity, metabolism, and nutrient uptake. As a result, size is typically maintained within a narrow, population-specific range through size control mechanisms, which are an active area of study. While the physiological consequences of cell size are relatively well-characterized, less is known about its developmental consequences, and specifically its effects on developmental transitions. In this review, we compare systems where cell size is linked to developmental transitions, paying particular attention to examples from plants. We conclude by proposing that size can offer a simple readout of complex inputs, enabling flexible decisions during plant development.

Abstract: Summary
Endosomal escape remains a well-known bottleneck for successful small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics. Here, a chemical electron transfer (CET)-based self-activatable lipopolyplex is explored for producing singlet oxygen (1O2) in endosomes, thereby enhancing siRNA delivery. The lipopolyplex simultaneously encapsulates bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl) oxalate (TCPO), gold nanoparticles (GNs), and siRNA. GNs are specifically self-activated by the transferred chemical energy between TCPO and hydrogen peroxide, which is enhanced in the tumor microenvironment. Enhanced endosomal membrane damage is verified using a cytosolic fluorescent galectin-8 (Gal8)-mRuby reporter; the oxidation of 1O2 facilitates the rupture of endosomes within 4 h, improving the recruitment of Gal8 to disrupted endosomes up to ∼50-fold. This research demonstrates that CET can facilitate the transfer of nucleic acids from endosomes to the cytosol and provides a starting point for further cytosolic delivery applications.

Abstract: Allergic reactions are highly prevalent pathologies initiated by the production of IgE antibodies against harmless antigens (allergens) and the activation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) expressed in the surface of basophils and mast cells (MCs). Research on the mechanisms of negative control of those exacerbated inflammatory reactions has been intense in recent years. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) show important regulatory effects on MC-mediated immune responses, mainly inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. However, the description of the molecular mechanisms involved in eCB control of MC activation is far from complete. In this review, we aim to summarize the available information regarding the role of eCBs in the modulation of FcεRI-dependent activation of that cell type, emphasizing the description of the eCB system and the existence of some of its elements in MCs. Unique characteristics of the eCB system and cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) localization and signaling in MCs are mentioned. The described and putative points of cross-talk between CBRs and FcεRI signaling cascades are also presented. Finally, we discuss some important considerations in the study of the effects of eCBs in MCs and the perspectives in the field.

Abstract: Summary
Thermal energy storage systems are an emerging option for efficient energy conversion and storage, especially if they can concentrate solar energy. This work studies a flexible CH3OH-to-CH4 conversion system from intermediate conversion to synthesis gas. The design is based on a combination of processes already tested experimentally and applied in industry. The concept we develop integrates the decomposition of CH3OH and methanation processes, providing different pathways for energy use, such as natural gas, direct heat, and power supply, or storage in chemical bonds. This flexibility in adapting the operation of the system to different energy availability and energy needs makes the concept appealing for changeable application. Thermal efficiencies of 39% are possible for the CH3OH decomposition phase and of 26% for the overall system for CH4 production. Thus, from the high energy density of CH3OH, levelized storage costs of €134.8/MWh can be obtained, which is lower than systems based on molten salts. These results should spur interest in further advances for the proposed flexible concept.

Abstract: Summary
Given the security issues caused by electrostatic discharge in electron devices, triboelectrification has attracted extensive attention as a new energy-generation and -collection method. However, high output impedance and low current density will hinder its further development and limit many practical applications. Here, we report an effective method to circumvent these limitations by introducing a vacuum environment into relative movements. By combining discharge, the tribocurrent has two or three orders of magnitude enhancement during different triboelectrification processes. In traditional devices, the vacuum sliding triboelectric nanogenerator (VS-TENG) exhibits an ultrahigh average power of 173.8 W m−2·Hz−1 and sets a record of the triboelectrification driven by rotate mode. By shrinking the vacuum environment into a vacuum silicon tube, the current density of conventional TENGs can span from the microamp to the milliamp level. This work develops a universal strategy to enhance the output performance in energy harvesting.

Abstract: Summary
Perfluoroalkyl-containing organic molecules are important for a wide range of applications in pharmaceuticals and organic functional materials. In this study, an unconventional electroreductive fluoroalkylative heteroarylation of unactivated alkenes via a remote heteroaryl migration is developed. A series of heteroaryls can migrate smoothly, and various fluoroalkyls can be introduced into products. Compared with classical thermochemistry and photochemistry, electrochemistry uses generation of radicals and subsequent radical addition to unactivated alkenes, and heteroaryl migration and hydrogen atom abstraction occur in a small reductive area near the cathode. This approach contributes to the broad substrate scope. Deuterium-labeling experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that N,N-dimethylformamide provides hydrogen atoms for the quenching of carbon radicals after migration instead of water or tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. A migrated benzothiazole moiety can be transformed into a formyl group, and a facile synthesis can generate substituted cyclopentanone.

Abstract: Summary
Electrochemistry is a useful technique for mild synthesis of polymers, but the mechanisms of electrochemical polymerization are challenging to fully understand. Here, we focus on understanding the reaction mechanisms during the electrochemical polymerization of polyhydrocarbons. The overall synthetic pathway for hyperbranched polyhydrocarbons is investigated using electrochemical methods combined with spectroscopy, namely nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR). The oxidation and reduction occurring on the anode and cathode are investigated by cyclic voltammetry and NMR analyses to distinguish the functions of each electrode at the reaction initiation. Real-time FT-IR measurements during electrochemical polymerization are used to decipher the propagation steps. The termination by various suppliers of hydrogen atoms (such as aqueous hydrochloric acid) is examined via NMR spectroscopy using deuterium-labeled acetonitrile and chloroform. The participation of chlorinated methanes and of the solvent acetonitrile in the electrochemical polymerization is interrogated. Overall, these findings advance understanding of the key steps in the polymerization reaction.

Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a pro-inflammatory state associated with organ failure, thrombosis, and death. We investigated a novel inflammatory biomarker, γ′ fibrinogen (GPF), in 103 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and 19 healthy controls. We found significant associations between GPF levels and the severity of COVID-19 as judged by blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). The mean level of GPF in the patients with COVID-19 was significantly higher than in controls (69.8 (95 % CI 64.8–74.8) mg/dL compared with 36.9 (95 % CI 31.4–42.4) mg/dL, p < 0.0001), whereas C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and total fibrinogen levels were not significantly different between groups. Mean GPF levels were significantly highest in patients with severe COVID-19 (SpO2 ≤ 93 %, GPF 75.2 (95 % CI 68.7–81.8) mg/dL), compared to mild/moderate COVID-19 (SpO2 > 93 %, GPF 62.5 (95 % CI 55.0–70.0) mg/dL, p = 0.01, AUC of 0.68, 95 % CI 0.57–0.78; Youden's index cutpoint 62.9 mg/dL, sensitivity 0.64, specificity 0.63). In contrast, CRP, interleukin-6, ferritin, LDH, D-dimers, and total fibrinogen had weaker associations with COVID-19 disease severity (all ROC curves with lower AUCs). Thus, GPF may be a useful inflammatory marker of COVID-19 respiratory disease severity.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding and controlling the impact that electrostatic interactions have on the transport of injected charge carriers is important for the utilization of pi-conjugated semiconductors in opto-electronic applications. Here, we explore the impact of dopant chemical and electronic structure on the doping efficacy and charge carrier transport in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (s-SWCNT) networks using molecular charge-transfer dopants based on functionalized icosahedral dodecaborane (DDB) clusters. Calculations indicate that localization of electron density on the DDB core reduces the coulombic interactions that contribute to hole localization in the s-SWCNTs, thereby improving charge carrier transport. The enhanced delocalization produces an increase in the electrical conductivity and thermopower at lower charge carrier densities, yielding enhanced thermoelectric transport and a thermoelectric power factor that surpasses the previous best in class for enriched s-SWCNT thin-film networks. This strategy can be applied broadly across pi-conjugated semiconductors to tune and enhance performance in a variety of energy harvesting devices.

Abstract: The expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is altered in multiple chronic kidney diseases like hypertension and renal fibrosis, where the signaling from the basal membrane proteins is critical for the development and progression of the various pathologies. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors that have important roles in the progression of these chronic kidney diseases by altering various cell signaling pathways in response to changes in the basement membrane proteins. It is unclear whether integrin or integrin-mediated signaling affects the ACE2 expression in the kidney. The current study tests the hypothesis that integrin β1 regulates the expression of ACE2 in kidney epithelial cells. The role of integrin β1 in ACE2 expression in renal epithelial cells was investigated by shRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacological inhibition. In vivo studies were carried out using epithelial cell-specific deletion of integrin β1 in the kidneys. Deletion of integrin β1 from the mouse renal epithelial cells reduced the expression of ACE2 in the kidney. Furthermore, the downregulation of integrin β1 using shRNA decreased ACE2 expression in human renal epithelial cells. ACE2 expression levels were also decreased in renal epithelial cells and cancer cells when treated with an integrin α2β1 antagonist, BTT 3033. SARS-CoV-2 viral entry to human renal epithelial cells and cancer cells was also inhibited by BTT 3033. This study demonstrates that integrin β1 positively regulates the expression of ACE2, which is required for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into kidney cells.

Abstract: The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), collectively referred to as Batten disease, are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that primarily affect children. The etiology of Batten disease is linked to mutations in 13 genes that encode distinct CLN proteins, whose functions have yet to be fully elucidated. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has been adopted as an efficient and powerful model system for studying the diverse cellular roles of CLN proteins. The genome of D. discoideum encodes several homologs of human CLN proteins, and a growing body of literature supports the conserved roles and networking of CLN proteins in D. discoideum and humans. In humans, CLN proteins have diverse cellular roles related to autophagy, signal transduction, lipid homeostasis, lysosomal ion homeostasis, and intracellular trafficking. Recent work also indicates that CLN proteins play an important role in protein secretion. Remarkably, many of these findings have found parallels in studies with D. discoideum. Accordingly, this review will highlight the translatable value of novel work with D. discoideum in the field of NCL research and propose further avenues of research using this biomedical model organism for studying the NCLs.

Abstract: Summary
Heterogeneous catalytic pyrolysis of hydrocarbons to produce CO2-free hydrogen and high-quality solid carbon have historically been stymied by issues related to catalyst deactivation by carbon formed during pyrolysis on the catalyst surface. In addition, a system that demonstrates sustained performance in terms of high conversion, high H2 yield, and high quality of produced carbon has remained elusive. Here, we propose and demonstrate a semi-continuous methane pyrolysis process to H2 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) consisting of repeated pyrolysis and in situ (i.e., within the reactor) CNT dislodging by vigorous steam/argon fluidization. With this process, we demonstrate 10 process cycles with high H2 yield from CH4 and CNT dislodging in a fluidized-bed reactor with an Fe/θ-Al2O3 catalyst synthesized by an easily scalable incipient wetness impregnation process. We also identify and present opportunities for future catalyst and process development.

Abstract: The small GTPase RhoB is distinguished from other Rho proteins by its unique subcellular localization in endosomes, multivesicular bodies, and nucleus. Despite high sequence homology with RhoA and RhoC, RhoB is mainly associated with tumor suppressive function, while RhoA and RhoC support oncogenic transformation in most malignancies. RhoB regulates the endocytic trafficking of signaling molecules and cytoskeleton remodeling, thereby controlling growth, apoptosis, stress response, immune function, and cell motility in various contexts. Some of these functions may be ascribed to RhoB’s unique subcellular localization to endocytic compartments. Here we describe the pleiotropic roles of RhoB in cancer suppression in the context of its subcellular localization, and we discuss possible therapeutic avenues to pursue and highlight priorities for future research.

Abstract: Summary
Essential for Darwin’s “struggle for existence,” the competitive exclusion principle (CEP) states that any “two species occupying the same niche will compete with each other to the detriment of one of the species, which will thus be excluded.” Here, we report on competition experiments between two populations of autonomous, artificial, self-booting, self-reproducing polymer-based protocells emerging from a homogeneous blend of small synthetic chemicals in a one-pot reactor using polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). These protocells are carbon chemistry based but biochemistry free. The populations share their environment, differing only in that one contains a photocatalyst that confers advantages in reproduction. Competition in the shared environment follows the CEP. Thus, biochemistry is sufficient, not necessary, to drive the CEP. This has implications for protocell research, the origin and early evolution of life, and the laboratory synthesis of life and also relaxes constraints for the potential presence and evolution of generalized life in exoplanets.

Abstract: Summary
Cryoprotectants are vital to ensuring that biological tissue can survive liquid nitrogen exposure during cryopreservation and subsequent warming. The fundamental interaction between cryoprotectants, cells, and shoot tips is an understudied area, and the exact mechanism for protection remains elusive. By coupling coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy with bright-field microscopy, we determine how quickly the widely used cryoprotectants dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylene glycol, and glycerol permeate living rice (Oryza sativa) callus cells and how this permeation correlates with cellular responses. Some cellular responses observed with bright-field microscopy, such as plasmolysis and deplasmolysis, occur in response to cryoprotectant permeation. The observational results from the combination of bright-field and coherent anti-Stokes Raman microscopy reported here show that cryoprotectant permeation occurs before the end of plasmolysis and well before the end of deplasmolysis. Further, cryoprotectants permeate cells where there is no apparent plasmolysis and deplasmolysis. Overall, cell response times are substantially longer than permeation times.

Abstract: Summary
While vehicle cabin environment significantly impacts human health, systematic studies on this important microenvironment are lacking. Here, we conduct a 12-day field observation of a new car under varying environmental conditions. Concentrations of 20 common volatile organic compounds are determined. Levels of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde exceed the suggested limit, with 34.9% and 60.5% over the standard rate, respectively. By combining an improved multi-source model with quantitative correlations between three key parameters of volatile compound emissions from various in-cabin materials and temperatures, we predict formaldehyde concentrations at different temperatures, which are consistent with measurements. We find that volatile compound emission characteristics are dependent on material surface temperature rather than the widely used metric of air temperature. This study probes volatile compound variability in a realistic vehicle cabin via observation and modeling and estimates in-cabin incremental lifetime cancer risk via three exposure routes, indicating a high health risk for drivers.

Abstract: Introduction
The time elapsed from diagnosis to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is influenced by numerous factors. In Brazil, patients using the public health system are also dependent on the availability of HSCT-specific beds in the hematology ward.
Objective and Methods
We conducted a cohort study of listed patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT at a Brazilian public hospital to investigate the impact of the waitlist time on post-HSCT survival.
Results
The median time from diagnosis to HSCT was 19 months (IQR, 10 - 43), of which 6 months (IQR, 3 - 9) were spent on the waitlist. The time on the waitlist for HSCT appeared to influence mainly the survival of adult patients (≥ 18 years), with an increasing risk according to this time (RR, 3.53 and 95%CI, 1.81 - 6.88 for > 3 and ≤ 6 months; RR 5.86 and 95%CI, 3.26 - 10.53 for > 6 and ≤ 12 months, and; RR 4.24 and 95%CI, 2.32 - 7.75 for > 12 months).
Conclusion
Patients who remained on the waitlist for less than 3 months had the highest survival (median survival, 856 days; IQR, 131 - 1607). The risk of reduced survival was about 6-fold higher (95%CI, 2.8 - 11.5) in patients with malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are promising inorganic electrochromic materials (ECMs) that can be widely used in smart windows, adaptive camouflage, electronic displays, energy storage, etc. However, there are still huge challenges for TMOs to simultaneously achieve high performance of electrochromism and cyclic stability. Herein, we successfully synthesize single tungsten (W) atom-modified hydrangea-like porous vanadium pentoxide nanoflowers (HLP-W/V2O5) with high loading content of W atoms (13.7%). The HLP-W/V2O5-based ECMs exhibit enhanced EC performance with three reversible color transformations (yellow, blue, and brown) at a voltage lower than 1.2 V and outstanding cyclic stability (10,000 cycles without significant attenuation). This work provides a feasible strategy for the efficient preparation of high-performance and durable TMO-based ECMs.

Abstract: Summary
The extremely short lifetime of plasmon-induced charges is a huge challenge to surface plasmon resonance photocatalytic water oxidation. Here, we report that increasing oxygen vacancies (VO) in Au/TiO2-x can greatly enhance the external quantum efficiency of plasmon-induced water oxidation from 0.03% to 1.52% at 520 nm. The increased VO can achieve efficient transportation of plasmonic electrons in the conduction band of TiO2-x with enhanced conductivity and can boost the oxygen evolution kinetics of Au/TiO2-x. The dynamics of plasmonic electrons derived from interband transition reveal that holes in the d-band of Au nanoparticles (NPs) can transfer to the defect states near the valence band of TiO2-x, which originate from VO at the interface of Au/TiO2-x. This process could enrich holes at the interface, making it possible to collect multiple holes for water oxidation. The synchronous functions in hole capture and water molecule adsorption enable VO to be efficient catalytic sites for plasmon-induced water oxidation.

Abstract: Objective
This study endeavored to assess the lipid profile and atherogenic lipid indexes in children with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and to compare them with matched healthy children.
Method
The study group consisted of a total of 72 TDT patients aged 3 to14 years, while the control group had 83 age- and sex-matched healthy children. The fasting lipid profile and lipid indexes were estimated and the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), Castelli's risk indexes I and II, atherogenic coefficient were calculated and compared between the two groups.
Result
Compared to the control group, the mean LDL, HDL and cholesterol levels were significantly lower among the case group (p-value < 0.001). The mean VLDL and triglycerides were significantly higher in the case group (p-value < 0.001). Lipid indexes, including the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), Castelli's risk indexes I and II and atherogenic coefficients were significantly higher in TDT children.
Conclusion
Dyslipidemia and increased risk of atherosclerosis were found in TDT children, as they had elevated atherogenic lipid indexes. Our study underlines the importance of the routine use of these indexes in TDT children. Future studies should focus on lipid indexes in this high-lipid group of children so that preventive strategies can be planned accordingly.

Abstract: Summary
High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of metallic materials that demonstrate potentially very useful functional and structural properties. Sluggish diffusion, one of the core effects responsible for their exotic properties, has been intensively debated. Here, we demonstrate that a combination of machine learning (ML) and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) can uncover the complicated links between the rough potential energy landscape (PEL) and atomic transport in HEAs. The ML model accurately represents the local environment dependence of PEL, and the developed ML-kMC allows us to reach the timescale required to reveal how composition-dependent PEL governs self-diffusion in HEAs. We further delineate a species-resolved analytical diffusion model that can capture essential features of self-diffusion in arbitrary alloy composition and temperature in HEAs. This work elucidates the governing mechanism for sluggish diffusion in HEAs, which enables efficient and accurate manipulation of diffusion properties in HEAs by tailoring alloy composition and corresponding PEL.

Abstract: Introduction
Beta-thalassemia major patients need a regular blood transfusion to have an initial normal growth. However, these patients have an increased risk of developing alloantibodies. Our main goal was to study HLA alloimmunization in Moroccan Beta-thalassemia patients by confronting it with transfusion and demographic criteria, exploring the involvement of HLA typing profile in the development of HLA antibodies and in turn determining risk factors for their development.
Methods
The study consisted of 53 Moroccan pediatric patients with Beta-thalassemia major. Screening for HLA alloantibodies was performed using Luminex technology Whereas HLA genotyping was done with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP). Results: In this study, 50.9% of patients have been identified as positive for HLA antibodies, with 59.3% having both HLA Class I and Class II antibodies. A significant increase frequency of DRB1*11 allele was revealed in non-immunized patients (34.6% vs. 0%, p = 0.001). Our results also revealed that the majority of our HLA immunized patients were women (72.4% vs. 27.6%, p = 0.001), and transfused with more than 300 units of RBC units (66.7% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.02). There were statistically significant differences when comparing these frequencies.
Conclusions
This paper revealed that the transfusion dependent Beta-thalassemia major patients are exposed to risk of developing HLA antibodies following transfusions with leukoreduced RBC units. The HLA DRB1*11 was a protective factor against HLA alloimmunization in our beta-thalassemia major patients.

Abstract: Summary
Topological quantum materials have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, most of their performance is behind noble metals such as benchmark platinum (Pt). Here, we report a molecular-beam-epitaxy- and electron-beam-evaporation-grown Pd(20nm)/SnTe(70nm) heterostructure that displays a higher electrocatalytic activity than that of a pure Pd(20nm) thin film, and higher than that of a commercial Pt foil. Density functional theory calculations show that the topological surface states (TSSs) of the SnTe (001) play a key role. Electron transfer from both Pd and adsorbed H atoms to the TSSs results in weaker Pd-H binding and more favorable ΔGH. Our work demonstrates that a metal/topological material heterostructure could be a prominent catalyst to enjoy HER activity outperforming that of Pt and offers a promising direction to optimize the performance of electrocatalysts based on topological quantum materials.

Riluzole treatment modulates KCC2 and EAAT-2 receptor expression and Ca2+ accumulation following ventral root avulsion injury,

Abstract: Avulsion injury results in motoneuron death due to the increased excitotoxicity developing in the affected spinal segments. This study focused on possible short and long term molecular and receptor expression alterations which are thought to be linked to the excitotoxic events in the ventral horn with or without the anti-excitotoxic riluzole treatment. In our experimental model the left lumbar 4 and 5 (L4, 5) ventral roots of the spinal cord were avulsed. Treated animals received riluzole for 2 weeks. Riluzole is a compound that acts to block voltage-activated Na+ and Ca2+ channels. In control animals the L4, 5 ventral roots were avulsed without riluzole treatment. Expression of astrocytic EAAT-2 and that of KCC2 in motoneurons on the affected side of the L4 spinal segment were detected after the injury by confocal and dSTORM imaging, intracellular Ca2+ levels in motoneurons were quantified by electron microscopy. The KCC2 labeling in the lateral and ventrolateral parts of the L4 ventral horn was weaker compared with the medial part of L4 ventral horn in both groups. Riluzole treatment dramatically enhanced motoneuron survival but was not able to prevent the down-regulation of KCC2 expression in injured motoneurons. In contrast, riluzole successfully obviated the increase of intracellular calcium level and the decrease of EAAT-2 expression in astrocytes compared with untreated injured animals. We conclude that KCC2 may not be an essential component for survival of injured motoneurons and riluzole is able to modulate the intracellular level of calcium and expression of EAAT-2.

Abstract: Background
In sub-Saharan Africa, the prevailing high ambient temperatures should warrant increased daily water intake (DWI) to prevent haemo-concentration and its potential to confound patients' laboratory data.
Aim
To assess the impact that the recommended DWI has on the haemato-biochemical variables in a tropical setting.
Materials and methods
This quasi-experimental study recruited 101 apparently healthy individuals (18–60 years) in the Bawku municipality. DWI, anthropometrics, and haemato-biochemical variables were assessed at baseline. Participants were encouraged to increase their DWI to ≥4 L over a 30-day period; haemato-biochemical variables were re-evaluated. Total body water (TBW) was anthropometrically estimated.
Results
The median post-treatment DWI significantly increased; consequently, anaemia cases increased by >20-fold (2.0 % vs 47.5 % post-treatment). RBC count, platelet count, WBC count, and median haemoglobin significantly decreased compared to baseline (p < 0.0001). Biochemically, median plasma osmolality (p < 0.0001), serum sodium (p < 0.0001), serum potassium (p = 0.0012) and random blood sugar (p = 0.0403) significantly decreased. Compared to baseline, significantly higher proportion of participants classified as thrombocytopenic (8.9 % vs 3.0 %), hyponatraemia (10.9 % vs 2.0 %), or normal osmolarity (77.2 % vs 20.8 %). There were differential bivariate correlations between pre- and post-treatment haemato-biochemical variables.
Conclusion
Sub-optimal DWI is a likely confounder in haemato-biochemical data interpretation in the tropics.
