Abstract: Summary
In Escherichia coli, RNA degradation often begins with conversion of the 5′-terminal triphosphate to a monophosphate, creating a better substrate for internal cleavage by RNase E. Remarkably, no homolog of this key endonuclease is present in many bacterial species, such as Bacillus subtilis and various pathogens. Here, we report that the degradation of primary transcripts in B. subtilis can nevertheless be triggered by an analogous process to generate a short-lived, monophosphorylated intermediate. Like its E. coli counterpart, the B. subtilis RNA pyrophosphohydrolase that catalyzes this event is a Nudix protein that prefers unpaired 5′ ends. However, in B. subtilis, this modification exposes transcripts to rapid 5′ exonucleolytic degradation by RNase J, which is absent in E. coli but present in most bacteria lacking RNase E. This pathway, which closely resembles the mechanism by which deadenylated mRNA is degraded in eukaryotic cells, explains the stabilizing influence of 5′-terminal stem-loops in such bacteria.

Abstract: Albumin, which is the most abundant component of urine proteins, exerts injurious effects on renal cells in chronic kidney diseases. However, the toxicity of albumin to podocytes is not well elucidated. Here, we show that a high concentration of albumin triggers intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) increase through mechanisms involving the intracellular calcium store release and extracellular calcium influx in conditionally immortalized podocytes. The canonical transient receptor potential-6 (TRPC6) channel, which is associated with a subset of familial forms of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and several acquired proteinuric kidney diseases, was shown to be one of the important Ca2+ permeable ion channels in podocytes. Therefore we explored the role of TRPC6 on albumin-induced functional and structural changes in podocytes. It was found that albumin-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was blocked by TRPC6 siRNA or SKF-96365, a blocker of TRP cation channels. Long-term albumin exposure caused an up-regulation of TRPC6 expression in podocytes, which was inhibited by TRPC6 siRNA. Additionally, the inhibition of TRPC6 prevented the F-actin cytoskeleton disruption that is induced by albumin overload. Moreover, albumin overload induced expression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress protein GRP78, led to caspase-12 activation and ultimately podocyte apoptosis, all of which were abolished by the knockdown of TRPC6 using TRPC6 siRNA. These results support the view that albumin overload may induce ER stress and the subsequent apoptosis in podocytes via TRPC6-mediated Ca2+ entry.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) is a member of the gp130 family of cytokines. We observed that ct-1−/− mice develop mature-onset obesity, insulin resistance, and hypercholesterolemia despite reduced calorie intake. Decreased energy expenditure preceded and accompanied the development of obesity. Acute treatment with rCT-1 decreased blood glucose in an insulin-independent manner and increased insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in muscle. These changes were associated with stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, an effect that was absent in AMPKα2−/− mice. Chronic rCT-1 treatment reduced food intake, enhanced energy expenditure, and induced white adipose tissue remodeling characterized by upregulation of genes implicated in the control of lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis and genes typifying brown fat phenotype. Moreover, rCT-1 reduced body weight and corrected insulin resistance in ob/ob and in high-fat-fed obese mice. We conclude that CT-1 is a master regulator of fat and glucose metabolism with potential applications for treatment of obesity and insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The Drosophila ecdysone receptor (EcR/Usp) is thought to activate or repress gene transcription depending on the presence or absence, respectively, of the hormone ecdysone. Unexpectedly, we found an alternative mechanism at work in salivary glands during the ecdysone-dependent transition from larvae to pupae. In the absense of ecdysone, both ecdysone receptor subunits localize to the cytoplasm, and the heme-binding nuclear receptor E75A replaces EcR/Usp at common target sequences in several genes. During the larval-pupal transition, a switch from gene activation by EcR/Usp to gene repression by E75A is triggered by a decrease in ecdysone concentration and by direct repression of the EcR gene by E75A. Additional control is provided by developmentally timed modulation of E75A activity by NO, which inhibits recruitment of the corepressor SMRTER. These results suggest a mechanism for sequential modulation of gene expression during development by competing nuclear receptors and their effector molecules, ecdysone and NO.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor immune surveillance and cancer immunotherapies are thought to depend on the intratumoral infiltration of activated CD8+ T cells. Intratumoral CD8+ T cells are rare and lack activity. IL-10 is thought to contribute to the underlying immune suppressive microenvironment. Defying those expectations we demonstrate that IL-10 induces several essential mechanisms for effective antitumor immune surveillance: infiltration and activation of intratumoral tumor-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, expression of the Th1 cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) and granzymes in CD8+ T cells, and intratumoral antigen presentation molecules. Consequently, tumor immune surveillance is weakened in mice deficient for IL-10 whereas transgenic overexpression of IL-10 protects mice from carcinogenesis. Treatment with pegylated IL-10 restores tumor-specific intratumoral CD8+ T cell function and controls tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression through translation repression and mRNA destabilization. However, the molecular mechanisms of miRNA silencing are still not well defined. Using a genetic screen in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, we identify mammalian hyperplastic discs protein EDD, a known E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a key component of the miRNA silencing pathway. ES cells deficient for EDD are defective in miRNA function and exhibit growth defects. We demonstrate that E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is dispensable for EDD function in miRNA silencing. Instead, EDD interacts with GW182 family proteins in the Argonaute-miRNA complexes. The PABC domain of EDD is essential for its silencing function. Through the PABC domain, EDD participates in miRNA silencing by recruiting downstream effectors. Among the PABC-interactors, DDX6 and Tob1/2 are both required and sufficient for silencing mRNA targets. Taken together, these data demonstrate a critical function for EDD in miRNA silencing.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which ubiquitin ligases are regulated remain poorly understood. Here we describe a series of molecular events that coordinately regulate CHIP, a neuroprotective E3 implicated in protein quality control. Through their opposing activities, the initiator E2, Ube2w, and the specialized deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), ataxin-3, participate in initiating, regulating, and terminating the CHIP ubiquitination cycle. Monoubiquitination of CHIP by Ube2w stabilizes the interaction between CHIP and ataxin-3, which through its DUB activity limits the length of chains attached to CHIP substrates. Upon completion of substrate ubiquitination, ataxin-3 deubiquitinates CHIP, effectively terminating the reaction. Our results suggest that functional pairing of E3s with ataxin-3 or similar DUBs represents an important point of regulation in ubiquitin-dependent protein quality control. In addition, the results shed light on disease pathogenesis in SCA3, a neurodegenerative disorder caused by polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-3.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian cells express dozens of iron-containing proteins, yet little is known about the mechanism of metal ligand incorporation. Human poly (rC) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) is an iron chaperone that binds iron and delivers it to ferritin, a cytosolic iron storage protein. We have identified the iron-dependent prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and asparaginyl hydroxylase (FIH1) that modify hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIFα) as targets of PCBP1. Depletion of PCBP1 or PCBP2 in cells led to loss of PHD activity, manifested by reduced prolyl hydroxylation of HIF1α, impaired degradation of HIF1α through the VHL/proteasome pathway, and accumulation of active HIF1 transcription factor. PHD activity was restored in vitro by addition of excess Fe(II), or purified Fe-PCBP1, and PCBP1 bound to PHD2 and FIH1 in vivo. These data indicated that PCBP1 was required for iron incorporation into PHD and suggest a broad role for PCBP1 and 2 in delivering iron to cytosolic nonheme iron enzymes.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling plays an important role in angiogenesis. In the VEGF signaling pathway, the key components are VEGF and its receptors, Flt-1 and KDR. In this study, we show that transfection of synthetic miR-200b reduced protein levels of VEGF, Flt-1, and KDR. In A549 cells, miR-200b targeted the predicted binding sites in the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) of VEGF, Flt-1, and KDR as revealed by a luciferase reporter assay. When transfected with miR-200b, the ability of HUVECs to form a capillary tube on Matrigel and VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 were significantly reduced. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-200b negatively regulates VEGF signaling by targeting VEGF and its receptors and that miR-200b may have therapeutic potential as an angiogenesis inhibitor.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy and apoptosis constitute important determinants of cell fate and engage in a complex interplay in both physiological and pathological settings. The molecular basis of this crosstalk is poorly understood and relies, in part, on “dual-function” proteins that operate in both processes. Here, we identify the essential autophagy protein Atg12 as a positive mediator of mitochondrial apoptosis and show that Atg12 directly regulates the apoptotic pathway by binding and inactivating prosurvival Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. The binding occurs independently of Atg5 or Atg3 and requires a unique BH3-like motif in Atg12, characterized by interaction studies and computational docking. In apoptotic cells, knockdown of Atg12 inhibited Bax activation and cytochrome c release, while ectopic expression of Atg12 antagonized the antiapoptotic activity of Mcl-1. The interaction between Atg12 and Bcl-2 family members may thus constitute an important point of convergence between autophagy and apoptosis in response to specific signals.

Abstract: Summary
The maintenance of H3K9 and DNA methylation at imprinting control regions (ICRs) during early embryogenesis is key to the regulation of imprinted genes. Here, we reveal that ZFP57, its cofactor KAP1, and associated effectors bind selectively to the H3K9me3-bearing, DNA-methylated allele of ICRs in ES cells. KAP1 deletion induces a loss of heterochromatin marks at ICRs, whereas deleting ZFP57 or DNMTs leads to ICR DNA demethylation. Accordingly, we find that ZFP57 and KAP1 associated with DNMTs and hemimethylated DNA-binding NP95. Finally, we identify the methylated TGCCGC hexanucleotide as the motif that is recognized by ZFP57 in all ICRs and in several tens of additional loci, several of which are at least ZFP57-dependently methylated in ES cells. These results significantly advance our understanding of imprinting and suggest a general mechanism for the protection of specific loci against the wave of DNA demethylation that affects the mammalian genome during early embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The signaling adaptor p62 is a critical mediator of important cellular functions, owing to its ability to establish interactions with various signaling intermediaries. Here, we identify raptor as an interacting partner of p62. Thus, p62 is an integral part of the mTORC1 complex and is necessary to mediate amino acid signaling for the activation of S6K1 and 4EBP1. p62 interacts in an amino acid-dependent manner with mTOR and raptor. In addition, p62 binds the Rags proteins and favors formation of the active Rag heterodimer that is further stabilized by raptor. Interestingly, p62 colocalizes with Rags at the lysosomal compartment and is required for the interaction of mTOR with Rag GTPases in vivo and for translocation of the mTORC1 complex to the lysosome, a crucial step for mTOR activation.

Abstract: The generation of various subtypes of neurons and glial cells at the right time and place is crucial for the proper development of the vertebrate CNS. Although the mechanisms and factors for the regulation of neuronal diversity in the CNS have been well studied, the mechanisms regulating the sequential production of neuronal and glial cells from neural precursors remain poorly understood. This study shows that Tcf3, a member of the Lef/Tcf family of proteins, is required to inhibit the premature oligodendroglial fate specification of spinal cord precursors using the transgenic zebrafish, which expresses a dominant repressor form of Tcf3 under the control of a heat-shock inducible promoter. In addition, the data revealed that Tcf3 function in oligodendroglial fate specification is mediated independently of canonical Wnt signaling. Altogether, these results show a novel function for Tcf3 in regulating the timing of oligodendroglial fate specification in the spinal cord.

Abstract: Summary
Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes are coactivators that are important for transcriptional activation by modifying chromatin. Metazoan SAGA and ATAC are distinct multisubunits complexes that share the same catalytic HAT subunit (GCN5 or PCAF). Here, we show that these human HAT complexes are targeted to different genomic loci representing functionally distinct regulatory elements both at broadly expressed and tissue-specific genes. While SAGA can principally be found at promoters, ATAC is recruited to promoters and enhancers, yet only its enhancer binding is cell-type specific. Furthermore, we show that ATAC functions at a set of enhancers that are not bound by p300, revealing a class of enhancers not yet identified. These findings demonstrate important functional differences between SAGA and ATAC coactivator complexes at the level of the genome and define a role for the ATAC complex in the regulation of a set of enhancers.

Abstract: The Transient Receptor Potential Canonical 5 (TRPC5) protein forms calcium-permeable cationic channels that are stimulated by G protein-coupled receptor agonists. The signaling pathways of such agonist effects are poorly understood. Here we investigated the potential for involvement of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and arachidonic acid generated by group 6 (GVI) phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes, focusing on stimulation of TRPC5 by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) which acts via a pertussis toxin-sensitive (Gi/o protein) pathway without Ca2+-release. Experiments were on HEK 293 cells containing conditional expression of human TRPC5. Channel activity was recorded using an intracellular calcium indicator or whole-cell patch-clamp and PLA2 activity was detected using 3H-arachidonic acid. S1P stimulated PLA2 and TRPC5 activities. Both effects were suppressed by the GVI PLA2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone. Knock-down of GVI PLA2 by RNA interference suppressed channel activity evoked by S1P whereas activity evoked by the direct channel stimulator LPC was unaffected. Arachidonic acid did not stimulate the channels. Prior exposure of channels to LPC but not arachidonic acid suppressed channel activity evoked by S1P but not gadolinium, a putative direct stimulator of the channels. The data suggest roles of LPC and GVI PLA2 in S1P-evoked TRPC5 activity.

Abstract: Summary
We report that diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) commonly fails to express cell-surface molecules necessary for the recognition of tumor cells by immune-effector cells. In 29% of cases, mutations and deletions inactivate the β2-Microglobulin gene, thus preventing the cell-surface expression of the HLA class-I (HLA-I) complex that is necessary for recognition by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. In 21% of cases, analogous lesions involve the CD58 gene, which encodes a molecule involved in T and natural killer cell-mediated responses. In addition to gene inactivation, alternative mechanisms lead to aberrant expression of HLA-I and CD58 in >60% of DLBCL. These two events are significantly associated in this disease, suggesting that they are coselected during lymphomagenesis for their combined role in escape from immune-surveillance.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) are cellular storage organelles for neutral lipids that vary in size and abundance according to cellular needs. Physiological conditions that promote lipid storage rapidly and markedly increase LD volume and surface. How the need for surface phospholipids is sensed and balanced during this process is unknown. Here, we show that phosphatidylcholine (PC) acts as a surfactant to prevent LD coalescence, which otherwise yields large, lipolysis-resistant LDs and triglyceride (TG) accumulation. The need for additional PC to coat the enlarging surface during LD expansion is provided by the Kennedy pathway, which is activated by reversible targeting of the rate-limiting enzyme, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), to growing LD surfaces. The requirement, targeting, and activation of CCT to growing LDs were similar in cells of Drosophila and mice. Our results reveal a mechanism to maintain PC homeostasis at the expanding LD monolayer through targeted activation of a key PC synthesis enzyme.

Abstract: Summary
Using a mouse model recapitulating the main features of human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), we uncover the hierarchy of leukemic stem and progenitor cells contributing to disease pathogenesis. We refine the characterization of CML leukemic stem cells (LSCs) to the most immature long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and identify some important molecular deregulations underlying their aberrant behavior. We find that CML multipotent progenitors (MPPs) exhibit an aberrant B-lymphoid potential but are redirected toward the myeloid lineage by the action of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. We show that BCR/ABL activity controls Il-6 expression thereby establishing a paracrine feedback loop that sustains CML development. These results describe how proinflammatory tumor environment affects leukemic progenitor cell fate and contributes to CML pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
piRNAs guide PIWI proteins to silence transposons in animal germ cells. Reciprocal cycles of piRNA-directed RNA cleavage—catalyzed by the PIWI proteins Aubergine (Aub) and Argonaute3 (Ago3) in Drosophila melanogaster—expand the population of antisense piRNAs in response to transposon expression, a process called the Ping-Pong cycle. Heterotypic Ping-Pong between Aub and Ago3 ensures that antisense piRNAs predominate. We show that qin, a piRNA pathway gene whose protein product contains both E3 ligase and Tudor domains, colocalizes with Aub and Ago3 in nuage, a perinuclear structure implicated in transposon silencing. In qin mutants, less Ago3 binds Aub, futile Aub:Aub homotypic Ping-Pong prevails, antisense piRNAs decrease, many families of mobile genetic elements are reactivated, and DNA damage accumulates in nurse cells and oocytes. We propose that Qin enforces heterotypic Ping-Pong between Aub and Ago3, ensuring that transposons are silenced and maintaining the integrity of the germline genome.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin E is a component of the core cell cycle machinery, and it drives cell proliferation by regulating entry and progression of cells through the DNA synthesis phase. Cyclin E expression is normally restricted to proliferating cells. However, high levels of cyclin E are expressed in the adult brain. The function of cyclin E in quiescent, postmitotic nervous system remains unknown. Here we use a combination of in vivo quantitative proteomics and analyses of cyclin E knockout mice to demonstrate that in terminally differentiated neurons cyclin E forms complexes with Cdk5 and controls synapse function by restraining Cdk5 activity. Ablation of cyclin E led to a decreased number of synapses, reduced number and volume of dendritic spines, and resulted in impaired synaptic plasticity and memory formation in cyclin E-deficient animals. These results reveal a cell cycle-independent role for a core cell cycle protein, cyclin E, in synapse function and memory.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis requires pairing, synapsis, and crossing-over. In C. elegans, homolog pairing and synapsis depend on pairing centers (PCs), special regions near one end of each chromosome that interact with the nuclear envelope (NE) and cytoplasmic microtubules. Here, we report that PCs are required for nuclear reorganization at the onset of meiosis. We demonstrate that PCs recruit the Polo-like kinase PLK-2 to induce NE remodeling, chromosome pairing, and synapsis. Recruitment of PLK-2 is also required to mediate a cell cycle delay and selective apoptosis of nuclei containing unsynapsed chromosomes, establishing a molecular link between these two quality control mechanisms. This work reveals unexpected functions for the conserved family of Polo-like kinases, and advances our understanding of how meiotic processes are properly coordinated to ensure transmission of genetic information from parents to progeny.

Abstract: A typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (2-Cys Prx)-like protein (PpPrx) that alternatively acts as a peroxidase or a molecular chaperone in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was previously characterized. The dual functions of PpPrx are regulated by the existence of an additional Cys112 between the active Cys51 and Cys171 residues. In the present study, additional Cys residues (Cys31, Cys112, and Cys192) were added to PpPrx variants to improve their enzymatic function. The optimal position of the additional Cys residues for the dual functionality was assessed. The peroxidase activities of the S31C and Y192C mutants were increased 3- to 4-fold compared to the wild-type, while the chaperone activity was maintained at > 66% of PpPrx. To investigate whether optimization of the dual functions could enhance stress-tolerance in vivo, a complementation study was performed. The S31C and Y192C mutants showed a much greater tolerance than other variants under a complex condition of heat and oxidative stresses. The optimized dual functions of PpPrx could be adapted for use in bioengineering systems and industries, such as to develop organisms that are more resistant to extreme environments.

Abstract: Summary
Vesicle transport requires four steps: vesicle formation, movement, tethering, and fusion. In yeast, two Rab GTPases, Ypt31/32, are required for post-Golgi vesicle formation. A third Rab GTPase, Sec4, and the exocyst act in tethering and fusion of these vesicles. Vesicle production is coupled to transport via direct interaction between Ypt31/32 and the yeast myosin V, Myo2. Here we show that Myo2 interacts directly with Sec4 and the exocyst subunit Sec15. Disruption of these interactions results in compromised growth and the accumulation of secretory vesicles. We identified the Sec15-binding region on Myo2 and also identified residues on Sec15 required for interaction with Myo2. That Myo2 interacts with Sec15 uncovers additional roles for the exocyst as an adaptor for molecular motors and implies similar roles for structurally related tethering complexes. Moreover, these studies predict that for many pathways, molecular motors attach to vesicles prior to their formation and remain attached until fusion.

Abstract: Summary
The netrins and slits are two families of widely conserved cues that guide axons and cells along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of animals. These cues typically emanate from the dorsal or ventral midlines and provide spatial information to migrating cells by forming gradients along the D-V axis. Some cell types, however, extend processes to both the dorsal and ventral midlines, suggesting the existence of additional guidance cues that are secreted from both midlines. Here, we report that a previously uncharacterized protein called MADD-4 is secreted by the dorsal and ventral nerve cords of the nematode C. elegans to attract sensory axons and muscle membrane extensions called muscle arms. MADD-4's activity is dependent on UNC-40/DCC, a netrin receptor, which functions cell-autonomously to direct membrane extension. The biological role of MADD-4 orthologs, including ADAMTSL1 and 3 in mammals, is unknown. MADD-4 may therefore represent the founding member of a family of guidance proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Homologous chromosome pairing is a prerequisite to establish physical linkage between homologs, which is critical for faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis I. The establishment of pairing is genetically separable from subsequent synapsis, defined as stabilization of pairing by the synaptonemal complex (SC). The underlying mechanism of presynaptic pairing is poorly understood. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a unique cis-acting element, the pairing center (PC), is essential for presynaptic pairing; however, it is not known whether and how the remainder of the chromosome contributes to presynaptic pairing. Here we report direct evidence for presynaptic pairing activity intrinsic to non-PC regions, which is facilitated by a conserved chromodomain protein, MRG-1. In mrg-1 loss-of-function mutants, pairing is compromised specifically in non-PC regions, leading to nonhomologous SC assembly. Our data support a model in which presynaptic alignment in non-PC regions collaborates with initial PC pairing to ensure correct homologous synapsis.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered, noncoding, small regulatory RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression. Although many miRNAs are identified and validated in many plant species, they remain largely unknown in Brassica rapa (AA 2n =, 20). B. rapa is an important Brassica crop with wide genetic and morphological diversity resulting in several subspecies that are largely grown for vegetables, oilseeds, and fodder crop production. In this study, we identified 186 miRNAs belonging to 55 families in B. rapa by using comparative genomics. The lengths of identified mature and pre-miRNAs ranged from 18 to 22 and 66 to 305 nucleotides, respectively. Comparison of 4 nucleotides revealed that uracil is the predominant base in the first position of B. rapa miRNA, suggesting that it plays an important role in miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Overall, adenine and guanine were predominant in mature miRNAs, while adenine and uracil were predominant in pre-miRNA sequences. One DNA sequence producing both sense and antisense mature miRNAs belonging to the BrMiR 399 family, which differs by 1 nucleotide at the, 20th position, was identified. In silicoanalyses, using previously established methods, predicted 66 miRNA target mRNAs for 33 miRNA families. The majority of the target genes were transcription factors that regulate plant growth and development, followed by a few target genes that are involved in fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, biotic and abiotic stresses, and other cellular processes. Northern blot and qRT-PCR analyses of RNA samples prepared from different B. rapa tissues for 17 miRNA families revealed that miRNAs are differentially expressed both quantitatively and qualitatively in different tissues of B. rapa.

Abstract: Summary
Orexin (OX) neuropeptides stimulate feeding and arousal. Deficiency of orexin is implicated in narcolepsy, a disease associated with obesity, paradoxically in the face of reduced food intake. Here, we show that obesity in orexin-null mice is associated with impaired brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Failure of thermogenesis in OX-null mice is due to inability of brown preadipocytes to differentiate. The differentiation defect in OX-null neonates is circumvented by OX injections to OX-null dams. In vitro, OX, triggers the full differentiation program in mesenchymal progenitor stem cells, embryonic fibroblasts and brown preadipocytes via p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase and bone morphogenetic protein receptor-1a (BMPR1A)-dependent Smad1/5 signaling. Our study suggests that obesity associated with OX depletion is linked to brown-fat hypoactivity, which leads to dampening of energy expenditure. Thus, orexin plays an integral role in adaptive thermogenesis and body weight regulation via effects on BAT differentiation and function.

Abstract: Summary
In proliferating cells, a transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism is known as the Warburg effect, whose reversal inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Studying its regulator pyruvate kinase (PYK) in yeast, we discovered that central metabolism is self-adapting to synchronize redox metabolism when respiration is activated. Low PYK activity activated yeast respiration. However, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) did not increase, and cells gained resistance to oxidants. This adaptation was attributable to accumulation of the PYK substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). PEP acted as feedback inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). TPI inhibition stimulated the pentose phosphate pathway, increased antioxidative metabolism, and prevented ROS accumulation. Thus, a metabolic feedback loop, initiated by PYK, mediated by its substrate and acting on TPI, stimulates redox metabolism in respiring cells. Originating from a single catalytic step, this autonomous reconfiguration of central carbon metabolism prevents oxidative stress upon shifts between fermentation and respiration.

Abstract: Summary
Hereditary breast cancers are frequently caused by germline BRCA1 mutations. The BRCA1C61G mutation in the BRCA1 RING domain is a common pathogenic missense variant, which reduces BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimerization and abrogates its ubiquitin ligase activity. To investigate the role of BRCA1 RING function in tumor suppression and therapy response, we introduced the Brca1C61G mutation in a conditional mouse model for BRCA1-associated breast cancer. In contrast to BRCA1-deficient mammary carcinomas, tumors carrying the Brca1C61G mutation responded poorly to platinum drugs and PARP inhibition and rapidly developed resistance while retaining the Brca1C61G mutation. These findings point to hypomorphic activity of the BRCA1-C61G protein that, although unable to prevent tumor development, affects response to therapy.

Abstract: The present investigation reports the effect of rosmarinic acid (RA), an antioxidant on gentamicin sulphate (GS)-induced renal oxidative damage in rats. Rosmarinic acid (RA) has been demonstrated to have antioxidant, free radical scavenger and anti-inflamatory effects. Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in to four equal groups as follows: group 1 (control), group 2 (GS 100mg/kg/d ip), group 3 (GS 100mg/kg/d ip+RA 50mg/kg/d) and group 4 (GS 100mg/kg/d ip+RA 100mg/kg/d). Treatments were administrated once daily for 12 days. After 12 days 24h urine was collected, blood was sampled and kidneys were removed. Serum and kidney tissue MDA assessed by thiobarbituric acid. Kidney paraffin sections (5μm thickness) from the left kidney stained with periodic acid Schiff. Tubular necrosis was studied semiquantitatively and glomerular volume and volume density of proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) estimated stereologically. Kidney homogenize were prepared from right kidney. Serum creatinine, urea and kidney antioxidant enzymes activity were assessed by special kits. Data were compared by SPSS 13 software and Mann–Whitney test at p<0.05. Co treatment of GS and RA (High dose) significantly decreased serum creatinine, MDA, urea, tubular necrosis (p<0.05) and increase renal GSH, GPX, CAT, SOD, volume density of PCT and creatinine clearance significantly in comparison with GS group (p<0.05). Treatment with RA (high dose) maintained serum creatinine, volume density of PCT, renal GSH, GPX, SOD and MDA as the same level as control group significantly (p<0.05). In conclusion, RA alleviates GS nephrotoxicity via antioxidant activity, increase of renal GSH content and increase of renal antioxidant enzymes activity.

Abstract: Neuronal Ca2+ dyshomeostasis associated with cognitive impairment and mediated by changes in several Ca2+ sources has been seen in animal models of both aging and diabetes. In the periphery, dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ signals may contribute to the development of insulin resistance. In the brain, while it is well-established that type 2 diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for the development of dementia in the elderly, it is not clear whether Ca2+ dysregulation might also affect insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization. Here we present a combination of imaging techniques testing the disappearance of the fluorescent glucose analog 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) as an indication of glycolytic activity in neurons and astrocytes. Our work shows that glucose utilization at rest is greater in neurons compared to astrocytes, and ceases upon activation in neurons with little change in astrocytes. Pretreatment of hippocampal cultures with pioglitazone, a drug used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, significantly reduced glycolytic activity in neurons and enhanced it in astrocytes. This series of experiments, including Fura-2 and NADH imaging, provides results that are consistent with the idea that Ca2+ levels may rapidly alter glycolytic activity, and that downstream events beyond Ca2+ dysregulation with aging, may alter cellular metabolism in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Despite its prevalence, the molecular basis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the developmental transcription factor Grhl3 as a potent tumor suppressor of SCC in mice, and demonstrate that targeting of Grhl3 by a miR-21-dependent proto-oncogenic network underpins SCC in humans. Deletion of Grhl3 in adult epidermis evokes loss of expression of PTEN, a direct GRHL3 target, resulting in aggressive SCC induced by activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. Restoration of Pten expression completely abrogates SCC formation. Reduced levels of GRHL3 and PTEN are evident in human skin, and head and neck SCC, associated with increased expression of miR-21, which targets both tumor suppressors. Our data define the GRHL3-PTEN axis as a critical tumor suppressor pathway in SCC.

Abstract: Summary
Plant cells are connected through plasmodesmata (PD), membrane-lined channels that allow symplastic movement of molecules between cells. However, little is known about the role of PD-mediated signaling during plant morphogenesis. Here, we describe an Arabidopsis gene, CALS3/GSL12. Gain-of-function mutations in CALS3 result in increased accumulation of callose (β-1,3-glucan) at the PD, a decrease in PD aperture, defects in root development, and reduced intercellular trafficking. Enhancement of CALS3 expression during phloem development suppressed loss-of-function mutations in the phloem abundant callose synthase, CALS7 indicating that CALS3 is a bona fide callose synthase. CALS3 alleles allowed us to spatially and temporally control the PD aperture between plant tissues. Using this tool, we are able to show that movement of the transcription factor SHORT-ROOT and microRNA165 between the stele and the endodermis is PD dependent. Taken together, we conclude that regulated callose biosynthesis at PD is essential for cell signaling.

A Muscle-Specific p38 MAPK/Mef2/MnSOD Pathway Regulates Stress, Motor Function, and Life Span in Drosophila,

Abstract: Summary
Molecular mechanisms that concordantly regulate stress, life span, and aging remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that in Drosophila, a p38 MAP kinase (p38K)/Mef2/MnSOD pathway is a coregulator of stress and life span. Hence, overexpression of p38K extends life span in a MnSOD-dependent manner, whereas inhibition of p38K causes early lethality and precipitates age-related motor dysfunction and stress sensitivity, that is rescued through muscle-restricted (but not neuronal) add-back of p38K. Additionally, mutations in p38K are associated with increased protein carbonylation and Nrf2-dependent transcription, while adversely affecting metabolic response to hypoxia. Mechanistically, p38K modulates expression of the mitochondrial MnSOD enzyme through the transcription factor Mef2, and predictably, perturbations in MnSOD modify p38K-dependent phenotypes. Thus, our results uncover a muscle-restricted p38K-Mef2-MnSOD signaling module that influences life span and stress, distinct from the insulin/JNK/FOXO pathway. We propose that potentiating p38K might be instrumental in restoring the mitochondrial detoxification machinery and combating stress-induced aging.

Abstract: The antifungal efficacy of Ficus sycomorus and Pergularia tomentosa plant extracts on Bufo regularis experimentally infected with Aspergillus niger was studied. After an oral administration of the pathogen for 15 days, the blood, kidney and liver were examined. Treatment with A. niger produced a reduction in red blood count cells and hemoglobin content. Also, both livers and kidneys revealed marked destruction and degenerative changes. These changes included congestion of blood vessels, leukocytic infiltration, and cytoplasmic vacuolization of the hepatocytes. As well as complete destruction of the cellular boundaries of the tubular epithelia, inflammatory leukocytes between the intertubular spaces, destruction and necrosis in renal tubule cells and the swollen glomeruli with wide glomerular spaces were seen. Pretreatment with F. sycomorus and P. tomentosa plant extracts 1h prior the administration of A. niger for two weeks improved blood parameters and protected against hepatic and renal damage as observed from histological examination and reduced spore numbers in culture media on these organs.

Abstract: Summary
In vertebrates, unfertilized eggs are arrested at metaphase of meiosis II by Mos and Emi2, an inhibitor of the APC/C ubiquitin ligase. In Xenopus, Cdk1 phosphorylates Emi2 and both destabilizes and inactivates it, whereas Mos recruits PP2A phosphatase to antagonize the Cdk1 phosphorylation. However, how Cdk1 phosphorylation inhibits Emi2 is largely unknown. Here we show that multiple N-terminal Cdk1 phosphorylation motifs bind cyclin B1-Cdk1 itself, Plk1, and CK1δ/ε to inhibit Emi2. Plk1, after rebinding to other sites by self-priming phosphorylation, partially destabilizes Emi2. Cdk1 and CK1δ/ε sequentially phosphorylate the C-terminal APC/C-docking site, thereby cooperatively inhibiting Emi2 from binding the APC/C. In the presence of Mos, however, PP2A-B56β/ε bind to Emi2 and keep dephosphorylating it, particularly at the APC/C-docking site. Thus, Emi2 stability and activity are dynamically regulated by Emi2-bound multiple kinases and PP2A phosphatase. Our data also suggest a general role for Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation motifs in M phase regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The functional significance of the signaling pathway induced by O6-methylguanine (O6-MeG) lesions is poorly understood. Here, we identify the p50 subunit of NF-κB as a central target in the response to O6-MeG and demonstrate that p50 is required for SN1-methylator-induced cytotoxicity. In response to SN1-methylation, p50 facilitates the inhibition of NF-κB-regulated antiapoptotic gene expression. Inhibition of NF-κB activity is noted to be an S phase-specific phenomenon that requires the formation of O6-MeG:T mismatches. Chk1 associates with p50 following SN1-methylation, and phosphorylation of p50 by Chk1 results in the inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding. Expression of an unphosphorylatable p50 mutant blocks inhibition of NF-κB-regulated antiapoptotic gene expression and attenuates SN1-methylator-induced cytotoxicity. While O6-MeG:T-induced, p50-dependent signaling is not sufficient to induce cell death, this pathway sensitizes cells to the cytotoxic effects of DNA breaks.

Abstract: Xenopus laevis oocytes are commonly used to study the biophysical and pharmacological properties of foreign ion channels and receptors, but little is known about those endogenously expressed in their enveloping layer of follicular cells (FCs). Whole-cell recordings and the perforated patch-clamp technique in cultured FCs held at -60 mV revealed that ATP (20-250 μM) generates inward currents of 465 ± 93 pA (mean ± standard error) in ~60% of the FCs studied, whereas outward currents of 317 ± 100 pA were found in ~5% of the cells. The net effect of ATP on the FCs was to activate both mono- and biphasic inward currents, with an associated increase in membrane chloride conductance. Two-microelectrode voltage-clamp recordings of nude oocytes held at -60 mV disclosed that ATP elicited biphasic inward currents, corresponding to the well-known F¡„ and Sin-like currents. ATP receptor antagonists like suramin, TNP-ATP, and RB2 did not inhibit any of these responses. On the other hand, when using wholecell recordings, 1 μM Ang II yielded smooth inward currents of 157 ± 45 pA in ~16% of the FC held at -60 mV. The net Ang II response, mediated by the activation of the ATi receptor, was a chloride current inhibited by 10 nM ZD7155. This study will help to better understand the roles of ATP and Ang II receptors in the physiology of X. laevis oocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophil homeostasis is essential for host defense. Here we identify dual roles for Rac2 during neutrophil homeostasis using a zebrafish model of primary immune deficiency induced by the human inhibitory Rac2D57N mutation in neutrophils. Noninvasive live imaging of Rac2 morphants or Rac2D57N zebrafish larvae demonstrates an essential role for Rac2 in regulating 3D motility and the polarization of F-actin dynamics and PI(3)K signaling in vivo. Tracking of photolabeled Rac2-deficient neutrophils from hematopoietic tissue also shows increased mobilization into the circulation, indicating that neutrophil mobilization does not require traditionally defined cell motility. Moreover, excessive neutrophil retention in hematopoietic tissue resulting from a constitutively active CXCR4 mutation in zebrafish warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome is partially rescued by the inhibitory Rac2 mutation. These findings reveal that Rac2 signaling is necessary for both neutrophil 3D motility and CXCR4-mediated neutrophil retention in hematopoietic tissue, thereby limiting neutrophil mobilization, a critical first step in the innate immune response.

Abstract: Summary
Morphogenesis of mammalian facial processes requires coordination of cellular proliferation, migration, and apoptosis to develop intricate features. Cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P), the most frequent human craniofacial birth defect, can be caused by perturbation of any of these programs. Mutations of WNT, P63, and IRF6 yield CL/P in humans and mice; however, how these genes are regulated remains elusive. We generated mouse lines lacking Pbx genes in cephalic ectoderm and demonstrated that they exhibit fully penetrant CL/P and perturbed Wnt signaling. We also characterized a midfacial regulatory element that Pbx proteins bind to control the expression of Wnt9b-Wnt3, which in turn regulates p63. Altogether, we establish a Pbx-dependent Wnt-p63-Irf6 regulatory module in midfacial ectoderm that is conserved within mammals. Dysregulation of this network leads to localized suppression of midfacial apoptosis and CL/P. Ectopic Wnt ectodermal expression in Pbx mutants rescues the clefting, opening avenues for tissue repair.

Abstract: Summary
A genomic signature designed to assess the activity of the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) was used to profile more than 800 breast tumors, revealing a shorter disease-free survival in patients with tumors exhibiting elevated receptor activity. Importantly, this signature also predicted the ability of an ERRα antagonist, XCT790, to inhibit proliferation in cellular models of breast cancer. Using a chemical genomic approach, it was determined that activation of the Her2/IGF-1R signaling pathways and subsequent C-MYC stabilization upregulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 beta (PGC-1β), an obligate cofactor for ERRα activity. PGC-1β knockdown in breast cancer cells impaired ERRα signaling and reduced cell proliferation, implicating a functional role for PGC-1β/ERRα in the pathogenesis of breast cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Being sessile organisms, plants need rapid and finely tuned signaling pathways to adapt their growth and survival over their immediate and often adverse environment. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone crucial for both biotic and abiotic stress responses. In this study, we highlight a function of six Arabidopsis MATH-BTB proteins in ABA signaling. MATH-BTB proteins act as substrate-binding adaptors for the Cullin3-based ubiquitin E3 ligase. Our genetic and biochemical experiments demonstrate that the MATH-BTB proteins directly interact with and target for proteasomal degradation the class I homeobox-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) transcription factor ATHB6, which was previously identified as a negative regulator of ABA responses. Reducing CUL3BPM function leads to higher ATHB6 protein accumulation, reducing plant growth and fertility, and affects stomatal behavior and responses to ABA. We further demonstrate that ABA negatively regulates ATHB6 protein turnover, a situation reminiscent to ABI5, another transcription factor involved in ABA signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy, a major degradation process for long-lived and aggregate-prone proteins, affects various human processes, such as development, immunity, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Several autophagy regulators have been identified in recent years. Here we show that nitric oxide (NO), a potent cellular messenger, inhibits autophagosome synthesis via a number of mechanisms. NO impairs autophagy by inhibiting the activity of S-nitrosylation substrates, JNK1 and IKKβ. Inhibition of JNK1 by NO reduces Bcl-2 phosphorylation and increases the Bcl-2–Beclin 1 interaction, thereby disrupting hVps34/Beclin 1 complex formation. Additionally, NO inhibits IKKβ and reduces AMPK phosphorylation, leading to mTORC1 activation via TSC2. Overexpression of nNOS, iNOS, or eNOS impairs autophagosome formation primarily via the JNK1–Bcl-2 pathway. Conversely, NOS inhibition enhances the clearance of autophagic substrates and reduces neurodegeneration in models of Huntington's disease. Our data suggest that nitrosative stress-mediated protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases may be, in part, due to autophagy inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA exosome is a conserved degradation machinery, which obtains full activity only when associated with cofactors. The most prominent activator of the yeast nuclear exosome is the RNA helicase Mtr4p, acting in the context of the Trf4p/Air2p/Mtr4p polyadenylation (TRAMP) complex. The existence of a similar activator(s) in humans remains elusive. By establishing an interaction network of the human nuclear exosome, we identify the trimeric Nuclear Exosome Targeting (NEXT) complex, containing hMTR4, the Zn-knuckle protein ZCCHC8, and the putative RNA binding protein RBM7. ZCCHC8 and RBM7 are excluded from nucleoli, and consistently NEXT is specifically required for the exosomal degradation of promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs). We also detect putative homolog TRAMP subunits hTRF4-2 (Trf4p) and ZCCHC7 (Air2p) in hRRP6 and hMTR4 precipitates. However, at least ZCCHC7 function is restricted to nucleoli. Our results suggest that human nuclear exosome degradation pathways comprise modules of spatially organized cofactors that diverge from the yeast model.

Abstract: Summary
We have developed genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), which manifest a large change in fluorescence upon NADH binding. We demonstrate the utility of these sensors in mammalian cells by monitoring the dynamic changes in NADH levels in subcellular organelles as affected by NADH transport, glucose metabolism, electron transport chain function, and redox environment, and we demonstrate the temporal separation of changes in mitochondrial and cytosolic NADH levels with perturbation. These results support the view that cytosolic NADH is sensitive to environmental changes, while mitochondria have a strong tendency to maintain physiological NADH homeostasis. These sensors provide a very good alternative to existing techniques that measure endogenous fluorescence of intracellular NAD(P)H and, owing to their superior sensitivity and specificity, allow for the selective monitoring of total cellular and compartmental responses of this essential cofactor.

Abstract: Summary
Fasting-induced suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis is an adaptive response to decrease energy expenditure during food deprivation. Previous studies demonstrate that leptin communicates nutritional status to the HPT axis through thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Leptin targets TRH neurons either directly or indirectly via the arcuate nucleus through pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide/neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY) neurons. To evaluate the role of these pathways in vivo, we developed double knockout mice that lack both the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and NPY. We show that NPY is required for fasting-induced suppression of Trh expression in the PVN. However, both MC4R and NPY are required for activation of hepatic pathways that metabolize T4 during the fasting response. Thus, these signaling pathways play a key role in the communication of fasting signals to reduce thyroid hormone levels both centrally and through a peripheral hepatic circuit.

Abstract: Summary
The Ewing sarcoma (EWS) protein is a member of the TET (TLS/EWS/TAF15) family of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins whose expression is altered in cancer. We report that EWS depletion results in alternative splicing changes of genes involved in DNA repair and genotoxic stress signaling, including ABL1, CHEK2, and MAP4K2. Chromatin and RNA crosslinking immunoprecipitation results indicate that EWS cotranscriptionally binds to its target RNAs. This association is reduced upon irradiation of cells with ultraviolet light, concomitant with transient enrichment of EWS in nucleoli and with alternative splicing changes that parallel those induced by EWS depletion and that lead to reduced c-ABL protein expression. Consistent with the functional relevance of EWS-mediated alternative splicing regulation in DNA damage response, EWS depletion reduces cell viability and proliferation upon UV irradiation, effects that are attenuated by restoring c-ABL expression. These results provide insights into posttranscriptional mechanisms of DNA damage response by a TET protein.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cells have an altered metabolic phenotype characterized by increased glycolysis and diminished oxidative phosphorylation. Despite the suspected importance of glycolysis in tumorigenesis, the temporal relationship between oncogene signaling, in vivo tumor formation, and glycolytic pathway activity is poorly understood. Moreover, how glycolytic pathways are altered as tumors regress remains unknown. Here, we use a switchable model of Myc-driven liver cancer, along with hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to visualize glycolysis in de novo tumor formation and regression. LDHA abundance and activity in tumors is tightly correlated to in vivo pyruvate conversion to lactate and is rapidly inhibited as tumors begin to regress, as are numerous glycolysis pathway genes. Conversion of pyruvate to alanine predominates in precancerous tissues prior to observable morphologic or histological changes. These results demonstrate that metabolic changes precede tumor formation and regression and are directly linked to the activity of a single oncogene.

Abstract: Cell synchrony is a critical requirement for the study of eukaryotic cells. Although several chemical and genetic methods of cell cycle synchronization are currently available, they have certain limitations, such as unnecessary perturbations to cells. We developed a novel cell cycle synchronization method that is based on a cell chip platform. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a simple but useful model system to study cell biology and shares many similar features with higher eukaryotic cells. Single yeast cells were individually captured in the wells of a specially designed cell chip platform. When released from the cell chip, the yeast cells were synchronized, with all cells in the G1 phase. This method is non-invasive and causes minimal chemical and biological damage to cells. The capture and release of cells using cells chips with microwells of specific dimensions allows for the isolation of cells of a particular size and shape; this enables the isolation of cells of a given phase, because the size and shape of yeast cells vary with the phase of the cell cycle. To test the viability of synchronized cells, the yeast cells captured in the cell chip platform were assessed for response to mating pheromone (α-factor). The synchronized cells isolated using the cell chip were capable of mediating the mating signaling response and exhibited a dynamic and robust response behavior. By changing the dimensions of the well of the cell chip, cells of other cell cycle phases can also be isolated.

Abstract: Summary
Cell migration during wound healing requires adhesion receptor turnover to enable the formation and disassembly of cell-extracellular matrix contacts. Although recent advances have improved our understanding of integrin trafficking pathways, it is not known how extracellular ligand engagement controls receptor dynamics. Using atomic force microscopy, we have measured cell avidity for fibronectin and defined a mechanism for the outside-in regulation of α5β1-integrin. Surprisingly, adhesive strength was attenuated by the syndecan-4-binding domain of fibronectin due to a rapid triggering of α5β1-integrin endocytosis. Association of syndecan-4 with PKCα was found to trigger RhoG activation and subsequent dynamin- and caveolin-dependent integrin uptake. Like disruption of syndecan-4 or caveolin, gene disruption of RhoG in mice was found to retard closure of dermal wounds due to a migration defect of the fibroblasts and keratinocytes of RhoG null mice. Thus, this syndecan-4-regulated integrin endocytic pathway appears to play a key role in tissue repair.

Abstract: Summary
Metaphase chromosome positioning depends on Kif18A, a kinesin-8 that accumulates at and suppresses the dynamics of K-MT plus ends. By engineering Kif18A mutants that suppress MT dynamics but fail to concentrate at K-MT plus ends, we identify a mechanism that allows Kif18A to accumulate at K-MT plus ends to a level required to suppress chromosome movements. Enrichment of Kif18A at K-MT plus ends depends on its C-terminal tail domain, while the ability of Kif18A to suppress MT growth is conferred by the N-terminal motor domain. The Kif18A tail contains a second MT-binding domain that diffuses along the MT lattice, suggesting that it tethers the motor to the MT track. Consistently, the tail enhances Kif18A processivity and is crucial for it to accumulate at K-MT plus ends. The heightened processivity of Kif18A, conferred by its tail domain, thus promotes concentration of Kif18A at K-MT plus ends, where it suppresses their dynamics to control chromosome movements.

Abstract: Summary
The activities of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are negatively regulated by their endogenous inhibitor, DEPTOR. As such, the abundance of DEPTOR is a critical determinant in the activity status of the mTOR network. DEPTOR stability is governed by the 26S-proteasome through a largely unknown mechanism. Here we describe an mTOR-dependent phosphorylation-driven pathway for DEPTOR destruction via SCFβTrCP. DEPTOR phosphorylation by mTOR in response to growth signals, and in collaboration with casein kinase I (CKI), generates a phosphodegron that binds βTrCP. Failure to degrade DEPTOR through either degron mutation or βTrCP depletion leads to reduced mTOR activity, reduced S6 kinase activity, and activation of autophagy to reduce cell growth. This work expands the current understanding of mTOR regulation by revealing a positive feedback loop involving mTOR and CKI-dependent turnover of its inhibitor, DEPTOR, suggesting that misregulation of the DEPTOR destruction pathway might contribute to aberrant activation of mTOR in disease.

Abstract: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells in a glucose-dependent manner. However, factors other than glucose that regulate the β-cell response to GLP-1 remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the possible involvement of insulin and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in regulation of the GLP-1 responsiveness of β-cells. Pretreatment of β-cells with HNMPA, an insulin receptor inhibitor, and AG1478, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, further increased the cAMP level and Erk phosphorylation in the presence of exendin-4 (exe-4), a GLP-1 agonist. When β-cells were exposed to a high concentration of glucose (25 mM), which stimulates insulin secretion, exe-4-induced cAMP formation declined gradually as exposure time was increased. This decreased cAMP formation was not observed in the presence of HNMPA. HNMPA was able to further increase the exe-4-induced insulin secretion when β-cells were exposed to high glucose for 18 h. Treatment of β-cells with insulin significantly decreased exe-4-induced cAMP formation in a dose-dependent manner. Lowering the phospho-Akt level by HNMPA or LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, further augmented exe-4-induced cAMP formation and Erk phosphorylation. These results suggest that insulin contributes to fine-tuning of the β-cell response to GLP-1.

Abstract: Summary
In all organisms, RNA polymerase (RNAP) relies on accessory factors to complete synthesis of long RNAs. These factors increase RNAP processivity by reducing pausing and termination, but their molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We identify the β gate loop as an RNAP element required for antipausing activity of a bacterial virulence factor RfaH, a member of the universally conserved NusG family. Interactions with the gate loop are necessary for suppression of pausing and termination by RfaH, but are dispensable for RfaH binding to RNAP mediated by the β′ clamp helices. We hypothesize that upon binding to the clamp helices and the gate loop RfaH bridges the gap across the DNA channel, stabilizing RNAP contacts with nucleic acid and disfavoring isomerization into a paused state. We show that contacts with the gate loop are also required for antipausing by NusG and propose that most NusG homologs use similar mechanisms to increase RNAP processivity.

Here we show how the 64 kDa C-terminal region of USP7 can positively regulate deubiquitinating activity. We present the crystal structure of this USP7/HAUSP ubiquitin-like domain (HUBL) comprised of five ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domains organized in 2-1-2 Ubl units. The last di-Ubl unit, HUBL-45, is sufficient to activate USP7, through binding to a “switching” loop in the catalytic domain, which promotes ubiquitin binding and increases activity 100-fold. This activation can be enhanced allosterically by the metabolic enzyme GMPS. It binds to the first three Ubl domains (HUBL-123) and hyperactivates USP7 by stabilization of the HUBL-45-dependent active state.

Abstract: Summary
We show constitutive activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) in cells bearing oncogenic forms of KIT, FLT3, and BCR-ABL, which is dependent on PI3K and Rho GTPase. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of ROCK in oncogene-bearing cells impaired their growth as well as the growth of acute myeloid leukemia patient-derived blasts and prolonged the life span of mice bearing myeloproliferative disease. Downstream from ROCK, rapid dephosphorylation or loss of expression of myosin light chain resulted in enhanced apoptosis, reduced growth, and loss of actin polymerization in oncogene-bearing cells leading to significantly prolonged life span of leukemic mice. In summary we describe a pathway involving PI3K/Rho/ROCK/MLC that may contribute to myeloproliferative disease and/or acute myeloid leukemia in humans.

Abstract: The inner ear converts sound waves into hearing signals through the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) process. Deflection of the stereocilia bundle of hair cells causes the opening of channels that allow the entry of endolymph K+ and Ca2+. Ca2+ that enters is crucial to the hearing process and is exported to the endolymph by the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (isoform PMCA2w/a): disturbances of the balance between Ca2+ penetration and ejection, e.g. by pump mutations, generate deafness. Hearing loss caused by PMCA defects is frequently exacerbated by mutations in cadherin 23, a single pass stereociliar Ca2+ binding protein that forms the tip links which permit the deflection of the stereocilia bundle and thus the opening of the MET channels. The PMCA2w/a pump ejects Ca2+ to the endolymph even in the absence of the natural activator calmodulin. This satisfies the special Ca2+ homeostasis requirements of the stereocilia/endolymph system. Here we have analyzed a mice and a human previously described pump mutant. The human mutant only exacerbated the deafness produced by a cadherin 23 mutation. The murine mutant overexpressed in model cells displayed an evident defect both in the basal activity of the pump and in the long range ejection of Ca2+, the human mutant instead failed to impair the Ca2+ ejection by the pump.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, the Sirtuins are composed of seven Sir2 orthologs (Sirt1–7) with a conserved deacetylase core that utilizes NAD+ as a cofactor. Interestingly, the deacetylase core of Sirt1 by itself has no catalytic activity. We found within the C-terminal domain a 25 aa sequence that is essential for Sirt1 activity (ESA). Our results indicate that the ESA region interacts with and functions as an “on switch” for the deacetylase core. The endogenous Sirt1 inhibitor DBC1, which also binds to the deacetylase core, competes with and inhibits the ESA region from interacting with the deacetylase core. We discovered an ESA mutant peptide that can bind to the deacetylase core and inhibit Sirt1 in trans. By using this mutant peptide, we were able to inhibit Sirt1 activity and to increase the chemosensitivity of androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells. Therefore, the ESA region is a potential target for development of therapies to regulate Sirt1.

Abstract: Summary
The renal thick ascending limb (TAL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT) play central roles in salt homeostasis and blood pressure regulation. An emerging model suggests that bumetanide- and thiazide-sensitive NaCl transporters (NKCC2 and NCC) along these segments are phosphorylated and activated by WNK kinases, via SPAK and OSR1. Here, we show that a kidney-specific SPAK isoform, which lacks the kinase domain, inhibits phosphorylation of NCC and NKCC2 by full-length SPAK in vitro. Kidney-specific SPAK is highly expressed along the TAL, whereas full-length SPAK is more highly expressed along the DCT. As predicted from the differential expression, SPAK knockout in animals has divergent effects along TAL and DCT, with increased phosphorylated NKCC2 along TAL and decreased phosphorylated NCC along DCT. In mice, extracellular fluid volume depletion shifts SPAK isoform abundance to favor NaCl retention along both segments, indicating that a SPAK isoform switch modulates sodium avidity along the distal nephron.

Abstract: Summary
p53 is the central regulator of cell fate following genotoxic stress and oncogene activation. Its activity is controlled by several posttranslational modifications. Originally defined as a critical layer of p53 regulation in human cell lines, p53 lysine methylation by Set7/9 (also called Setd7) was proposed to fulfill a similar function in vivo in the mouse, promoting p53 acetylation, stabilization, and activation upon DNA damage (Kurash et al., 2008). We tested the physiological relevance of this circuit in an independent Set7/9 knockout mouse strain. Deletion of Set7/9 had no effect on p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis following sublethal or lethal DNA damage induced by radiation or genotoxic agents. Set7/9 was also dispensable for p53 acetylation following irradiation. c-myc oncogene-induced apoptosis was also independent of Set7/9, and analysis of p53 target genes showed that Set7/9 is not required for the p53-dependent gene expression program. Our data indicate that Set7/9 is dispensable for p53 function in the mouse.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila neural stem cells, larval brain neuroblasts (NBs), align their mitotic spindles along the apical/basal axis during asymmetric cell division (ACD) to maintain the balance of self-renewal and differentiation. Here, we identified a protein complex composed of the tumor suppressor anastral spindle 2 (Ana2), a dynein light-chain protein Cut up (Ctp), and Mushroom body defect (Mud), which regulates mitotic spindle orientation. We isolated two ana2 alleles that displayed spindle misorientation and NB overgrowth phenotypes in larval brains. The centriolar protein Ana2 anchors Ctp to centrioles during ACD. The centriolar localization of Ctp is important for spindle orientation. Ana2 and Ctp localize Mud to the centrosomes and cell cortex and facilitate/maintain the association of Mud with Pins at the apical cortex. Our findings reveal that the centrosomal proteins Ana2 and Ctp regulate Mud function to orient the mitotic spindle during NB asymmetric division.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant melanoma is characterized by frequent metastasis, however, specific changes that regulate this process have not been clearly delineated. Although it is well known that Wnt signaling is frequently dysregulated in melanoma, the functional implications of this observation are unclear. By modulating β-catenin levels in a mouse model of melanoma that is based on melanocyte-specific Pten loss and BrafV600E mutation, we demonstrate that β-catenin is a central mediator of melanoma metastasis to the lymph nodes and lungs. In addition to altering metastasis, β-catenin levels control tumor differentiation and regulate both MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt signaling. Highly metastatic tumors with β-catenin stabilization are very similar to a subset of human melanomas. Together these findings establish Wnt signaling as a metastasis regulator in melanoma.

Abstract: Floral transition is coordinately regulated by both endogenous and exogenous cues to ensure reproductive success under fluctuating environmental conditions. Abiotic stress conditions, including drought and high salinity, also have considerable influence on this developmental process. However, the signaling components and molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of floral transition by environmental factors have not yet been defined. In this work, we show that the Arabidopsis BROTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (BFT) gene, which encodes a member of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)/TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) family, regulates floral transition under conditions of high salinity. The BFT gene was transcriptionally induced by high salinity in an abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent manner. Transgenic plants overexpressing the BFT gene (35S:BFT) and BFT-deficient mutant (bft-2) plants were phenotypically indistinguishable from Col-0 plants in seed germination and seedling growth under high salinity. In contrast, although the floral transition was delayed significantly in Col-0 plants under high salinity, that of the bft-2 mutant was not affected by high salinity. We also observed that expression of the APETALA1 (AP1) gene was suppressed to a lesser degree in the bft-2 mutant than in Col-0 plants. Taken together, our observations suggest that BFT mediates salt stress-responsive flowering, providing an adaptive strategy that ensures reproductive success under unfavorable stress conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to specify and maintain discrete cell fates is essential for development. However, the dynamics underlying selection and stability of distinct cell types remain poorly understood. Here, we provide a quantitative single-cell analysis of commitment dynamics during the mating-mitosis switch in budding yeast. Commitment to division corresponds precisely to activating the G1 cyclin positive feedback loop in competition with the cyclin inhibitor Far1. Cyclin-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of the mating pathway scaffold Ste5 are required to ensure exclusive expression of the mitotic transcriptional program after cell cycle commitment. Failure to commit exclusively results in coexpression of both cell cycle and pheromone-induced genes, and a morphologically mixed inviable cell fate. Thus, specification and maintenance of a cellular state are performed by distinct interactions, which are likely a consequence of disparate reaction rates and may be a general feature of the interlinked regulatory networks responsible for selecting cell fates.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic modifications are thought to be important for gene expression changes during development and aging. However, besides the Sir2 histone deacetylase in somatic tissues and H3K4 trimethylation in germlines, there is scant evidence implicating epigenetic regulations in aging. The insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway is a major life span regulatory pathway. Here, we show that progressive increases in gene expression and loss of H3K27me3 on IIS components are due, at least in part, to increased activity of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1 during aging. RNAi of the utx-1 gene extended the mean life span of C. elegans by ∼30%, dependent on DAF-16 activity and not additive in daf-2 mutants. The loss of utx-1 increased H3K27me3 on the Igf1r/daf-2 gene and decreased IIS activity, leading to a more “naive” epigenetic state. Like stem cell reprogramming, our results suggest that reestablishment of epigenetic marks lost during aging might help “reset” the developmental age of animal cells.

Abstract: It has been revealed that skeletal muscle cells have the potential to generate, sense and respond to biomechanical signals and that, mechanical force is one of the important factors influencing proliferation, differentiation, regeneration and homeostasis of skeletal muscle cells and myoblasts. The aim of this study was to illustrate the effect of cyclic uniaxial strain on myogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). This study was designed to investigate this effect within 3 days in 4 groups: control (untreated), chemical, chemical-mechanical and mechanical based on exposure of ASCs to chemical growth factors for 3 days or to mechanical strain just on the 2nd day. Finally, cell orientation, muscle-related gene expression, myosin protein synthesis and the number of myosin-positive cells were examined to estimate the rate of differentiation. By studying the cells before and after exposure to uniaxial strain, it could be observed that by exerting the load, the cells were organized almost perpendicularly to strain direction. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that uniaxial strain had a significant effect on up-regulation of muscle-related genes in chemical–mechanical group (P<0.001) as compared to mechanical or chemical groups. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the myosin-positive cells in treated groups and the numbers of these cells were enumerated by flow cytometry. These data suggest that uniaxial cyclic strain could affect ASCs and cause their myogenic differentiation and that the combination of chemical myogenic differentiation factors with mechanical signals promotes differentiation much more than differentiation by chemical myogenic differentiation factors or mechanical signals alone.

Abstract: Summary
In Caulobacter crescentus, phosphorylation of key regulators is coordinated with the second messenger cyclic di-GMP to drive cell-cycle progression and differentiation. The diguanylate cyclase PleD directs pole morphogenesis, while the c-di-GMP effector PopA initiates degradation of the replication inhibitor CtrA by the AAA+ protease ClpXP to license S phase entry. Here, we establish a direct link between PleD and PopA reliant on the phosphodiesterase PdeA and the diguanylate cyclase DgcB. PdeA antagonizes DgcB activity until the G1-S transition, when PdeA is degraded by the ClpXP protease. The unopposed DgcB activity, together with PleD activation, upshifts c-di-GMP to drive PopA-dependent CtrA degradation and S phase entry. PdeA degradation requires CpdR, a response regulator that delivers PdeA to the ClpXP protease in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thus, CpdR serves as a crucial link between phosphorylation pathways and c-di-GMP metabolism to mediate protein degradation events that irreversibly and coordinately drive bacterial cell-cycle progression and development.

Abstract: We have previously shown that P2X7 receptor blockade prevents ATP excitotoxicity in oligodendrocytes and ameliorates chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Here, we have explored the putative association of functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms of the P2X7 receptor gene with multiple sclerosis. We found that T allele of rs17525809 polymorphism, which yields an Ala-76 to Val change in the extracellular domain, is more frequent in multiple sclerosis patients than in controls. Importantly, P2X7 variants with Val show a gain-of-function consisting in higher calcium permeability, larger electrophysiological responses and higher ethidium uptake, and enhance the effect of the also gain-of-function His-155 to Tyr substitution (rs208294) in the haplotype formed by these two variants. These findings may contribute to define the genetic background predisposing for multiple sclerosis and its pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
PtdIns(3)P plays critical roles in the autophagy pathway. However, little is known about how PtdIns(3)P effectors act with autophagy proteins in autophagosome formation. Here we identified an essential autophagy gene in C. elegans, epg-6, which encodes a WD40 repeat-containing protein with PtdIns(3)P-binding activity. EPG-6 directly interacts with ATG-2. epg-6 and atg-2 regulate progression of omegasomes to autophagosomes, and their loss of function causes accumulation of enlarged early autophagic structures. Another WD40 repeat PtdIns(3)P effector, ATG-18, plays a distinct role in autophagosome formation. We also established the hierarchical relationship of autophagy genes in degradation of protein aggregates and revealed that the UNC-51/Atg1 complex, EPG-8/Atg14, and binding of lipidated LGG-1 to protein aggregates are required for omegasome formation. Our study demonstrates that autophagic PtdIns(3)P effectors play distinct roles in autophagosome formation and also provides a framework for understanding the concerted action of autophagy genes in protein aggregate degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Epidermal growth factor receptors (ErbB1–4) are oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that regulate diverse cellular processes. In this study, we combine measurement and mathematical modeling to quantify phospho-turnover at ErbB receptors in human cells and to determine the consequences for signaling and drug binding. We find that phosphotyrosine residues on ErbB1 have half-lives of a few seconds and therefore turn over 100–1000 times in the course of a typical immediate-early response to ligand. Rapid phospho-turnover is also observed for EGF-activated ErbB2 and ErbB3, unrelated RTKs, and multiple intracellular adaptor proteins and signaling kinases. Thus, the complexes formed on the cytoplasmic tail of active receptors and the downstream signaling kinases they control are highly dynamic and antagonized by potent phosphatases. We develop a kinetic scheme for binding of anti-ErbB1 drugs to receptors and show that rapid phospho-turnover significantly impacts their mechanisms of action.

Abstract: Summary
The histone lysine methyltransferase NSD2 (MMSET/WHSC1) is implicated in diverse diseases and commonly overexpressed in multiple myeloma due to a recurrent t(4;14) chromosomal translocation. However, the precise catalytic activity of NSD2 is obscure, preventing progress in understanding how this enzyme influences chromatin biology and myeloma pathogenesis. Here, we show that dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me2) is the principal chromatin-regulatory activity of NSD2. Catalysis of H3K36me2 by NSD2 is sufficient for gene activation. In t(4;14)-positive myeloma cells, the normal genome-wide and gene-specific distribution of H3K36me2 is obliterated, creating a chromatin landscape that selects for a transcription profile favorable for myelomagenesis. Catalytically active NSD2 confers xenograft tumor formation upon t(4;14)-negative cells and promotes oncogenic transformation of primary cells in an H3K36me2-dependent manner. Together, our findings establish H3K36me2 as the primary product generated by NSD2 and demonstrate that genomic disorganization of this canonical chromatin mark by NSD2 initiates oncogenic programming.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful transmission of genomic information requires tight spatiotemporal regulation of DNA replication factors. In the licensing step of DNA replication, CDT-1 is loaded onto chromatin to subsequently promote the recruitment of additional replication factors, including CDC-45 and GINS. During the elongation step, the CDC-45/GINS complex moves with the replication fork; however, it is largely unknown how its chromatin association is regulated. Here, we show that the chaperone-like ATPase CDC-48/p97 coordinates degradation of CDT-1 with release of the CDC-45/GINS complex. C. elegans embryos lacking CDC-48 or its cofactors UFD-1/NPL-4 accumulate CDT-1 on mitotic chromatin, indicating a critical role of CDC-48 in CDT-1 turnover. Strikingly, CDC-48UFD-1/NPL-4-deficient embryos show persistent chromatin association of CDC-45/GINS, which is a consequence of CDT-1 stabilization. Moreover, our data confirmed a similar regulation in Xenopus egg extracts, emphasizing a conserved coordination of licensing and elongation events during eukaryotic DNA replication by CDC-48/p97.

Abstract: Summary
LDL receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) are coreceptors for Wnt growth factors, and also bind Dkk proteins, secreted inhibitors of Wnt signaling. The LRP5/6 ectodomain contains four β-propeller/EGF-like domain repeats. The first two repeats, LRP6(1-2), bind to several Wnt variants, whereas LRP6(3-4) binds other Wnts. We present the crystal structure of the Dkk1 C-terminal domain bound to LRP6(3-4), and show that the Dkk1 N-terminal domain binds to LRP6(1-2), demonstrating that a single Dkk1 molecule can bind to both portions of the LRP6 ectodomain and thereby inhibit different Wnts. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of LRP6(1-4) bound to a noninhibitory antibody fragment or to full-length Dkk1 shows that in both cases the ectodomain adopts a curved conformation that places the first three repeats at a similar height relative to the membrane. Thus, Wnts bound to either portion of the LRP6 ectodomain likely bear a similar spatial relationship to Frizzled coreceptors.

Abstract: Summary
In budding yeast, commitment to cell division corresponds to activating the positive feedback loop of G1 cyclins controlled by the transcription factors SBF and MBF. This pair of transcription factors has over 200 targets, implying that cell-cycle commitment coincides with genome-wide changes in transcription. Here, we find that genes within this regulon have a well-defined distribution of transcriptional activation times. Combinatorial use of SBF and MBF results in a logical OR function for gene expression and partially explains activation timing. Activation of G1 cyclin expression precedes the activation of the bulk of the G1/S regulon, ensuring that commitment to cell division occurs before large-scale changes in transcription. Furthermore, we find similar positive feedback-first regulation in the yeasts S. bayanus and S. cerevisiae, as well as human cells. The widespread use of the feedback-first motif in eukaryotic cell-cycle control, implemented by nonorthologous proteins, suggests its frequent deployment at cellular transitions.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy by activating the IGF1R/IRS1/PI3K/Akt pathway. However the effect of IGF1 in differentiated muscle is limited by IRS1 ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated breakdown. In skeletal muscle, IGF1R activation sensitizes IRS1 to degradation, and a screen for the responsible E3 ligase identified Fbxo40 as mediating this rapid turnover of IRS1, since IRS1 loss can be rescued by knockdown of Fbxo40. In biochemical assays, an SCF E3 ligase complex containing Fbxo40 directly ubiquitinates IRS1, and this activity is enhanced by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1. Fbxo40 is muscle specific in expression and is upregulated during differentiation. Knockdown of Fbxo40 induces dramatic hypertrophy of myofibers. Mice null for Fbxo40 have increased levels of IRS1 and demonstrate enhanced body and muscle size during the growth phase associated with elevated IGF1 levels. These findings establish an important means of restraining IGF1's effects on skeletal muscle.

Abstract: Summary
E1 enzymes activate ubiquitin-like proteins and transfer them to cognate E2 enzymes. Atg7, a noncanonical E1, activates two ubiquitin-like proteins, Atg8 and Atg12, and plays a crucial role in autophagy. Here, we report crystal structures of full-length Atg7 and its C-terminal domain bound to Atg8 and MgATP, as well as a solution structure of Atg8 bound to the extreme C-terminal domain (ECTD) of Atg7. The unique N-terminal domain (NTD) of Atg7 is responsible for Atg3 (E2) binding, whereas its C-terminal domain is comprised of a homodimeric adenylation domain (AD) and ECTD. The structural and biochemical data demonstrate that Atg8 is initially recognized by the C-terminal tail of ECTD and is then transferred to an AD, where the Atg8 C terminus is attacked by the catalytic cysteine to form a thioester bond. Atg8 is then transferred via a trans mechanism to the Atg3 bound to the NTD of the opposite protomer within a dimer.

Abstract: Summary
The kinesin-8 family of microtubule motors plays a critical role in microtubule length control in cells. These motors have complex effects on microtubule dynamics: they destabilize growing microtubules yet stabilize shrinking microtubules. The budding yeast kinesin-8, Kip3, accumulates on plus ends of growing but not shrinking microtubules. Here we identify an essential role of the tail domain of Kip3 in mediating both its destabilizing and its stabilizing activities. The Kip3 tail promotes Kip3's accumulation at the plus ends and facilitates the destabilizing effect of Kip3. However, the Kip3 tail also inhibits microtubule shrinkage and is required for promoting microtubule rescue by Kip3. These effects of the tail domain are likely to be mediated by the tubulin- and microtubule-binding activities that we describe. We propose a concentration-dependent model for the coordination of the destabilizing and stabilizing activities of Kip3 and discuss its relevance to cellular microtubule organization.

Abstract: Summary
Patterning the Drosophila retina for color vision relies on postmitotic specification of photoreceptor subtypes. R8 photoreceptors express one of two light-sensing Rhodopsins, Rh5 or Rh6. This fate decision involves a bistable feedback loop between Melted, a PH-domain protein, and Warts, a kinase in the Hippo growth pathway. Here, we show that a subset of the Hippo pathway—Merlin, Kibra, and Lethal(2)giant larvae (Lgl), but not Expanded or Fat—is required for Warts expression and activity in R8 to specify Rh6 fate. Melted represses warts transcription to disrupt Hippo pathway activity and specify Rh5 fate. Therefore, R8 Hippo signaling exhibits ON-or-OFF regulation, promoting mutually exclusive fates. Furthermore, Merlin and Lgl are continuously required to maintain R8 neuronal subtypes. These results reveal roles for Merlin, Kibra, and Lgl in neuronal specification and maintenance and show that the Hippo pathway is reimplemented for sensory neuron fate by combining canonical and noncanonical regulatory steps.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinases comprise the conserved machinery that drives progress through the cell cycle, but how they do this in mammalian cells is still unclear. To identify the mechanisms by which cyclin-cdks control the cell cycle, we performed a time-resolved analysis of the in vivo interactors of cyclins E1, A2, and B1 by quantitative mass spectrometry. This global analysis of context-dependent protein interactions reveals the temporal dynamics of cyclin function in which networks of cyclin-cdk interactions vary according to the type of cyclin and cell-cycle stage. Our results explain the temporal specificity of the cell-cycle machinery, thereby providing a biochemical mechanism for the genetic requirement for multiple cyclins in vivo and reveal how the actions of specific cyclins are coordinated to control the cell cycle. Furthermore, we identify key substrates (Wee1 and c15orf42/Sld3) that reveal how cyclin A is able to promote both DNA replication and mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
During embryogenesis, melanoblasts proliferate and migrate ventrally through the developing dermis and epidermis as single cells. Targeted deletion of Rac1 in melanoblasts during embryogenesis causes defects in migration, cell-cycle progression, and cytokinesis. Rac1 null cells migrate markedly less efficiently, but surprisingly, global steering, crossing the dermal/epidermal junction, and homing to hair follicles occur normally. Melanoblasts navigate in the epidermis using two classes of protrusion: short stubs and long pseudopods. Short stubs are distinct from blebs and are driven by actin assembly but are independent of Rac1, Arp2/3 complex, myosin, or microtubules. Rac1 positively regulates the frequency of initiation of long pseudopods, which promote migration speed and directional plasticity. Scar/WAVE and Arp2/3 complex drive actin assembly for long pseudopod extension, which also depends on microtubule dynamics. Myosin contractility balances the extension of long pseudopods by effecting retraction and allowing force generation for movement through the complex 3D epidermal environment.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes are cellular organelles primarily involved in degradation and recycling processes. During lysosomal exocytosis, a Ca2+-regulated process, lysosomes are docked to the cell surface and fuse with the plasma membrane (PM), emptying their content outside the cell. This process has an important role in secretion and PM repair. Here we show that the transcription factor EB (TFEB) regulates lysosomal exocytosis. TFEB increases the pool of lysosomes in the proximity of the PM and promotes their fusion with PM by raising intracellular Ca2+ levels through the activation of the lysosomal Ca2+ channel MCOLN1. Induction of lysosomal exocytosis by TFEB overexpression rescued pathologic storage and restored normal cellular morphology both in vitro and in vivo in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). Our data indicate that lysosomal exocytosis may directly modulate cellular clearance and suggest an alternative therapeutic strategy for disorders associated with intracellular storage.

Abstract: Septins, a conserved family of GTP-binding proteins with a conserved role in cytokinesis, are present in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to mammals. Septins are also highly expressed in neurons, which are post-mitotic cells. Septin6 (SEPT6) forms SEPT2/6/7 complexes in vivo. In this study, we produced a very specific SEPT6 antibody. Immunocytochemisty (ICC) of dissociated hippocampal cultures revealed that SEPT6 was highly expressed in neurons. Developmentally, the expression of SEPT6 was very low until stage 3 (axonal outgrowth). Significant expression of SEPT6 began at stage 4 (outgrowth of dendrites). At this stage, SEPT6 clusters were positioned at the branch points of developing dendrites. In maturing and mature neurons (stage 5), SEPT6 clusters were positioned at the base of filopodia and spines, and pre-synaptic boutons. Detergent extraction experiments also indicated that SEPT6 is not a post-synaptic density (PSD) protein. Throughout morphologic development of neurons, SEPT6 always formed tiny rings (external diameter, ~0.5 μm), which appear to be clusters at low magnification. When a Sept6 RNAi vector was introduced at the early developmental stage (DIV 2), a significant reduction in dendritic length and branch number was evident. Taken together, our results indicate that SEPT6 begins to be expressed at the stage of dendritic outgrowth and regulates the cytoarchitecture.

Abstract: Elevated [Ca2+]i in human red blood cells (RBCs) activates IK1 K+ channels leading to cell dehydration. NS309, a powerful IK1 agonist, has been shown to activate IK1 channels even at sub-physiological [Ca2+]i levels. An intriguing feature of this response is its all-or-none nature, with responsive cells dehydrating fully and refractory cells retaining normal volume. We investigated the mechanism of this response suspecting cell-age involvement. We expected the younger cells, with the more vigorous plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps (PMCA), to be the refractory cells because of their lower [Ca2+]i. Osmotic fragility measurements and density separation through phthalate oil were used to monitor red cell dehydration. The fraction of glycosilated haemoglobin (Hb A1c) was used to estimate the mean age of density fractionated cells. The results showed that inhibition of the PMCA by vanadate abolished the all-or-none response, that the mean age of the responsive cells was young, contrary to expectations, and that pump inhibition subsequent to an all-or-none response caused the refractory cells to dehydrate fully, suggesting that the all-or-none response resulted from a reduced efficiency of NS309 to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of IK1 channels in aged RBCs.

Abstract: Mast cells are considered the primary initiators of allergic diseases as a consequence of the release of multiple inflammatory mediators on activation. Although predominately activated through antigen-mediated aggregation of IgE-occupied-FcɛRI, they can also be induced to release mediators by other receptors and environmental stimuli. Based on studies conducted in the RBL 2H3 rodent mast cell line, the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) cation channel has been implicated in the activation of mast cells in response to cold and, by inference, the development of urticaria. Here we investigated the expression and role of TRPM8 receptor, in both human and mouse non-transformed cells, with the aim of exploring the potential link between TRPM8 and the pathology of cold urticaria in humans. Although expressed in mouse mast cells, we found no evidence of TRPM8 expression in human mast cells or functional mutations in TRPM8 in cold urticaria patients. Furthermore, neither mouse nor human primary cultured mast cells degranulated in response to cold challenge or TRPM8 agonists and mast cell reactivity was unaffected in Trpm8−/− mice. From these data, we conclude that TRPM8 is unlikely to directly regulate mast cell activation in cold urticaria. Thus, alternative mechanisms likely exist for the pathogenesis of this disease.

Abstract: Summary
The Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) is a human tumor suppressor whose inactivation is associated with the development of leiomyomata, renal cysts, and tumors. It has been proposed that activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) by fumarate-mediated inhibition of HIF prolyl hydroxylases drives oncogenesis. Using a mouse model, we provide genetic evidence that Fh1-associated cyst formation is Hif independent, as is striking upregulation of antioxidant signaling pathways revealed by gene expression profiling. Mechanistic analysis revealed that fumarate modifies cysteine residues within the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), abrogating its ability to repress the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response pathway, suggesting a role for Nrf2 dysregulation in FH-associated cysts and tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Decreased β cell mass and function are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes. Here we identified, through a siRNA screen, beta site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 2 (Bace2) as the sheddase of the proproliferative plasma membrane protein Tmem27 in murine and human β cells. Mice with functionally inactive Bace2 and insulin-resistant mice treated with a newly identified Bace2 inhibitor both display augmented β cell mass and improved control of glucose homeostasis due to increased insulin levels. These results implicate Bace2 in the control of β cell maintenance and provide a rational strategy to inhibit this protease for the expansion of functional pancreatic β cell mass.

Abstract: Summary
NADH is a key metabolic cofactor whose sensitive and specific detection in the cytosol of live cells has been difficult. We constructed a fluorescent biosensor of the cytosolic NADH-NAD+ redox state by combining a circularly permuted GFP T-Sapphire with a bacterial NADH-binding protein, Rex. Although the initial construct reported [NADH] × [H+] / [NAD+], its pH sensitivity was eliminated by mutagenesis. The engineered biosensor Peredox reports cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratios and can be calibrated with exogenous lactate and pyruvate. We demonstrated its utility in several cultured and primary cell types. We found that glycolysis opposed the lactate dehydrogenase equilibrium to produce a reduced cytosolic NADH-NAD+ redox state. We also observed different redox states in primary mouse astrocytes and neurons, consistent with hypothesized metabolic differences. Furthermore, using high-content image analysis, we monitored NADH responses to PI3K pathway inhibition in hundreds of live cells. As an NADH reporter, Peredox should enable better understanding of bioenergetics.

Abstract: Summary
Basement membranes (BMs) are resilient polymer structures that surround organs in all animals. Tissues, however, undergo extensive morphological changes during development. It is not known whether the assembly of BM components plays an active morphogenetic role. To study in vivo the biogenesis and assembly of Collagen IV, the main constituent of BMs, we used a GFP-based RNAi method (iGFPi) designed to knock down any GFP-trapped protein in Drosophila. We found with this method that Collagen IV is synthesized by the fat body, secreted to the hemolymph (insect blood), and continuously incorporated into the BMs of the larva. We also show that incorporation of Collagen IV determines organ shape, first by mechanically constricting cells and second through recruitment of Perlecan, which counters constriction by Collagen IV. Our results uncover incorporation of Collagen IV and Perlecan into BMs as a major determinant of organ shape and animal form.

Abstract: Summary
Sprouting angiogenesis expands the embryonic vasculature enabling survival and homeostasis. Yet how the angiogenic capacity to form sprouts is allocated among endothelial cells (ECs) to guarantee the reproducible anatomy of stereotypical vascular beds remains unclear. Here we show that Sema-PlxnD1 signaling, previously implicated in sprout guidance, represses angiogenic potential to ensure the proper abundance and stereotypical distribution of the trunk's segmental arteries (SeAs). We find that Sema-PlxnD1 signaling exerts this effect by antagonizing the proangiogenic activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Specifically, Sema-PlxnD1 signaling ensures the proper endothelial abundance of soluble flt1 (sflt1), an alternatively spliced form of the VEGF receptor Flt1 encoding a potent secreted decoy. Hence, Sema-PlxnD1 signaling regulates distinct but related aspects of angiogenesis: the spatial allocation of angiogenic capacity within a primary vessel and sprout guidance.

Abstract: Jolkinolide B, a bioactive diterpene isolated from the roots of Euphorbia fischeriana Steud, is known to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism of its anti-cancer activity has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we found that Jolkinolide B reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human leukemic U937. The induction of apoptosis was also accompanied by the downregulation of PI3K/Akt and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family proteins. Moreover, we observed that Jolkinolide B treatment resulted in activation of caspase-3 and -9, which may partly explain the anti-cancer activity of Jolkinolide B. Taken together, our study for the first time suggest that Jolkinolide B is able to enhance apoptosis of U937 cells, at least in part, through downregulation of PI3K/Akt and IAP family proteins. Moreover, triggering of caspase-3 and -9 activation mediated apoptotic induction.

Abstract: Escherichia coli is frequently used as a convenient host organism for soluble recombinant protein expression. However, additional strategies are needed for proteins with complex folding characteristics. Here, we suggested that the acidic, neutral, and alkaline isoelectric point (pI) range curves correspond to the channels of the E. coli type-II cytoplasmic membrane translocation (periplasmic translocation) pathways of twin-arginine translocation (Tat), Yid, and general secretory pathway (Sec), respectively, for unfolded and folded target proteins by examining the characteristic pI values of the N-termini of the signal sequences or the leader sequences, matching with the known diameter of the translocation channels, and analyzing the N-terminal pI value of the signal sequences of the Tat substrates. To confirm these proposed translocation pathways, we investigated the soluble expression of the folded green fluorescent protein (GFP) with short N-terminal polypeptides exhibiting pI and hydrophilicity separately or collectively. This, in turn, revealed the existence of an anchor function with a specific directionality based on the N-terminal pI value (termed as N-terminal pI-specific directionality) and distinguished the presence of the E. coli type-II cytoplasmic membrane translocation pathways of Tat, Yid, and Sec for the unfolded and folded target proteins. We concluded that the pI value and hydrophilicity of the short N-terminal polypeptide, and the total translational efficiency of the target proteins based on the ΔGRNA value of the N-terminal coding regions are important factors for promoting more efficient translocation (secretion) through the largest diameter of the Tat channel. These results show that the short N-terminal polypeptide could substitute for the Tat signal sequence with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
The glutathione redox couple (GSH/GSSG) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are central to redox homeostasis and redox signaling, yet their distribution within an organism is difficult to measure. Using genetically encoded redox probes in Drosophila, we establish quantitative in vivo mapping of the glutathione redox potential (EGSH) and H2O2 in defined subcellular compartments (cytosol and mitochondria) across the whole animal during development and aging. A chemical strategy to trap the in vivo redox state of the transgenic biosensor during specimen dissection and fixation expands the scope of fluorescence redox imaging to include the deep tissues of the adult fly. We find that development and aging are associated with redox changes that are distinctly redox couple-, subcellular compartment-, and tissue-specific. Midgut enterocytes are identified as prominent sites of age-dependent cytosolic H2O2 accumulation. A longer life span correlated with increased formation of oxidants in the gut, rather than a decrease.

Abstract: Summary
The NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 is an evolutionarily conserved metabolic sensor of the Sirtuin family that mediates homeostatic responses to certain physiological stresses such as nutrient restriction. Previous reports have implicated fluctuations in intracellular NAD+ concentrations as the principal regulator of SIRT1 activity. However, here we have identified a cAMP-induced phosphorylation of a highly conserved serine (S434) located in the SIRT1 catalytic domain that rapidly enhanced intrinsic deacetylase activity independently of changes in NAD+ levels. Attenuation of SIRT1 expression or the use of a nonphosphorylatable SIRT1 mutant prevented cAMP-mediated stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and gene expression linked to this pathway. Overexpression of SIRT1 in mice significantly potentiated the increases in fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure caused by either pharmacological β-adrenergic agonism or cold exposure. These studies support a mechanism of Sirtuin enzymatic control through the cAMP/PKA pathway with important implications for stress responses and maintenance of energy homeostasis.

Abstract: Hoxc8 is a homeobox gene family member, which is essential for growth and differentiation. Mgl1, a mouse homologue of the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene lgl, was previously identified as a possible target of Hoxc8. However, the biological effects and underlying molecular mechanism of Hoxc8 regulation on Mgl1 has not been fully established. The endogenous expression patterns of Hoxc8 were inversely correlated with those of Mgl1 in different types of cells and tissues. Here we showed that Hoxc8 overexpression downregulated the Mgl1 mRNA expression. Characterization of the ~2 kb Mgl1 promoter region revealed that the upstream sequence contains several putative Hox core binding sites and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that Hoxc8 directly binds to the 5’upstream region of Mgl1. The promoter activity of this region was diminished by Hoxc8 expression but resumed by knockdown of Hoxc8 using siRNA against Hoxc8. Functional study of Mgl1 in C3H10T1/2 cells revealed a significant reduction in cell adhesion upon expression of Hoxc8. Taken together, our data suggest that Hoxc8 downregulates Mgl1 expression via direct binding to the promoter region, which in turn reduces cell adhesion and concomitant cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Homeostatic control of oxygen availability allows cells to survive oxygen deprivation. Although the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is the main regulator of the hypoxic response, the upstream mechanisms required for its stabilization remain elusive. Here, we show that p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) undergoes hypoxia-induced γ-secretase-dependent cleavage to provide a positive feed-forward mechanism required for oxygen-dependent HIF-1α stabilization. The intracellular domain of p75NTR directly interacts with the evolutionarily conserved zinc finger domains of the E3 RING ubiquitin ligase Siah2 (seven in absentia homolog 2), which regulates HIF-1α degradation. p75NTR stabilizes Siah2 by decreasing its autoubiquitination. Genetic loss of p75NTR dramatically decreases Siah2 abundance, HIF-1α stabilization, and induction of HIF-1α target genes in hypoxia. p75NTR−/− mice show reduced HIF-1α stabilization, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, and neoangiogenesis after retinal hypoxia. Thus, hypoxia-induced intramembrane proteolysis of p75NTR constitutes an apical oxygen-dependent mechanism to control the magnitude of the hypoxic response.

Abstract: Platelet aggregation plays crucial roles in the formation of hemostatic plugs and thrombosis. Although it was recently shown that canonical Wnt signaling negatively regulates platelet aggregation, the role of non-canonical Wnt signaling remains unknown. Here, we observed that Wnt5a, one of the non-canonical Wnts, positively regulated platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation was potentiated by the addition of Wnt5a to collagen- or U46619-induced rat platelet rich plasma (PRP). Treatment with Wnt5a to U46619-stimulated PRP resulted in an increase in the level of phosphorylated Akt, whereas phosphorylation of PKCδ and JNK1 was unaffected. In addition, inhibition of PI3K blocked the potentiating effect of Wnt5a. Taken together, these results suggest that Wnt5a potentiates U46619-induced platelet aggregation via the PI3K/Akt pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The COP10-DET1-DDB1 (CDD) complex is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex discovered for its role in the repression of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis. It is important in many cellular and developmental processes in both plants and animals, but its molecular mode of action remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the CDD component DET1 possesses transcriptional repression activity and physically interacts with two closely related MYB transcription factors, CCA1 and LHY, which are core components of the plant circadian clock. DET1 associates with the promoter of CCA1/LHY target genes, such as TOC1, in a CCA1/LHY-dependent manner and is required for their repression, suggesting a recruitment of DET1 by the central oscillator components to regulate the clock. Our results reveal DET1 as a core transcriptional repression factor important for clock progression. Overall, the CDD complex may function as a transcriptional corepressor in diverse processes through direct interaction with distinct transcription factors.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene lead to the development of acute leukemias. Constitutive HOX gene activation by MLL fusion proteins is required for MLL-mediated leukemogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that chromobox homolog 8 (CBX8), a Polycomb Group protein that interacts with MLL-AF9 and TIP60, is required for MLL-AF9-induced transcriptional activation and leukemogenesis. Conversely, both CBX8 ablation and specific disruption of the CBX8 interaction by point mutations in MLL-AF9 abrogate HOX gene upregulation and abolish MLL-AF9 leukemic transformation. Surprisingly, Cbx8-deficient mice are viable and display no apparent hematopoietic defects. Together, our findings demonstrate that CBX8 plays an essential role in MLL-AF9 transcriptional regulation and leukemogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancer patients often develop locoregional or distant recurrence years after mastectomy. Understanding the mechanism of metastatic recurrence after dormancy is crucial for improving the cure rate for breast cancer. Here, we characterize a bone metastasis dormancy model to show that aberrant expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), in part dependent on the activity of the NF-κB pathway, promotes the transition from indolent micrometastasis to overt metastasis. By interacting with the cognate receptor integrin α4β1, VCAM-1 recruits monocytic osteoclast progenitors and elevates local osteoclast activity. Antibodies against VCAM-1 and integrin α4 effectively inhibit bone metastasis progression and preserve bone structure. These findings establish VCAM-1 as a promising target for the prevention and inhibition of metastatic recurrence in bone.

Abstract: Calcimycin (A23187) is an ionophore widely used in studies related to calcium dynamics in cells, but its fluorometric potential to reveal intracellular physiology has not been explored. Exploiting the microenvironment-induced changes in its fluorescence, we show that a brief exposure of cells to non-toxic concentrations (≤3μM) of the ionophore results in the characteristic organization of the ionophore forming brightly fluorescent cytoplasmic bodies termed “I-Bodies”, which are closely related to stress linked disturbances/changes in calcium homeostasis. “I-Bodies” appear to be Ca2+ rich intracellular sites formed during stress-induced release of intracellular Ca2+, causing dysfunction and aggregation of mitochondria, providing scaffold for high density packing of A23187. Formation of “I-Bodies” in cells exposed to ionizing radiation and certain anticancer drugs suggest their potential in revealing alterations in calcium signaling and mitochondrial function during (related to) macromolecular damage-induced cell death. The absence of “I-Bodies” in non-malignant cells and their varying numbers in malignant cells with 5 fold increase in fluorescence imply that they can be potential biomarkers of cancer. Thus, “I-Bodies” are novel indicators of endogenous and induced stress linked to disturbances in calcium homeostasis in cells, with a potential to serve as biomarker of cancer.
