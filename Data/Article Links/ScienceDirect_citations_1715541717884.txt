Abstract: In this study we investigate the performance of Cu(In1−x,Gax)Se2/Zn(O1−z,Sz) solar cells by changing the gallium content of the absorber layer in steps from CuInSe2 to CuGaSe2 and at each step vary the sulfur content of the Zn(O,S) buffer layer. By incorporating more or less sulfur into the Zn(O,S) buffer layer it is possible to change its morphology and band gap energy. Surprisingly, the best solar cells with Zn(O,S) buffer layers in this study are found for close to or the same Zn(O,S) buffer layer composition for all absorber Ga compositions. In comparison to their CdS references the best solar cells with Zn(O,S) buffer layers have slightly lower open circuit voltage, Voc, lower fill factor, FF, and higher short circuit current density, Jsc, which result in comparable or slightly lower conversion efficiencies. The exception to this trend is the CuGaSe2 solar cells, where the best devices with Zn(O,S) have substantially lowered efficiency compared with the CdS reference, because of lower Voc, FF and Jsc. X-ray photon spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements show that the best Zn(O,S) buffer layers have similar properties independent of the Ga content. In addition, energy dispersive spectroscopy scans in a transmission electron microscope show evidence of lateral variations in the Zn(O,S) buffer layer composition at the absorber/buffer layer interface. Finally, a hypothesis based on the results of the buffer layer analysis is suggested in order to explain the solar cell parameters.

Abstract: We studied CuInS2 (CIS) film growth using high electrostatic field assisted ultrasonic spray (HEFAUS) deposition. CIS films were fabricated with various precursors and substrate temperatures. All the as-sprayed CIS films were observed to be grown with mixed ordering mode, where chalcopyrite (CH) and CuAu (CA) orderings coexisted. It was found that application of additional sulfurization to sprayed CIS films induced re-crystallization of films accompanied by enhancement of CH ordering. After the post-sulfurization, the most improved film showed nearly the same CH-fraction as that for a CIS film which was made by sulfurization of sputtered Cu–In alloy film. These results indicate that our modified spray deposition could be used for fabrication of CIS photoabsorbing layer instead of high-cost vacuum-based process. All fabricated films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray analysis measurements.

Abstract: Quantitative phase analysis of Cu(In1−xGax)Se2 (CIGS) thin film grown over Mo coated soda lime glass substrates was studied by Rietveld refinement process using room temperature X-ray data at θ–2θ mode. Films were found to contain both stoichiometric Cu(In1−xGax)Se2 and defect related Cu(In1−xGax)3Se5 phases. Best fitting was obtained using crystal structure with space group I-42d for Cu(In1−xGax)Se2 and I-42m for Cu(In1−xGax)3Se5 phase. The effects of Ga/III (=Ga/In+Ga=x) ratio and Se flux during growth over the formation of Cu(In1−xGax)3Se5 defect phase in CIGS was studied and the correlation between quantity of Cu(In1−xGax)3Se5 phase and solar cell performance is discussed.

Abstract: Hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) growth by very high frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (VHF-PECVD) is studied in an industrial-type parallel plate KAI reactor. Combined plasma and material characterization techniques allow to assess critical deposition parameters for the fabrication of high quality material. A relation between low intrinsic stress of the deposited i-layer and better performing solar cell devices is identified. Significant solar cell device improvements were achieved based on these findings: high open circuit voltages above 520mV and fill factors above 74% were obtained for 1μm thick μc-Si:H single junction cells and a 1.2cm2 micromorph device with 12.3% initial (Voc=1.33V, FF=72.4%, Jsc=12.8mAcm−2) and above 10.0% stabilized efficiencies.

Abstract: In this study, it was aimed to remove boron, one of the major impurities of MG-Si (metallic grade silicon), in molten silicon by a steam plasma method utilizing EMC (electro magnetic casting) process. In order to effectively remove boron, less volatile than silicon, plasma injection gas was systematically varied. As a result, the most effective way to remove boron was additionally injecting hydrogen gas and steam with argon gas, which is a reactive gas of a general plasma injection routine. Although mass loss of silicon increased with increase in plasma injection time, the refining effect of boron and several metallic impurities like aluminium and titanium was improved significantly.

Abstract: VO2–ZrV2O7 composite films were prepared on silica glass substrates by polymer-assisted deposition using a V–Zr–O solution. The coexistence of ZrV2O7 and VO2 was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, glance angle X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The composite films with similar thickness of about 95nm showed decreased particle sizes and significantly enhanced luminous transmittances (from 32.3% at Zr/V=0 to 53.4% at Zr/V=0.12) with increasing Zr/V rations. The enhancement in the luminous transmittance was ascribed to the absorption-edge changes in the composite films. This feature benefits the application of VO2 to smart windows.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
The optimal treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) is not well defined, in part because these patients are underrepresented in clinical studies. Autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) after high-dose melphalan chemotherapy can result in a prolonged response duration and survival in patients under 65 years of age.
DESIGN AND SETTING
Single-center, retrospective study of patients treated at Paoli-Calmettes Institute Cancer Centre, between January 1994 and January 2007 (96months)
PATIENTS AND METHODS
We compared the outcome of elderly (age >65years) patients with younger patients aged between 60 and 65 years with MM.
RESULTS
We compared 82 elderly patients with 104 younger patients. Except for age, both groups had comparable demographic features, disease characteristics, and prognostic factors. Induction VAD chemotherapy was comparable between the elderly (87%) and younger (94%) group. Prior to auto-SCT, the calculated hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific co-morbidity index was also comparable. With a median follow-up of 41 months (range, 5-227 months) after auto-SCT, 120 patients were still alive. Disease progression (n=40; 61%) was the main cause of death, and it was comparable in the two groups. Auto-SCT-related mortality was 3.8% (n=4/104) in younger and 3.7% (n=3/82) in older patients. Comparing younger/older subjects, progression-free survival was significantly higher in the younger group (P<.0001). However, disease response rates after the first auto-SCT was comparable and overall survival (OS) was also comparable (57% vs. 54% at 5 years, P=NS; 32% vs. 24% at 10 years, P=NS). In a Cox multivariate analysis model, none of the relevant characteristics was shown to be a critical prognostic feature for OS.
CONCLUSIONS
Age was insignificant for both OS and transplant-related mortality. We conclude that there is no biological justification for an age-discriminate policy for MM therapy. Physiologic aging is likely more important than chronologic aging.

Abstract: Light-induced stability of various p–i–n type wide-gap a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells has been systematically investigated. The i-layers of all a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells were prepared using a 60MHz VHF-PECVD technique with monomethyl silane (SiH3CH3, MMS) as the carbon source. It was confirmed that device structures, especially the type of buffer layer and thickness of i-layer, strongly affect the degradation behavior of a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells. The fabricated a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells showed efficiency degradation of about 11–22% depending on device structure. Efficiency degradation of optimized a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells was much better compared with those reported by other groups even with thinner i-layer. These results revealed that a-Si1−xCx:H solar cells with optimized buffer layer and prepared using MMS as the carbon source have high light-induced stability. Moreover, we have also fabricated a-Si1−xCx:H/a-Si:H tandem cells with a SiOx intermediate layer to examine the benefit of a-Si1−xCx:H top cells. Up to now, Voc as high as 1.81V and fill factor (FF) as high as 0.70 have been achieved. Thus, the fabricated a-Si1−xCx:H solar cell is promising to be used as the top cell in multijunction solar cells.

Moesin–ezrin–radixin-like protein (merlin) mediates protein interacting with the carboxyl terminus-1 (PICT-1)-induced growth inhibition of glioblastoma cells in the nucleus,

Abstract: Moesin–ezrin–radixin-like protein (merlin) has long been considered a unique tumour suppressor that inhibits mitogenic signalling only at the membrane–cytoskeleton interface. However, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of merlin in a cell cycle-dependent manner has recently been observed, indicating that merlin may also exert its tumour-suppressive activity by interacting with specific nuclear protein partners. We have identified protein interacting with carboxyl terminus 1 (PICT-1) as a novel merlin-binding partner. Although the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood, several lines of evidence have previously implicated PICT-1 as a candidate tumour suppressor, including its phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-dependent growth-suppression and cell-killing activities. We show here that PICT-1 is localised to the nucleolus, and Ser518-dephosphorylated merlin (the growth-inhibitory form of merlin) can interact with PICT-1 in the nucleolus. Ectopic expression of PICT-1, both in PTEN-positive HeLa cells and in PTEN-deficient U251 cells, effectively represses cyclin D1 expression, arrests the cell cycle at G0/G1, and promotes cell apoptosis. PICT-1 (1–356), a carboxyl-terminus truncated mutant that has lost the ability to bind merlin, has a markedly reduced inhibitory effect on the cell cycle and proliferation. Knockdown of merlin expression by siRNA attenuates the inhibitory effects induced by PICT-1 over-expression. We propose that merlin mediates PICT-1-induced growth inhibition by translocating to the nucleolus and binding PICT-1.

Abstract: Thin film chalcopyrite solar cells grown on light-weight, flexible substrates are an appealing product. An insulating barrier layer is a requisite for flexible steel substrates to protect the chalcopyrite absorber layer from in-diffusion of iron and also to isolate the solar module, electrically, from the metal substrate. Spray pyrolysis is presented here as a means to deposit an aluminium oxide barrier layer. Optimised spray deposition conditions are investigated and subsequent solar cell results are presented. Resistivity measurements in conjunction with thermography allow assessment of the barrier layer’s insulating properties and occurrence of pin-holes in the layer. Resulting Cu(In,Ga)Se2 cells, with a barrier layer, reach an efficiency of 14.4%.

Abstract: The nano-grain ZnO/SnO2 composite electrode was prepared by adding 5w% of the 200–250nm ZnO particles to the 5nm SnO2 colloid in the presence of hydroxypropylcellulose (M.W.=80,000). The nano-grain SnO2 electrode was obtained by removing the ZnO particles from the composite electrode using acetic acid. The FE-SEM micrographs revealed that both electrodes consisted of interconnected nano-grains that were ca. 800nm in size, and the large pores between the grains furnished the wide electrolyte diffusion channels within the electrodes. The photovoltaic properties of the nano-grain electrodes were investigated by measuring the I–V behaviors, the IPCE spectra and the ac-impedance spectra. The nano-grain electrodes exhibited remarkably improved conversion efficiencies of 3.96% for the composite and 2.98% for the SnO2 electrode compared to the value of 1.66% for the usual nano-particle SnO2 electrode. The improvement conversion efficiencies were mainly attributed to the formation of nano-grains, which facilitated the electron diffusion within the grains. The improved electrolyte diffusion as well as the light-scattering effects enhanced the photovoltaic performance of the SnO2 electrode.

Abstract: This work investigates the formation of photoluminescence (PL) centres in high-transmission glasses (HTG) doped with Cu2O and their capability to transform the solar spectrum by absorption/emission via upconversion, downconversion and Stokes-shifted PL into a more efficient spectrum for photovoltaic applications. Both the green PL Cu+ and the non-PL Cu2+ centres are formed in HTG, although their relative concentration depends on the thermal treatment and the presence of other codopants. Given that the absorption spectrum of Cu+ lies around the HTG band gap, measurement of the absorption coefficient α(λ) for these absorption bands is not easy due to corrections between the reflection coefficient and chromatic dispersion. We present a procedure, named two-thickness method, to extract the actual absorption coefficient for the spectrum of each formed centre. In addition it provides the relative Cu+/Cu2+ concentration as well as their absolute values. Analysis of the spectra also provides information on the absorption cross section, transition energy and bandwidth of each band, the knowledge of which is essential to check the suitability of such centres for photovoltaic applications in silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Reliable process control or predictions of solar cell efficiencies from minority carrier lifetimes on silicon wafers require precise lifetime measurements. For inhomogeneous material quality this implies the necessity of adequately averaged spatially resolved lifetime measurements. Materials such as, e.g. multicrystalline upgraded metallurgical grade silicon frequently feature relatively low lifetimes, high trap densities, and several material parameters (charge carrier mobilities and net dopant concentration) that are not straightforwardly predictable or measurable. As this may substantially compromise conventional lifetime measurements, we present a solely luminescence based lifetime imaging technique, which requires virtually no a priori information about material parameters. Our approach is based on a calibration of a wafer's photoluminescence image through a precise lifetime determination of a part of this wafer via quasi-steady-state photoluminescence. Carrier mobilities, net dopant concentration, and surface morphology leave the determination of lifetime virtually unaffected, the injection dependence of lifetime is properly taken into account, and lifetimes down to the timescale of a microsecond can be reliably measured.

Abstract: We fabricate NIR-active solar cells based on PbS quantum dots and a conventional conjugated polymer. These devices act as solar cells under exclusively NIR wavelengths above 650nm. Here PbS nanoparticles absorb photons in the NIR range that in turn generate excitons. We show that with an assistance from a strong electron-acceptor (TiO2), these excitons can be dissociated to electrons and holes to yield a photocurrent in the external circuit. We then aim to extend the spectral window of the solar cells to higher wavelength region by increasing the diameter of PbS nanoparticles to make the cells further NIR-active. We observe that the short-circuit current (JSC) shows a peak when the diameter of PbS nanoparticles increases. Here, the spectral window can be extended till conduction band-edge of PbS quantum dots falls below that of TiO2 nanostructures cutting off the electron-transfer pathway. The NIR-active photovoltaic solar cells yield a short-circuit current (JSC) of 1.0mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.42V, and power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.16% and remain operative till 1200nm.

Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) and PL decay characteristics of the near-band-edge (NBE) PL at room temperature have been studied on the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells. The carrier recombination process has been discussed with emphasis on the photovoltaic properties of the solar cell. It has been found that: (i) PL intensity of the CIGS solar cells is much stronger than that in the corresponding CIGS thin films, (ii) the PL decay time of the cell is longer than that of the CIGS film, and (iii) the PL decay time of the CIGS solar cell exhibits strong dependence on the PL excitation intensity. In the CIGS solar cell, intense PL is obtained under the open circuit condition (oc), in contrast to the very low PL yield under the short circuit (sc) condition. The PL decay time under the sc condition is much shorter than that under the oc condition. Excitation intensity dependence of PL intensity and the PL decay time have been studied, and they are discussed with relation to the photo-voltage due to the PL excitation light. PL and injection EL under the external DC bias have been studied. The mapping image of NBE-PL intensity has been compared with that of the laser beam induced current (LBIC), and the PL intensity image reflects the photovoltaic properties of the CIGS solar cells. We demonstrated that NBE-PL of the CIGS solar cell reflects the photovoltaic effect, and it can be utilized as a powerful characterization method.

Abstract: Properties of heavily boron-doped hydrogenated polycrystalline germanium (Ge) films sputter-deposited on glass are investigated for developing p+ emitters of the bottom cells of low cost monolithic tandem solar cells. The films were deposited and in-situ doped by co-sputtering Ge with boron at various power levels (PB) in a mixture of argon and hydrogen at 500°C, and then followed by a rapid thermal anneal process at 550°C for 120s or 600°C for 60s, respectively. The dependence of the structural properties of the films on the various boron incorporations as well as annealing conditions was explored by Raman and X-ray diffraction measurements. We find that the films as deposited at 500°C are polycrystalline with strong (220) preferential orientation, which are normally of columnar structure, confirmed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. Revealed by Hall measurements, a boron activation level of 6.24×1019atoms/cm3, well above reported maximum solid solubility in crystalline Ge, was obtained in the as deposited film at PB=55W. Annealing at 600°C enhanced the concentration to 1.21×1020atoms/cm3. A fact that boron hardly diffuses in Ge at temperatures below 800°C makes the resultant material an excellent candidate for thin p+ emitters of the bottom cells of monolithic tandem solar cells.

Abstract: Al-doped zinc oxide/silver (ZnO:Al/Ag) back reflectors for silicon thin-film solar cells with an n–i–p configuration were prepared on flexible stainless steel substrates by dc magnetron sputtering. The surface morphologies of the back reflectors were modified by changing the deposition temperature of the Ag films to improve the light-scattering properties on the back reflectors, resulting in the enhancement of the light-trapping effect in the solar cells. By elevating the deposition temperature from room temperature to 500°C, the surface roughness of the Ag films increased from 6.62 to 46.64nm. The films at 500°C had coarse surface features with irregular grain size distributions between 200 and 900nm, whereas the films produced at low temperatures below 100°C had smooth surfaces consisting of small grains between 100 and 200nm. Even after the 100-nm thick ZnO:Al films were deposited on the modified Ag surfaces, the surface microstructure of the ZnO:Al/Ag bilayers was similar to that of the Ag films. The surface roughness of bilayers increased from 7.12 to 39.30nm with coarsening the Ag surfaces. Haze factor (a ratio of diffuse reflectance to total reflectance) of Ag films was enhanced remarkably from 59% to 74% in a wide wavelength range from 350 to 1100nm with increasing the surface roughness of the Ag films from 6.62nm to 46.64nm. Enhancement in the haze factor was due to the increase of diffuse reflectance on the Ag films, because the total reflectance did not change much with increasing surface roughness of the Ag films. This increasing roughness indicated that the light scattering from the rough surface of the back reflectors improved. The enhanced light scattering from the back reflectors influenced the performance of the solar cells mainly in terms of the short-circuit current density (Jsc). Compared to the back reflectors with smooth surface features, leading to a Jsc value of 9.94mA/cm2, the back reflectors with large surface roughness improved the Jsc value of the solar cells to 13.36mA/cm2 without detrimental changes in the fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (Voc); they eventually increased the conversion efficiency of the solar cells from 5.59% to 7.60%.

Abstract: Treatment for most patients with head and neck cancers includes ionizing radiation. A consequence of this treatment is irreversible damage to salivary glands (SGs), which is accompanied by a loss of fluid-secreting acinar-cells and a considerable decrease of saliva output. While there are currently no adequate conventional treatments for this condition, cell-based therapies are receiving increasing attention to regenerate SGs. In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can differentiate into salivary epithelial cells and restore SG function in head and neck irradiated mice. BMDCs from male mice were transplanted into the tail-vein of 18Gy-irradiated female mice. Salivary output was increased in mice that received BMDCs transplantation at week 8 and 24 post-irradiation. At 24 weeks after irradiation (IR), harvested SGs (submandibular and parotid glands) of BMDC-treated mice had greater weights than those of non-treated mice. Histological analysis shows that SGs of treated mice demonstrated an increased level of tissue regenerative activity such as blood vessel formation and cell proliferation, while apoptotic activity was increased in non-transplanted mice. The expression of stem cell markers (Sca-1 or c-kit) was detected in BMDC-treated SGs. Finally, we detected an increased ratio of acinar-cell area and approximately 9% of Y-chromosome-positive (donor-derived) salivary epithelial cells in BMDC-treated mice. We propose here that cell therapy using BMDCs can rescue the functional damage of irradiated SGs by direct differentiation of donor BMDCs into salivary epithelial cells.

Abstract: Background
Improved non-invasive imaging biomarkers of treatment response contribute to optimising cancer management and metabolites detected by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) show promise in this area. Understanding 1H MRS changes occurring in cells during cell stress and cell death in vitro should aid the selection of pertinent biomarkers for clinical use.
Methods
BT4C glioma cells in culture were exposed to either 50μM cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum II (cisplatin) or starvation by culture in phosphate buffered saline. High resolution magic angle spinning 1H MRS was performed on cells using a Varian 600MHz nanoprobe and metabolites were quantified by a time domain fitting method. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue, H&E, 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), DNA laddering and annexin V-FITC labelled flow cytometry; propidium iodide flow cytometry was used to assess the cell cycle phase.
Results
With cisplatin exposure, cells initially accumulated in the G1 stage of the cell cycle with low numbers of apoptotic and necrotic cells and this was associated with decreases in phosphocholine, succinate, alanine, taurine, glycine and glutamate and increases in lactate and glycerophosphocholine (GPC). Starvation, leading to necrotic cell death within 6–18h, caused decreases in succinate, alanine, glycine, and glutamate and increases in GPC. Principal component analysis revealed two patterns of metabolite changes, one common to both types of cell stress and another specific for necrosis secondary to cell starvation.
Conclusions
1H MRS reveals alterations in multiple metabolites during cell cycle arrest and cell death which may provide early biomarker profiles of treatment efficacy in vivo.

Abstract: The trend of cell miniaturization in concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) – currently in mm-scale and motivated by efficiency improvements linked to reduced series resistance – begs the question whether fundamental energetic considerations limit ultra-miniaturization. Mitigating factors subsume the busbars and metallization grid, the contributions of which embody subtle tradeoffs and vary non-trivially as cell size is reduced – evaluated via a distributed circuit simulation model, with some supporting experimental evidence. Concurrently, the influence of cell size on how metal grid design can lower series resistance is assessed, prompted by micro-concentrators that completely eliminate grid shadowing and allow far greater metallization coverage.

Abstract: In this work we analyzed the crystallinity of hydrogenated amorphous Si thin films deposited on n-type Si substrates using the effective medium approximation (EMA) method of a spectroscopic ellipsometer (SE) and evaluated their passivation quality by measuring effective carrier lifetime (τeff) and implied Voc using quasi-steady-state photo conductance decay (QSSPC) simultaneously. The crystalline volume fraction of doped a-Si:H layers using RF-PECVD was controlled from ∼0% (nearly full amorphous phase) to above 90% (nearly polycrystalline phase) through varying deposition conditions. The passivation property depended on the crystallinity more strongly for p-a-Si:H than n-a-Si:H of which crystallinity was more sensitive to deposition rate relatively. The implied Voc above 650mV was achieved with crystallinity less than about 5% for p-a-Si:H and 20% for n-a-Si:H. The HRTEM images confirmed the reliability of SE analysis with EMA modeling and showed the maximum part of crystalline phase exists at the interface of a-Si:H and c-Si in the form of epitaxial growth configuration. By the optimization of each a-Si:H deposition conditions 17.17% the cell efficiency was accomplished on non-textured substrate.

Abstract: Light trapping is a key issue to boost the efficiency of thin-film Si solar cells including μc-Si:H. In this paper, effect of textured back reflectors on light trapping in μc-Si:H cells has been investigated with self-orderly patterned Al substrates obtained by anodic oxidation. With increase in the period of the patterned substrates from 0 to 1.1μm, the short circuit current densities of 1-μm-thick μc-Si:H cells on the patterned substrates significantly increase from 18 to over 24mA/cm2, which is attributed to the improved light trapping in the infrared region. It has been clarified that this enhanced light-trapping effect in longer wavelengths is mainly attributed to the improved light scattering at the rear side by comparing μc-Si:H solar cells with polished and as-deposited front surfaces. The effectiveness of the patterned Al substrates has also been demonstrated in an a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem cell with a bottom cell thickness of 1μm, showing a higher conversion efficiency than the reference cell.

Abstract: We fabricated Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films using two different methods, spray pyrolysis and sulfurization of Cu–Zn–Sn metallic films. Spray pyrolysis was carried out under air ambient with modified ultrasonic spray system. Sulfurizations of metallic Cu–Zn–Sn films were done for stacked metallic films, Cu/Sn/Zn/glass, Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn/glass and Sn/Cu/Zn/glass, which were prepared by sputtering method in high vacuum chamber. The sprayed films were not observed to be grown well with good crystallinity, compared with CZTS films made by sulfurization of stacked metallic films. However, it was found that application of additional sulfurization to sprayed CZTS films induced great improvement of crystallinity to the level of the sulfurized metallic films. This implicates that spray pyrolysis with additional sulfurization is a good method for fabrication of CZTS films, especially as a low-cost fabrication technique. All CZTS films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy measurements.

Abstract: A silicon photovoltaic module converts sunlight energy into electricity applying the photovoltaic effect of the semiconductor. But the performance of PV module is affected by ambient temperature. It is well known that the power and efficiency of PV module usually falls at a rate of ∼0.5%/°C and ∼0.05%/°C, respectively as increase of ambient temperature. In this study, the thermal characteristics of a PV module by change of ambient temperature from −25°C in minimum to 50°C in maximum is investigated through a thermal analysis simulation program. In the end, a simulation method to attach fins to the backside of PV module is discussed. This work shows the comparison of the thermal characteristics between a PV module with and without fins.

Abstract: In order to manufacture high-efficiency Si solar cells with a passivated rear surface and local contacts, it is necessary to develop both an excellent rear-passivation scheme compatible with screen-printing technology and a robust patterning technique for local contact formation. In this work, we have fabricated Si solar cells on ∼130μm thick substrates using manufacturable processing, where rear side was passivated with a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited SiOx/SiNx/SiOxNy stack and local back contacts using laser. As a result of both the rear surface passivation stack and the laser-fired local contacts, cell efficiencies of up to 17.6% on a 148.6cm2 Float-zone Si wafer and 17.2% for a 156.8cm2 multicrystalline Si wafer were achieved. PC-1D calculations revealed that the cells had a back surface recombination velocity (BSRV) of ∼400cm/s and a back surface reflectance (BSR) of over 90%, as opposed to standard full Al-BSF cells having a BSRV of ∼800cm/s and a 70% BSR. This result clearly indicates that the new technique of the passivation scheme and the patterning using laser developed in this study are promising for manufacturing high-efficiency PERC-type thin Si solar cells.

Abstract: The composition and the microstructure evolutions of CuInSe2 thin films under single-bath electrodeposition processes were investigated. It was found that the film composition was mainly determined by the [Se4+]/[Cu2+] ratios in solution, but the film microstructure is strongly dependent on the initial concentrations of Se4+, Cu2+, and In3+ precursors. Higher initial concentrations of Cu2+ and In3+ in solution are beneficial for the fabrication of compact CuInSe2 thin films with highly crystallized and large grain sized chalcopyrite phase. The microstructure evolution suggests that prior adsorption and reduction of Cu2+ ions and the formation of Cu2Se compound on the substrate can promote the nucleation, growth, and coarsening of CuInSe2 crystal to form a high quality thin film during the electrodeposition processes.

Abstract: Screen-printing is considered to be the most efficient technique for large-scale Si solar cell production. Doping technique currently in use, such as POCl3 diffusion furnace, H3PO4 spray doping and spin-on-doping (SOD) tend to be time-consuming and wasteful of source materials. Screen printing technology can be used for the application of doping substance for diffusion. Diffusion paste doping by the support of screen printing has enough potential to overcome the disadvantages of other doping techniques. This paper demonstrates a simple method for creation of P–N junction, with efficiency above 16.1%, using a screen printable phosphorus diffusion paste. To optimize the doping process using screen printing, we varied several experimental conditions, including firing temperatures and time. A fill factor above 77% has been reached, with an efficiency of 16.1% in a 10.0cm×10.0cm. The high fill factor with paste doping is mainly due to a contact resistance (3.53Ω) lower than that for POCl3 (5.64Ω). These results could be applied to the manufacturing of low cost, simplified and high efficiency Si solar cells.

Abstract: Thermal degradation mechanism of the self-assembled thin films of [Ru(dcbpyH)2-(CN)2] (Ruthenium 505, R505) anchoring on TiO2 surfaces via its carboxylate group has been examined by temperature-dependent diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. The CN stretching bands of R505 at 2000–2100cm−1 appeared to change drastically at ≈140°C on TiO2 surfaces, whereas a major CN peak at ∼2090cm−1 disappeared at a much higher temperature above ≈250°C in their solid states. Two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis was introduced to explain the thermal desorption behaviors of the Ruthenium dye. Multiple peaks of the CN stretching vibrations are more clearly resolved in the 2D correlation analysis. More complicated features in the CN stretching vibrational spectra on TiO2 than those of the solid states suggest a substantial interaction of the CN groups with the TiO2 surfaces.

Abstract: The use of inorganic nano-semiconductor/polymer blend as the active layer for organic bulk hetero-junction solar cell is an alternative to change and improve the device characteristics and performance. Effects of CdSe/P3HT composition in the blend and its loading amount in the solvent on the electrical and structural properties of active layers formed were investigated. The results of atomic force microscopy study indicated that the surface roughness of composite active layer could be controlled below 10nm for the entire range of composite loading amount investigated in this study. The transmission line method experiments have demonstrated that the electrical percolation pathways could be developed at the critical loading amount of CdSe/P3HT composite, resulting in the abrupt decrease of sheet resistance and significant increase in the power conversion efficiency of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(CdSe/P3HT)/Al solar cell.

Abstract: Prognostic markers that can distinguish indolent from aggressive prostate cancer could have substantial patient benefit, helping to target patients most in need of radical intervention, while avoiding overtreatment of a highly prevalent condition. The search for novel cancer biomarkers has been facilitated by the development of technologies for “global” biomolecular profiling, used in the sciences of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolic profiling (metabonomics/metabolomics). Using an NMR-based approach we compared intracellular and extracellular metabolic profiles from the immortalised, non-tumourigenic prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE-1 and two tumourigenic sublines with increasing malignant phenotypes, WPE1-NB14 and WPE1-NB11, generated by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) mutagenesis. Collectively, these cell lines present an in vitro model of prostate cancer progression and disease aggression. We observed progressive alterations to intracellular levels of multiple metabolites from choline and branched chain amino acid metabolic pathways from RWPE-1 to WPE1-NB14 to WPE1-NB11 cells. In addition specific perturbations to intracellular glycine and lactate and extracellular lactate and alanine were observed relative to the parent line. The pathways implicated by comparative metabolic profiling in this model are known to be altered in human prostate cancer, and potentially represent a source of biomarkers for prostate cancer aggression.

Abstract: We introduce the material hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HATCN) as electron conducting window layer for separating the photoactive region from the cathode in organic p–i–n type solar cells. HATCN has a wide band gap of 3.3eV and is thus transparent in the visible range of the solar spectrum. Its electrical properties can be tuned by means of molecular n-doping which leads to an increase of electron conductivity by several orders of magnitude up to 2.2×10−4S/cm. However, an application in photovoltaic devices is restrained by its exceptionally high electron affinity, estimated 4.8eV, which introduces an electron injection barrier to the photoactive acceptor material C60. Here, we present a strategy to remove this barrier by means of introducing doped and undoped C60 intermediate layers, thus demonstrating the importance of energy level matching in a multiple layer structure and the advantages of Fermi level control by doping.

Abstract: An improved technique of measuring the upper sheet resistance (Rsheet) limit of a single laser-doped (LD) line has been presented. Probing pads of a structure based on the transfer length method (TLM) principle are formed by laser doping without any further metallization step, forming a fast, simple, and inexpensive measurement technique that is applicable to both textured and planar silicon wafers with or without any silicon nitride (SiNx) dielectric. It has been demonstrated that within the scope of using a laser to form lines with Rsheet less than 15Ω/□, this TLM method seems to be an accurate and reliable method to characterize the sheet resistance of a single laser-doped line. Investigations here also suggest that the sheet resistance of a laser-doped rectangular area (LD box) formed by overlapping multiple laser-doped lines on crystalline silicon wafers and measured using the four-point probe cannot accurately or reliably represent the sheet resistance of a single LD line that is laser doped under the same laser-scribing condition. This is mainly because of (1) the tendency of the high power laser to introduce electrically detrimental cracks onto the laser-doped box, (2) the unknown appropriate spacing between adjacent LD lines that should be used when forming the LD box, and (3) the ambiguity of overdoping that makes an LD box unsuitable to represent a single LD line at all. The TLM method proposed here not only avoids these problems but is also able to self-justify its own predicted upper limit values.

Abstract: Epitaxial boron-doped emitters by CVD can provide a valuable alternative to the use of aluminum or diffused boron for the creation of p-type emitters. Compared to the traditional boron-diffused emitters for high-efficiency cells, epitaxial emitters need shorter process time, no boron skin removal step and have more opportunities to optimize the emitter doping profile. Our work proves that epitaxial emitters can be a good alternative for the p-type emitter. Very promising cell results with the highest cell efficiency of 17.0% on FZ material with LPCVD emitter and 16.7% on CZ material with APCVD emitter under 1Sun have been achieved. Good fill factors have been obtained, which indicate good metal contacts are obtained on the epitaxial emitter. Cell results on n-type material are very encouraging and indicate a high potential of such epitaxial emitters for rear junction n-type solar cells.

Abstract: We fabricated hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) solar cells on SnO2 coated glass using a seed layer insertion technique. Since rich hydrogen atoms from the μc-Si:H deposition process degrade the SnO2 layer, we applied p-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (p-a-Si:H) as a window layer. To grow the μc-Si:H layer on the p-a-Si:H window layer, we developed a seed layer insertion method. We inserted the seed layer between the p-a-Si:H layer and intrinsic bulk μc-Si:H. This seed layer consists of a thin hydrogen diluted silicon buffer layer and a naturally hydrogen profiled layer. We compared the characteristics of solar cells with and without the seed layer. When the seed layer was not applied, the fabricated cell showed the characteristics of a-Si:H solar cell whose spectral response was in a range of 400–800nm. Using the seed layer, we achieved a μc-Si:H solar cell with performance of Voc=0.535V, Jsc=16.0mA/cm2, FF=0.667, and conversion efficiency=5.7% without any back reflector. The spectral response was in the range of 400–1100nm. Also, the fabricated device has little substrate dependence, because a-Si:H has weaker substrate selectivity than μc-Si:H.

Abstract: A new approach to reduce phosphorous contamination in the intrinsic layer during the deposition of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) n–i–p solar cells prepared in single-chamber reactors is presented. This novel process consists of a hydrogen etching plasma performed after the n-layer deposition, which prevents a recycling of phosphorous from the reactor walls when exposed to a hydrogen-rich plasma during the subsequent i-layer deposition. The implemented process reduces the phosphorous cross-contamination in the i-layer, as corroborated by secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, the end of the etching process can be easily monitored by measuring the DC bias voltage at the powered electrode. By applying this process, we were able to improve the fill factor from 70% up to 75%, without degradation in the other parameters of the cell, neither in the initial nor in the stabilized state. Finally, by implementing this process in a-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem solar cells we obtained an initial efficiency of 10.3% (Voc=1.76V, FF=74.5%, Jsc=7.8mAcm−2); light soaking test resulted in a stabilized efficiency of 8.5%.

Abstract: The anti-recombination property and the surface area of TiO2 influence the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The effects of various over-layers and O2 plasma treatment on TiO2 electrodes have been investigated. Over-layers were coated by dip coating in a solution of saturated Ba(NO3)2, Mg(NO3)2 and N2O6Sr, which reduced the recombination of electrons from the photo excited state of Ru dye. O2 plasma treatment was applied to improve both the contact ability with the dye and the electron takeover capability by reducing oxygen vacancies on both the TiO2 and the over-layer surface. The photo conversion efficiency of DSSC was improved by both over-layer coating and O2 plasma treatment. In particular, dipping in saturated Ba(NO3)2 solution and O2 plasma treatment (BP), the photo conversion efficiency was greatly improved from 5.27% to 6.76%. The reason was that the over-layers and O2 plasma treatment decreased electron recombination. The energy barrier of the modified over-layers blocks the electron transfer from TiO2 to the electrolyte, and consequently increases electron density by extending the electron lifetime. O2 plasma treatment also increased the Ru dye absorption.

Abstract: Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a neurodegenerative mycotoxin produced by Fusarium verticiloides mould that contaminates maize worldwide. FB1 toxicity has been connected with deregulation of sphingolipid metabolism, but the mechanism of cytotoxicity remains controversial. In cell cultures of rat primary astrocytes and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), we found that FB1 inhibits mitochondrial complex I, which leads to a decrease in the rate of mitochondrial and cellular respiration, depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane, induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria and deregulation of calcium signalling. Despite the increase in ROS production, the intracellular level of glutathione (GSH) was significantly increased. After 24h of FB1 exposure, no cell death was observed. Thus, mitochondria appear to be the primary target of FB1, which leads to sustained deregulation of calcium homeostasis and presumably to cell death.

Segregation of open Major Histocompatibility Class I conformers at the plasma membrane and during endosomal trafficking reveals conformation-based sorting in the endosomal system,

Abstract: Fully conformed Major Histocompatibility Class I molecules are complexes of heavy chain non-covalently associated with the peptide and beta-2-microglobulin. Conformational change in the extracellular domain of heavy chain leads to their disassembly and formation of open conformers, a process that physiologically occurs in normal cells and results in their presence at the cell surface. In this study we characterized endosomal trafficking of open conformers of a murine class I allele in order to examine whether conformational change in the extracellular domain of a membrane glycoprotein determines its endosomal sorting. Open conformers segregated from their fully conformed counterparts at the plasma membrane and in endosomes by sequestration in lipid-organized membrane environment. Consequently, open conformers constitutively internalized via distinct clathrin-independent endocytic carriers and converged into “classical” early endosomes together with transferrin receptor and cholera-toxin B subunit. In early endosomes, open conformers were excluded from recycling and diverted towards late endosomes. Due to lack of recycling, open conformers were constitutively internalized at a higher rate than full conformed proteins. Concanamycin A, methyl-β-cyclodextrin and sphingomyelinase treatment prevented segregation of open conformers in vacuolar early endosomes indicating that acidic endosomal environment and membrane composition are critical for the maintenance of the sorting mechanism. In the absence of endosomal acidification open conformers partitioned into lipid disordered membrane composition of early endosomes. Thus, our data suggest for the existence of a lipid-dependent mechanism in the endosomal system that distinguish membrane proteins based on conformation of their extracellular domain.

Abstract: We investigate Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin films grown in multi-stage coevaporation processes and solar cells fabricated from such absorbers. Despite some interdiffusion during film growth, Ga/(Ga+In) gradients defined via evaporation-profile variations in the process are to a good part retained in the finished film. This indicates that the bandgap can be engineered in this type of process by varying the evaporation profiles, and consequently also that unintended profile variations should be noted and avoided. With front-side gradients the topmost part of many grains seems to be affected by a higher density of lattice defects due to the strong change of gallium content under copper-poor growth conditions. Electrically, both back-side gradients and moderate front-side gradients are shown to yield an improvement of device efficiency. If a front-side gradient is too wide, though, it causes strong voltage-dependent collection and the fill factor is severely reduced.

Abstract: Cu(InxGa1−x)Se2 (CIGS) thin films were prepared by selenization of CuInGa single-layer metallic precursors. At the first stage, CuInGa metallic precursors were deposited onto soda lime glass by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering system using a CuInGa ternary alloy target with a composition ratio of Cu:In:Ga of 1:0.7:0.3. The precursor films were reacted with Se vapor in vacuum evaporation system. By means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), it was found that CIGS thin films exhibit large facetted grains and single chalcopyrite phase with preferred orientation along (112) plane. Meanwhile, the surface roughness of the CIGS films can be determined by the morphology of the precursor films.

Abstract: We synthesized the thiophene-based copolymers (P(3TAF-co-3TAa)-A-n and P(3TAF-co-3TAa)-B-n) using two different kinds of thiophene monomers, (N-(3-thienylmethylene)-2-aminofluorene and 3-thiophene acetic acid), as sensitizers on the DSSCs. P(3TAF-co-3TAa)-A-n (n=1, 2, 3) was synthesized with different molar ratios (3TAF:3TAa=1:5, 1:10, 1:20) of monomers at room temperature, respectively. Also, P(3TAF-co-3TAa)-B-n (n=1, 2, 3) was synthesized with above molar ratios of monomers at 0°C, respectively. The DSSCs devices were fabricated using the thiophene-based copolymers as sensitizers and their photovoltaic performances were measured by using a solar simulator under AM 1.5. In the DSSCs devices using polymeric sensitizers, Voc is 0.53–0.60V, Jsc is 1.9–4.5mA/cm2, FF is 0.51–0.63 and the power conversion efficiency is 0.63–1.53%, respectively.

Abstract: The modification of the conductivity as well as the nanoscale morphology and electrostatic properties of poly-3-octyl-thiophene (P3OT) thin films have been studied as these films are irradiated by ultraviolet light (UV). Films of about 100nm thickness were prepared by spin-coating a P3OT solution in toluene on glass substrates. The samples were characterized by electronic transport measurements and non-contact scanning force microscopy (NC-SFM) for every cycle of UV radiation. Nanoscale topographic and electrostatic characterization using NC-SFM were performed on the same location using a specially designed sample holder. A two stage degradation process has been observed, the first one presents a chemical modification of the polymer (decoloration of sample) and free carrier mobility reduction, the second one is characterized by a strong structural modification, thickness reduction, oxygen doping and further mobility reduction. The comparison of these results on P3OT with other studies performed on P3HT will allow for a detailed analysis of the role of side-chains in the degradation mechanism upon UV irradiation.

Abstract: We carried out the experiments which show unambiguously that not one, as it was commonly accepted, but three optical absorption bands corresponding to different color centers arise in the nanosized MoO3 films due to hydrogen atoms. Varying the conditions for the photoinjection of hydrogen into the MoO3 films, it is possible to change drastically the correlation between the concentrations of different arising centers, which in turn yields the great difference in the optical absorption spectra. Our findings are crucial for understanding of the nature of electrochromism and photochromism not only in MoO3 films but also in the series of the transition metal oxide films.

Abstract: FeIII supported on ceria as an effective catalyst for oxidation was prepared and used for the degradation of basic orange 2 azo textile dye (BO2). BO2 was chosen as a model pollutant and the catalytic oxidation was carried out in a batch reactor using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant at pH 3. The influent factors on BO2 oxidation, such as catalyst dosage, H2O2 concentration, and BO2 concentration were studied by considering the BO2 conversion and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. The FeIII–ceria catalyst showed a high catalytic activity for the oxidation of BO2 in aqueous solution. It was observed that the solution became colorless after 5h of oxidation and over 90% COD removal was achieved with all the FeIII–ceria catalysts used under dark conditions in the catalytic oxidation system. The catalytic removal of BO2 during BO2 oxidation was improved under solar radiation, which notably increased the BO2 degradation rate. Consecutive BO2 oxidation cycles carried out with the same FeIII–ceria catalyst and untreated fresh dyestuff solution showed that the catalyst had good stability and good degradation performance, thus evidencing the possibility of being used in continuous processes. This study showed that the FeIII–ceria catalytic oxidation process is an efficient method for the treatment of BO2 aqueous solutions.

Abstract: UV photo-crosslinkable polymer electrolytes based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) were used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). PEG and bifunctional PEGDA formed a crosslinked structure upon UV light illumination, confirmed by the solubility test and FTIR spectroscopy. The polymeric electrolyte was prepared by photo-polymerization after injecting the monomer electrolyte solution into the porous film in order to make close contact with the TiO2 porous film. Under AM 1.5 (100mW/cm2) light irradiation for up to 20min, a maximum 62% increase in the photo-conversion efficiency (η%) was observed. The DSSCs with the crosslinkable PEG/PEGDA based polymer electrolyte showed improved long-term stability in comparison to those with electrolytes containing only PEG. Also, the effects of solvent on stability of the DSSCs were investigated.

Abstract: A building integrated photovoltaic system as a shading device is used as an application and remodeling model. This study applies the simulation program SOLCEL and the computational fluid dynamics method to cases with solar irradiance components analysis and a ventilated double façade remodeling of the BIPV. For the validation of the theoretical work, experimental results of the Samsung Institute of Engineering and Construction Company building are used with a wind velocity of the weather data of Suwon area, Korea, where the real building is located. A photovoltaic system can be used only to generate electricity, but if a photovoltaic module can be used as an element of a double envelope, it could be more useful at the point of view of renewable energy usage and night insulation. Increase of PV module surface temperature is negative for power generation by installing PV module as an element of double envelope. A reasonable combination between renewable energy usage and power generation should be well analyzed for better usage of natural energy to design a BIPV.

Abstract: Induction melting process using segmented graphite crucible was investigated to melt silicon feedstock for solar cells. Induction melting is the key technology used in silicon melting process, such as ingot-growing, metallurgical refining and ribbon production. However, contamination of silicon from the crucible in induction melting is the main source of degrading the silicon. In this paper, new structure of crucible was suggested to minimize the contamination from the crucible wall. It was the segmentation of graphite crucible wall that introduced the non-contact between melt and inner wall of crucible. Numerical and experimental studies of induction melting process of silicon using the suggested crucible were conducted. For numerical analysis, 3D models of crucible, induction coil and silicon were constructed and electromagnetic force and temperature distribution in silicon and crucible were calculated. To evaluate a process with the suggested crucible, induction melting system was built up based on the simulated results and experiments of silicon melting were carried out.

Abstract: We derive and apply a model that determines the effective minority carrier lifetime of macroporous crystalline silicon samples as a function of bulk lifetime, surface passivation and pore morphology. Two cases are considered: A layer of periodic macropores at the surface of a silicon wafer and a free standing macroporous silicon layer. We compare the model with experimental lifetime measurements for samples with randomly positioned macropores with a length of 10–40μm. The pores have an average pore diameter of 2.4μm and an average pore distance of 5.2μm. The surface is passivated by thermal oxidation. The model agrees with the measurements if we assume an average surface recombination velocity S=24cm/s at the pore surface.

Abstract: Outdoor performance of photovoltaic (PV) modules primarily depends on the instantaneous plane-of-array irradiance (Gpoa) and PV module temperature (Tpv). Tpv can be estimated from the ambient temperature (Tamb) and the Gpoa as Tpv=Tamb+kTGpoa. The coefficient kT depends strongly on the way the PV module is mounted (open rack, ventilated or unventilated roof mounting, etc.), wind speed and also on the module type. In the presented paper, open rack mounted and unventilated roof integrated cases of PV module installation are experimentally and theoretically examined. Linear relationship with kT is upgraded with a nonlinear one based on the energy balance model and measured data. Nevertheless, Tpv is also affected by the module’s regime of operation. The Tpv dependency on different regime of operation (open-circuit and maximum power point tracking) for two types of PV modules in two regimes is reported. Differences are discussed in light of energy balance equation within thermal management, where impact of the PV module conversion efficiency on Tpv is also shown.

Abstract: Efficient hole collection in polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been achieved by introducing an ultra-thin UV–ozone (UVO) treated Au on indium tin oxide (ITO) to substitute poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Through optimizing the Au thickness and the duration of UVO treatment, it is shown that the ITO/Au (1nm) treated by UVO for 15s improves the fill factor significantly to 67.2% and power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 3.47%, which is competitive to that of the PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs with PCE of 3.38%. The results of ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy and the analysis of the current conduction mechanism show that the UVO-treated Au offers favorable band alignment at metal/polymer interface of the anode for efficient hole collection. Meanwhile, the series resistance of the device decreases drastically.

Abstract: Using Al added Mo back electrode to provide Al source to form CuInAlSe2 (CIAS) absorber with self-formed double graded bandgap (or Al concentration) is reported. The double Al grading is self-forming and requires no process tweaking or modification. A 15at % Al in Mo(Al) film yielded 0.39 Al/(In+Al) ratio in the CIAS film with a bandgap of 1.54eV at the surface. The benefits of doping Al into Mo film are: lower resistance of the Mo layer, improved Mo to glass adhesion, increased surface electric field or improved minority carrier collection from the graded Al content (graded bandgap), and supply Al to form a CIAS absorber layer.

Abstract: We have developed a new minority-carrier lifetime measurement apparatus for measuring the recombination lifetime in semiconductors. We describe the technique as transmission modulated photoconductive decay (TMPCD). This is a contactless, non-invasive technique that produces transient photoconductive lifetime data. The measurement procedure is very sensitive to small signals and has a superior time response for measurement of short carrier lifetimes. This technology has several advantages over resonant coupled photoconductive decay (RCPCD) and transient microwave reflection photoconductive decay (μPCD). The response time advantage provides a capability to measure very short lifetimes in thin film materials, such as nanocrystalline silicon films and nanowire composites. This is accomplished while maintaining a sensitivity that is at least comparable to RCPCD. The new technique has been successfully applied to silicon wafers, compound semiconductor thin films, nano-crystalline silicon films, and II–VI nanowires.

Wide bandgap hydrogenated amorphous silicon oxide (a-SiO:H) film was used as an absorber layer of top cell in order to obtain solar cells with high open circuit voltage (Voc), which are attractive for the use in high temperature environment. All p, i and n layers were deposited on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coated glass substrate by a 60MHz-very-high-frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (VHF–PECVD) technique. The p–i–n–p–i–n double-junction solar cells were fabricated by varying the CO2 and H2 flow rate of i top layer in order to obtain the wide bandgap with good quality material, which deposited near the phase boundary between a-SiO:H and hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon oxide (μc-SiO:H), where the high Voc can be expected. The typical a-SiO:H/μc-Si:H solar cell showed the highest initial cell efficiency of 10.5%. The temperature coefficient (TC) of solar cells indicated that the values of TC for conversion efficiency (η) of the double-junction solar cells were inversely proportional to the initial Voc, which corresponds to the bandgap of the top cells. The TC for η of typical a-SiO:H/μc-Si:H was −0.32%/°C, lower than the value of conventional a-Si:H/μc-Si:H solar cell. Both the a-SiO:H/μc-Si:H solar cell and the conventional solar cell showed the same light induced degradation ratio of about 20%. We concluded that the solar cells using wide bandgap a-SiO:H film in the top cells are promising for the use in high temperature regions.

Abstract: The nanoscale morphology of the active layer in organic, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is crucial to device performance. Often a combination of casting conditions and post deposition thermal treatment is used to optimize the morphology. In general, the development of microscopic crystals is deleterious, as the exciton diffusion length is ≈10nm. We find that the microscopic crystallization behavior in polythiophene/fullerene blends is strongly influenced by the substrate on which the BHJ is cast. With a silicon oxide substrate, the crystal nucleation density is high and significant crystallization occurs at a temperature of 140°C. On more hydrophobic substrates, significantly higher temperatures are required for observable crystallization. This difference is attributed to the interfacial segregation of the PCBM, controlled by the substrate surface energy. The substrate dependence of crystallization has significant implications on the fullerene crystal growth mechanisms and practical implications for device studies.

Abstract: The temperature dependence of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells fabricated from poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was studied in detail. Individual materials as well as blends and solar cell devices were examined. Light absorption, photoluminescence, quantum efficiency, total efficiency, and current–voltage characteristics were studied from temperatures −10 to 140°C. A method and apparatus for testing these parameters at various temperatures is described. Parameters were measured for both unannealed and annealed samples to give insight into the annealing process. It was found that absorption and photoluminescence of devices shift both position and intensity with varying temperatures. Quantum efficiency and total efficiency were monitored as they increased with annealing. Once annealed, device efficiency peaked at temperatures from 10 to 60°C because of competing temperature dependent effects of the materials. The temperature dependence study provides valuable information on device properties and thermal annealing.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a multi-crystalline solar cell with hexagonally aligned hemispherical concaves, which is known as honeycomb textured structure, for an anti-reflecting structure. The emitter and the rear surface were passivated by silicon nitride, which is known as passivated emitter and rear (PERC) structure. The texture was fabricated by laser-patterning of silicon nitride film on a wafer and wet chemical etching of the wafer beneath the silicon nitride film through the patterned holes. This process succeeded in substituting the lithographic process usually used for fabricating honeycomb textured structure in small area. After the texturing process, solar cells were fabricated by utilizing conventional fabrication techniques, i.e. phosphorus diffusion in tube furnace, deposition of anti-reflection film and rear passivation film by chemical vapor deposition, front and rear electrodes formation by screen printing, and contact formation by furnace. By adding relatively small complicating process to conventional production process, conversion efficiency of 19.1% was achieved with mc-Si solar cells of over 200cm2 in size. The efficiency was independently confirmed by National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).

Abstract: We reported the synthesis of novel polymeric semiconductor materials based on [poly(4-(5-(1,5-bis(alkoxy)naphthalen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole)] (PANTBT) and the fabrication of solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 4.2% using the synthesized polymers blended with [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) in bulk heterojunction geometry. By varying the side chains, three polymers were synthesized [poly(4-(5-(1,5-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphthalen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PENTBT), [poly(4-(5-(1,5-bis(decyloxy)naphthalen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PDNTBT), and [poly(4-(5-(1,5-bis(tetradecyloxy)naphthalen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PTDNTBT), maintaining a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and relatively low band gap, which lead to a high open circuit voltage and short circuit current of the resulting devices. Due to the superior miscibility of PANTBT derivatives with PC70BM, favorable phase separation with a domain size of 10–20nm was achieved regardless of the crystalline nature of the pristine polymers. PDNTBT with alkyl side chain C10 and PTDNTBT with alkyl side chain C14 showed higher photovoltaic performances. In addition, the effects of the crystalline nature of polymers on the thermal stability of the resulting solar cell devices were discussed in terms of the influence of side chains.

Abstract: IQGAP1 is a plasma membrane-associated protein and an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to cell migration, polarity and adhesion. In this study, we demonstrate the nuclear translocation of IQGAP1 using confocal microscopy and cell fractionation. Moreover, we identify a specific pool of IQGAP1 that accumulates in the nucleus during late G1-early S phase of the cell cycle. The nuclear targeting of IQGAP1 was facilitated by N- and C-terminal sequences, and its ability to slowly shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm/membrane was partly regulated by the CRM1 export receptor. The inhibition of GSK-3β also stimulated nuclear localization of IQGAP1. The dramatic nuclear accumulation of IQGAP1 observed when cells were arrested in G1/S phase suggested a possible role in cell cycle regulation. In support of this, we used immunoprecipitation assays to show that the nuclear pool of IQGAP1 in G1/S-arrested cells associates with DNA replication complex factors RPA32 and PCNA. More important, the siRNA-mediated silencing of IQGAP1 significantly delayed cell cycle progression through S phase and G2/M in NIH 3T3 cells released from thymidine block. Our findings reveal an unexpected regulatory pathway for IQGAP1, and show that a pool of this cytoskeletal regulator translocates into the nucleus in late G1/early S phase to stimulate DNA replication and progression of the cell cycle.

Abstract: The double carrier pulse deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) technique is used to characterize recombination centers in p-type GaAsN grown by chemical beam epitaxy. The DLTS peak height of a shallow hole trap H1, at 0.052eV from the valence band edge of GaAsN, decreases by the injection of both majority and minority carriers for various values of voltage and duration of the second pulse. Although the trap is shallow, its capture cross section is relatively large to capture electrons and holes. The decrease in the number of traps is explained by the electron–hole recombination process. This confirms, for the first time, that H1 is a recombination center in p-type GaAsN.

Abstract: We herein advance the application of a two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal (PC) as a window layer in an efficient polymer solar cell (PSC). The PSC used here consisted of a photovoltaic (PV) layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene): methanofullerene bulk-heterojunction with a planarized 2D PC window layer made of a hexagonal array of columns of SiO2 nano-rods embedded in a dielectric layer of SiNx. By means of a theoretical simulation of the 2D PCs using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, it was shown that the path length of the incident light can be increased with a large deflection angle. The experimental results confirmed the simulated results obtained using the 2D PC layer. Furthermore, it was shown that a relative increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 25% was achieved for the PSC with the 2D PC layer, indicating that this layer induces further photon absorption due to efficient light-harvesting within the PV layer.

Abstract: Metabolomics, the study of metabolites and small intermediate molecules, may play a key role in further elucidation of breast cancer. This dynamic, simultaneous assessment of thousands of metabolites allows identification of the presence, concentration and fluxes of specific metabolites, and recognition of the critical metabolic pathways recruited in carcinogenesis. Studies of tumour cell and tissue allow focused analysis on the tumour, whilst studies of biofluids have the appeal of concurrent assessment of tumour and host. Elucidation of these metabolites and pathways may provide essential insights into both the intercellular environment and host/tumour interaction, allowing recognition of new biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of outcome, new therapy targets and novel approaches for monitoring response and toxicity. Certainly, the field of metabolomics may evolve as a valuable, complementary clinical tool. In this review, current metabolomic data in breast cancer will be presented. The dominant metabolic pathways and metabolite disturbances associated with malignant transformation of breast cells will be outlined, leading to an overview of potential clinical implications for individuals with breast cancer.

Abstract: Podoplanin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is upregulated in cancer and was reported to induce an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MDCK cells. The promotion of EMT was dependent on podoplanin binding to ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) proteins through its cytoplasmic (CT) domain, which led to RhoA-associated kinase (ROCK)-dependent ERM phosphorylation. Using detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) assays, as well as transmembrane (TM) interactions and ganglioside GM1 binding, we present evidence supporting the localization of podoplanin in raft platforms important for cell signalling. Podoplanin mutant constructs harbouring a heterologous TM region or lacking the CT tail were unable to associate with DRMs, stimulate ERM phosphorylation and promote EMT or cell migration. Similar effects were observed upon disruption of a GXXXG motif within the TM domain, which is involved in podoplanin self-assembly. In contrast, deletion of the extracellular (EC) domain did not affect podoplanin DRM association. Together, these data suggest that both the CT and TM domains are required for podoplanin localization in raft platforms, and that this association appears to be necessary for podoplanin-mediated EMT and cell migration.

Abstract: Multistage evaporation processes are capable of producing state of the art Cu(In,Ga)Se2-thin-films for use in solar cells. The morphology of films grown by this process changes in a rapid manner as soon as their composition becomes copper rich beyond stoichiometry. For investigation of the structural changes, synchrotron radiation energy-dispersive X-ray diffractometry was used. Cu-rich and Cu-poor absorbers with an in-depth gallium gradient were grown by physical vapor deposition. These were transferred to a thermal processing reaction chamber which allows in-situ characterization. In the Cu-rich case changes in energy and shape of the measured diffraction signals caused by heating the samples could be attributed to the leveling of indium and gallium gradients within the layer. As a secondary method glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy was used to confirm this result. Cu-poor reference samples did not show a similarly significant intermixing of indium and gallium during annealing. We conclude, that the presence of excess copper in the layer at elevated temperatures (>470∘C) causes interdiffusion of indium and gallium.

Abstract: Plexin-B1, the receptor for Sema4D, has been reported to trigger multiple and sometimes opposing cellular responses in various types of tumor cells. It has been implicated in the regulation of tumor-cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. However, the plexin-B1 gene expression and its regulatory mechanism in cervical cancer remain unclear. The present study shows that plexin-B1 is over-expressed in cervical tumor tissues compared to normal cervical tissues by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of plexin-B1 is significantly associated with cervical tumor metastasis and invasion according to the analysis of the clinicopathologic data. Plexin-B1 also promotes proliferation, migration and invasion in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. We also found that the plexin-B1 levels are inversely correlated with miR-214 amounts in both cervical cancer tissues and HeLa cells. And miR-214 expression level is also associated with metastasis and invasion of cervical tumor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that plexin-B1 is inhibited by miR-214 through a miR-214 binding site within the 3′UTR of plexin-B1 in HeLa cells. Ectopic expression of miR-214 could inhibit the proliferation capacity, migration and invasion ability of HeLa cells. Our findings suggest that plexin-B1, a target of miR-214, may function as an oncogene in human cervical cancer HeLa cells.

Abstract: Amyloid-like fibrils have been associated with the pathogenesis of human prion diseases. Prion peptide of aa 106–126 (PrP106–126) exhibits many PrPSc-like biochemical features, forming amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. Here, we found that the recombinant yeast-derived molecular chaperon Hsp104 inhibited significantly the fibril assembly of the synthetic PrP106–126 peptide by dynamic ThT assays in vitro. EM assays revealed almost no fibril-like structure after incubation of the synthetic PrP106–126 peptides with Hsp104 for 12h. Circular dichroism assays identified that treatment of Hsp104 shifted the secondary structure of PrP106–126 fibrils from β-sheet to a random coil. MTT tests confirmed that interaction of PrP106–126 with Hsp104 maintained the toxicity of PrP106–126 on human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. Additionally, Hsp104 was able to disassemble the mature PrP106–126 fibrils in vitro, leading to recovering the cytotoxicity of PrP106–126 on SK-N-SH cells. Our study provides the molecular evidences that the yeast-derived Hsp104 can interfere in the fibril assembly and disassembly of human PrP106–126 segment.

Abstract: The ability of magnetic fields (MFs) to promote/increase Ca2+ influx into cells is widely recognized, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here we analyze how static MFs of 6mT modulates thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ movements in non-excitable U937 monocytes, and how this relates to the anti-apoptotic effect of MFs. Magnetic fields do not affect thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ mobilization from endoplasmic reticulum, but significantly increase the resulting Ca2+ influx; this increase requires intracellular signal transduction actors including G protein, phospholipase C, diacylglycerol lipase and nitric oxide synthase, and behaves as a non-capacitative Ca2+ entry (NCCE), a type of influx with an inherent signaling function, rather than a capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE). All treatments abrogating the extra Ca2+ influx also abrogate the anti-apoptotic effect of MFs, demonstrating that MF-induced NCCE elicits an anti-apoptotic survival pathway.

Abstract: A controlled atmosphere setup designed for long-term degradation studies of organic solar cells under illumination is presented. The setup was designed with ease-of-use and compactness in mind and allows for multiple solar cells distributed on four glass substrates to be studied in four different chambers with temperature and atmosphere control. The four chambers are situated at close proximity in the setup thereby allowing the solar cells to be subjected to as uniform an illumination distribution as possible for the given solar simulator employed. The cell substrates serve as the front window and present a tight seal. Hence no illumination correction needs to be performed due to transmission and reflection losses as otherwise seen with test chambers employing a window as a seal. The solar cells in each chamber are continuously and individually electrically monitored under biased conditions by means of a computer controlled multiplexer and source meter. The dimensions of the setup allow it to pass through a mid-size load lock in most common glove box systems allowing for mounting of tested samples under inert conditions. As a demonstration of the applicability of the chamber design, a degradation study of standard P3HT:PCBM solar cells was performed under four different environmental conditions.

Abstract: Because of increase in demand for clean energy sources, photovoltaic device is becoming more important as a new power plant. To replace fossil fuels with photovoltaics, generating electricity with solar cells should meet cost effectiveness and high efficiency. An anti-reflection technique is one of the effective methods to achieve high efficiency. To reduce the reflection at the surface of concentrated photovoltaic device, a nanometer scale dot-pattern array was formed on the surface of GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge solar cells by nano-imprint lithography. Since this nano-pattern is smaller than the wavelength of visible light, the effective refractive index near the surface changes gradually. Thus, the reflection of the light at the surface with moth-eye structure can be effectively reduced for overall spectral region. As a result, a solar cell with the moth-eye pattern as an anti-reflection layer showed lower reflectance and enhanced total conversion efficiency, compared to a solar cell without a moth-eye patterned layer. The patterned solar cell was characterized using UV–vis spectrophotometer, atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), and its total conversion efficiency was measured by solar simulator.

Abstract: The performance of printable metal back electrodes for polymer solar cells were investigated using light beam induced current (LBIC) mapping of the final solar cell device after preparation to identify the causes of poor performance. Three different types of silver based printable metal inks were employed. Organic solvent based, UV-curable and water based silver inks were tested. Both grid electrodes and full electrodes were employed and it was shown via the grid electrode that the organic solvent based ink adversely affects the device performance under the printed metal whereas both the UV-curable and the water based inks were neutral to improving device performance. Complete roll-to-roll (R2R) processed modules were also tested and some limitations of the LBIC technique was identified for serially connected modules.

Abstract: Recent years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of normal configuration organic solar cells (OSCs) has obtained rapid progress to reach more than 6% under standard illumination, which is reasonable value for the commercial criterion. More and more research attention has been paid on the stability and lifetime of OSCs. A novel structural OSCs with high work function metal or metal oxide as the top electrode and low work function metal as the bottom anode is proposed and named as inverted configuration OSCs. The inverted configuration OSCs with high work function metal as top cathode could improve OSCs's lifetime, i.e., protecting cells from the damage by oxygen and moisture in air. Furthermore, the inverted configuration OSCs is the appealing alternative to the conventional regular structure due to the inherent vertical phase separation in the polymer active layers and high stability or long device lifetime. The inverted configuration OSCs have not only achieved an impressive PCE of 4.4%, but also exhibited an exceptional device lifetime without encapsulation. In this review article, the recent developments and vital researches on the inverted configuration OSCs are summarized.

Abstract: The influence of Se beam pressure on defect properties in Cu(In1–x,Gax)Se2 (CIGS)-based solar cells fabricated by the three-stage process was investigated by admittance spectroscopy. The Se beam pressure was varied from 1.3×10−3 to 4.4×10−3Pa, at the position of the samples, by varying the Se cell temperature. The spectra for all samples show three distinct peaks denoted as α, β, and ζ with activation energies of 20, 150, and 300meV, respectively. The trap density of ζ increased from 5×1014 to 4×1015cm−3 with decrease in Se beam pressure; the trap densities of α and β did not change. These results suggest that the origin of ζ is related to the Se deficiency. The density of ζ seems to correlate with the cell efficiency. Therefore, it is important to control the Se beam pressure in order to obtain highly efficient solar cells.

Abstract: Misfolded human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) in pancreatic islets is associated with the loss of insulin-secreting beta cells in type 2 diabetes. Insulin secretion impairment and cell apoptosis can be due to mitochondrial dysfunction in pancreatic beta cells. Currently, there is little information about the effect of hIAPP on mitochondrial function. In this study, we used INS-1E rat insulinoma beta cells as a model to investigate the role of mitochondria in hIAPP-induced apoptosis and the protective effects of phycocyanin (PC). We demonstrated that hIAPP induced apoptosis in INS-1E cells was associated with the disruption of mitochondrial function, as evidenced by ATP depletion, mitochondrial mass reduction, mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Further molecular analysis showed that hIAPP induced changes in the expression of Bcl-2 family members, release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria into cytosol, activation of caspases and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Interestingly, the hIAPP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in INS-1E cells was effectively restored by co-treatment of PC. Moreover, there was crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways as demonstrated by cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 in the apoptotic process triggered by hIAPP. Taken together, we demonstrated for the first time the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in hIAPP-induced INS-1E cell apoptosis. Attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction provides a mechanism for the protective effects of PC.

Abstract: A detailed parametric study of the influence of silver nanospheres on the optical absorption of a poly [2-méthoxy-5-(2-éthyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phénylène–vinylène]: 6,6-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (MEH-PPV:PCBM) bulk heterojunction is performed via a numerical analysis based on the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) rigorous method. The metallic nanoparticles are placed inside this interpenetrated organic layer while a 50nm-thick organic layer without particles is juxtaposed. We investigate the role of critical parameters such as period, diameter and position of nanospheres in enhancing absorption in MEH-PPV:PCBM when they are placed either in the front area directly exposed to light or in the back area. We calculate intrinsic absorption in the whole active bi-layer after subtracting the intrinsic absorption inside particles. A greater increase in absorption (up to 3) is observed for structures with nanospheres than for structures without nanospheres. Furthermore, absorption of a 150nm-thick active layer including nanoparticles is stronger than that of a 330nm-thick active layer without nanoparticles. This absorption enhancement is due to the localized plasmon polariton and scattering. The calculated absorption spectra in this paper could give useful data for further manufacturing of efficient solar cells.

Abstract: We report GaAs-based quantum dot (QD) solar cells fabricated by the intermittent deposition of InGaAs using molecular beam epitaxy. We obtained a highly stacked and well-aligned InGaAs QD structure of over 30 layers without using a strain compensation technique by the intermittent deposition of InGaAs layers. Moreover, there was no degradation in crystal quality. The external quantum efficiency of multi-stacked InGaAs QD solar cells extends the photo-absorption spectra toward a wavelength longer than the GaAs band gap, and the quantum efficiency increases as the number of stacking layers increases. The performance of the QD solar cells indicates that the novel InGaAs QDs facilitate the fabrication of highly stacked QD layers that are suitable for solar cell devices requiring thick QD layers for sufficient light absorption.

Abstract: Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 thin films with high Ga/III ratio (around 0.8) were prepared by sequential evaporation from CuGaSe2, CuInSe2, In2Se3 and Ga2Se3 compounds and then annealing in H2S gas atmosphere. The annealing temperature was varied from 400 to 500°C. These samples were characterized by means of XRF, EPMA, XRD and SEM. The S/(S+Se) mole ratio in the thin films increased with increase in the annealing temperature, keeping the Cu, In and Ga contents nearly constant. The open circuit voltage increased and the short circuit current density decreased with increase in the annealing temperature. The best solar cell using Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 thin film with Ga/(In+Ga)=0.79 and S/(S+Se)=0.11 annealed at 400°C demonstrated Voc=535mV, Isc=13.3mA/cm2, FF=0.61 and efficiency=4.34% without AR-coating.

Transgenic overexpression of HSP56 does not result in cardiac hypertrophy nor protect from ischaemia/reperfusion injury,

Abstract: Heat shock proteins are known to be induced during and following different forms of cardiac stress. It has previously been shown that their expression is beneficial for the heart following trauma such as ischaemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury. Heat shock protein 56 (HSP56) belongs to the family of FK506-binding immunophilin proteins and is found in steroid receptor complexes, notably the glucocorticoid receptor. We have previously shown that HSP56 and other HSPs are induced in cardiac myocytes treated with cardiotrophin-1, a cytokine with potent hypertrophic and protective properties on cardiac cells. The hypertrophic action of cardiotrophin-1 on cardiac cells is dependent on HSP56 induction and overexpression of HSP56 is sufficient for inducing hypertrophy in cardiac cells. To investigate this phenomenon in vivo, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing HSP56 and assessed them for the development cardiac hypertrophy and resistance of their hearts to I/R-injury by Langendorff perfusion. Mice generated demonstrated stable, yet varying expression levels of HSP56. Initial characterisation identified a sex-specific phenotype where male overexpressing mice exhibited a moderate, but significant, reduced body weight compared to wild-type controls. In ex vivo stress analyses we found, unexpectedly, that significant overexpression of HSP56 does not induce myocardial hypertrophy and nor does it protect the intact heart from I/R-injury. These observations now suggest a more intricate HSP56-Sp. Cardiophenotype that requires further studies to determine if HSP56 is necessary in mediating hypertrophy induced by other myocardial stimuli.

Abstract: Surface texturing of crystalline silicon wafer improves the conversion efficiency of solar cells by the enhancement in antireflection property and light trapping. Compared to antireflection coating, it is a more permanent and effective scheme. Wet texturing with the chemicals such as alkali (NaOH, KOH) or acid (HF, HNO3, CH3COOH) is too difficult for thinner wafer to apply due to a large amount of silicon loss. However, Plasma surface texturing using Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) can be effective in reducing the surface reflectance with low silicon loss. In this study, we have fabricated a large-area (156×156mm) multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cell by mask less surface texturing using a SF6/O2 reactive ion etching. We have accomplished texturing with RIE by reducing silicon loss by almost half of that in wet texturing process. By optimizing the processing steps, we achieved conversion efficiency, open circuit voltage, short circuit current density, and fill factor as high as 16.1%, 619mV, 33.5mA/cm2, and 77.7%, respectively. This study establishes that it is possible to fabricate the thin multicrystalline silicon solar cells of low cost and high efficiency using surface texturing by RIE.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence that p38 MAPK, which is classified as a stress-activated kinase, also participates in cell cycle regulation, functioning as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We conducted a study of p38 MAPK phosphorylation during liver regeneration in mice to determine whether p38 MAPK activation or inactivation may correlate with events that lead to DNA replication after partial hepatectomy (PH), and whether p38 MAPK activation may be required for hepatocyte DNA replication in vivo and in culture. We report that active p38 (Pi-p38 MAPK) is present in normal liver, is rapidly inactivated starting 30min after PH, and is re-activated by 12h. Although levels of Pi-MKK 3/6, the upstream kinases that activate p38 MAPK increase after PH, the expression of the dual protein phosphatase 1 is also elevated, and may be responsible for Pi-p38 MAPK dephosphorylation after PH. Inactivation and re-activation of p38 MAPK inversely correlates with the stimulation of protein synthesis and translation pathways, as indicated by activation of p70S6 kinase, increases in the phosphorylation of initiation factor elF-4E and translational repressor, 4E-BP. The activity of a p38 MAPK downstream substrate, MAPKAPK2 (MK2), did not reflect the changing levels of Pi-p38 MAPK during liver regeneration. Pi-p38 MAPK may be involved in TNF-stimulated DNA replication of murine hepatocytes in culture, but is not necessary for hepatocyte DNA replication after PH. Our results suggest that p38 MAPK inactivation plays a permissible role in DNA replication during liver regeneration and is consistent with a role for p38 MAPK in the maintenance of hepatocyte cell cycle arrest in adult liver.

Abstract: We have investigated the effect of high-pressure pure hydrogen annealing (HPHA) for upgraded metallurgical grade (UMG)-silicon solar cell in order to obtain cost-effective high-efficiency cell using post-metallization anneal at a relatively low temperature. We have observed that high-pressure pure hydrogen annealing effectively passivated the defects and improved the minority carrier lifetime, series resistance and conversion efficiency. It can be attributed to significantly improved hydrogenation in high-pressure pure hydrogen process. This improvement can be explained by the enhanced hydrogenation of silicon solar cell with antireflection layer due to hydrogen re-incorporation. The results of this experiment represent a promising guideline for improving the high-efficiency solar cells by introducing an easy and low cost process of post-hydrogenation in optimized condition.

Abstract: The overall demand to reduce solar energy costs gives a continuous drive to reduce the thickness of silicon wafers. Handling and bowing problems associated with thinner wafers become more and more important, as these can lead to cells cracking and thus to high yield losses. In this paper the microstructure and mechanical properties of the aluminum on the rear side of a solar cell are discussed. It is shown that the aluminum back contact has a complex composite-like microstructure, consisting of five main components: (1) the back surface field layer; (2) a eutectic layer; (3) spherical (3–5μm) hypereutectic Al–Si particles surrounded by a thin aluminum oxide layer (200nm); (4) a bismuth–silicate glass matrix; and (5) pores (14 vol%). The Young’s modulus of the Al–Si particles is estimated by nanoindentation and the overall Young’s modulus is estimated on the basis of bowing measurements. These results are used as input parameters for the improved thermomechanical multiscale model of a solar cell.

Abstract: Electrochemical copolymerization of 4,4′-di(N-carbazoyl)biphenyl (CBP) with 2,2′-bithiophene (BT) is carried out in acetonitrile (ACN)/dichloromethane (DCM) (1:1, by volume) solution containing sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) as a supporting electrolyte. Characterizations of the resulting copolymer P(CBP-co-BT) are performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetry (TG). The P(CBP-co-BT) film has distinct electrochromic properties and exhibits four different colors (orange yellow, blue, yellowish green and greenish blue) under various potentials. Maximum contrast (ΔT%) and response time of the copolymer film are measured as 51.6% and 0.94s at 667nm. An electrochromic device (ECD) based on P(CBP-co-BT) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is constructed and characterized. The optical contrast (ΔT%) at 700nm is found to be 28.6% and the response time is measured as 0.47s. The coloration efficiency (CE) of the device is calculated to be 234cm2C−1 at 700nm. An ECD also has good optical memories and redox stability.

Abstract: The origin of process-induced rectification in CdS/ITO and CdS/SnO2 bilayers has been investigated. Both pre-treatment of the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates and post-growth treatment of the bilayers were explored for both oxidising and reducing conditions. In/CdS/TCO structures were used for I–V testing, and the CdS layers were verified as being pinhole-free using a test employing a rectifying Au/CdS contact. Whilst neither pre-oxidation nor reduction of any TCO substrate failed to induce rectification in CdS/TCO, oxidation of CdS always induced rectification, regardless of the substrate type. This was attributed to oxidation of CdS (confirmed by Auger electron spectroscopy), and the results are consistent with a band diagram postulated for the CdO/CdS/ITO structure. Recommendations are made for the fabrication of CdTe/CdS/TCO solar cells.

Abstract: A major role of plasma membrane bound ectonucleotidases is the modulation of ATP, ADP, adenosine (the purinergic agonists), UTP, and UDP (the pyrimidinergic agonists) availability in the extracellular space at their respective receptors. We have recently shown that an ATP driven uridine–UTP cycle is operative in the brain, based on the strictly compartmentalized processes of uridine salvage to UTP and uridine generation from UTP, in which uptaken uridine is anabolized to UTP in the cytosol, and converted back to uridine in the extracellular space by the action of ectonucleotidases (Ipata et al. Int J Biochem Cell Biol 2010;42:932–7). In this paper we show that a similar cytidine–CTP cycle exists in rat brain. Since (i) brain relies on imported preformed nucleosides for the synthesis of nucleotides, RNA, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, coenzymes, pyrimidine sugar- and lipid-conjugates and (ii) no specific pyrimidinergic receptors have been identified for cytidine and their nucleotides, our results, taken together with previous studies on the intra- and extracellular metabolic network of ATP, GTP, UTP, and their nucleosides in the brain (Barsotti and Ipata. Int J Biochem Cell Biol 2004;36:2214–25; Balestri et al. Neurochem Int 2007;50:517–23), strongly suggest that, apart from the modulation of ligand availability, ectonucleotidases may serve the process of local nucleoside recycling in the brain.

Abstract: A relationship between cytotrophoblast differentiation (syncytialisation) and apoptosis is hypothesised to exist, but has not been clearly determined. To address this, we explored the effects of cAMP, an inducer of syncytialisation, on human choriocarcinoma cell differentiation and viability under three different culture conditions related to diverse survival status: no serum, 10% fetal calf serum or 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. 8-Br-cAMP increased BeWo cell viability in culture media without serum, but viability was decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner when serum was present. The appearance of apoptotic nuclei fragments were only observed when BeWo cells were cultured in media containing serum combined with 8-Br-cAMP treatment. In addition, the ratio of FasL to Fas expression following treatment with 8-Br-cAMP increased by 20-fold in 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum media and 65-fold 10% fetal calf serum media, and activation of caspase-3 also required media with serum. The markers of syncytialisation (syncytin 1 expression and human chorionic gonadotropin secretion) were induced significantly by 8-Br-cAMP, and were higher in 10% fetal calf serum media than in 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum media, than in the absence of serum. Syncytia formation was stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP and this required serum in the media. We now show that factors contained within serum are necessary for cAMP-stimulated cytotrophoblast differentiation, that syncytialisation involves apoptotic events, and that a lack of serum based factors could switch the cellular program away from differentiation.

Abstract: The carrier lifetime of crystalline silicon wafers that were passivated with hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiNx:H) films using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition was investigated in order to study the effects of hydrogen plasma pre-treatment on passivation. The decrease in the native oxide, the dangling bonds and the contamination on the silicon wafer led to an increase in the minority carrier lifetime. The silicon wafer was treated using a wet process, and the SiNx:H film was deposited on the back surface. Hydrogen plasma was applied to the front surface of the wafer, and the SiNx:H film was deposited on the hydrogen plasma treated surface using an in-situ process. The SiNx:H film deposition was carried out at a low temperature (<350°C) in a direct plasma reactor operated at 13.6MHz. The surface recombination velocity measurement after the hydrogen plasma pre-treatment and the comparison with the ammonia plasma pre-treatment were made using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements. The passivation qualities were measured using quasi-steady-state photoconductance. The hydrogen atom concentration increased at the SiNx:H/Si interface, and the minority carrier lifetime increased from 36.6 to 75.2μs. The carbon concentration decreased at the SiNx:H/Si interfacial region after the hydrogen plasma pre-treatment.

Abstract: Thickness Insensitive Spectrally Selective (TISS) paint coatings based on black pigment (PK 3060, Ferro Company) dispersed in a fluoropolymeric resin binder (Lumiflon, Asahi Company, Japan) have recently been made without added aluminium flakes and their properties have been reported for the first time. In this study we investigated in more detail the effect of trisilanol isobutyl (IB7 T7(OH)3) polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (trisilanol POSS) on the surface modification of PK 3060 pigment. Infrared spectral analysis of the surface modified pigment particles provided firm evidence for the formation of a POSS layer on the surface of the pigment particles, substantiated by the corresponding TEM and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) measurements of functionalized and as-received pigments. SEM micrographs of the diluted dispersions in fluoropolymeric resin binder revealed uniform distribution of pigment particles with an average size of ∼300nm and the beneficial effect of the pigment functionalization was assessed from the measured spectral selectivity of coatings of various thicknesses.

Abstract: We report the preparation of copper antimony sulfide (CuSbS2) thin films by heating Sb2S3/Cu multilayer in vacuum. Sb2S3 thin film was prepared from a chemical bath containing SbCl3 and Na2S2O3 salts at room temperature (27°C) on well cleaned glass substrates. A copper thin film was deposited on Sb2S3 film by thermal evaporation and Sb2S3/Cu layers were subjected to annealing at different conditions. Structure, morphology, optical and electrical properties of the thin films formed by varying Cu layer thickness and heating conditions were analyzed using different characterization techniques. XRD analysis showed that the thin films formed at 300 and 380°C consist of CuSbS2 with chalcostibite structure. These thin films showed p-type conductivity and the conductivity value increased with increase in copper content. The optical band gap of CuSbS2 was evaluated as nearly 1.5eV.

Abstract: We report fabrication of solar cell (n+–p–p+ structure) on black silicon substrates consisting of silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays prepared by Ag induced wet chemical etching process in aqueous HF–AgNO3 solution. SiNW arrays surface has low reflectivity (<5%) in the entire spectral range (400–1100nm) of interest for solar cells. The solar cells were fabricated by conventional cell fabrication protocol. Performance of three types of cells, namely cell with SiNW over the entire front surface, cell with SiNW only in the active device area and control cell (on planar surface), has been compared. It was found that cell based on selectively grown shorter length SiNW arrays has the best cell performance.

Abstract: Porous silicon (PS) layers were formed on p-type, 〈100〉 oriented, 1–5Ωcm resistivity Cz silicon wafers by electrochemical etching in an HF:C2H5OH (1:2 by volume) electrolyte at room temperature at a constant current density 20mA/cm2. The etching duration was varied to achieve PS layers of different morphologies and thicknesses. Both the photoluminescence (PL) and the total diffused reflectivity spectra of the PS layers were measured. It was found that for the PS layers grown for etching durations of less than 90s the PL emission is insignificant and reflectivity is quite low. Such PS layers can be used as antireflection coatings (ARC) on solar cells. The PS layers formed for etching durations greater than 90s show a significant PL emission in 500–800nm range with peak lying in 630–660nm wavelength range. When etching duration increases from 90s to 8min the PL intensity increases and the PL peak shows a blue shift. With further increase in etching duration the PL intensity decreases and PL peak shows a red shift. The reflectivity of the photoluminescent layers increases with etching duration showing a highest value for a sample grown for 8min. Further increase in etching duration up to 20min the reflectivity decreases and then increases. Striking observation is that both the PL emission intensity and reflectivity in the wavelength range of 550–800nm are maximum for the PS layer grown for the etching duration of 8min.

Abstract: The circadian clock regulates many aspects of physiology, energy metabolism, and sleep. Restricted feeding (RF), a regimen that restricts the duration of food availability entrains the circadian clock. Caffeine has been shown to affect both metabolism and sleep. However, its effect on clock gene and clock-controlled gene expression has not been studied. Here, we tested the effect of caffeine on circadian rhythms and the expression of disease and metabolic markers in the serum, liver, and jejunum of mice supplemented with caffeine under ad libitum (AL) feeding or RF for 16weeks. Caffeine significantly affected circadian oscillation and the daily levels of disease and metabolic markers. Under AL, caffeine reduced the average daily mRNA levels of certain disease and inflammatory markers, such as liver alpha fetoprotein (Afp), C-reactive protein (Crp), jejunum alanine aminotransferase (Alt), growth arrest and DNA damage 45β (Gadd45β), Interleukin 1α (Il-1α), Il-1β mRNA and serum plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Under RF, caffeine reduced the average daily levels of Alt, Gadd45β, Il-1α and Il-1β mRNA in the jejunum, but not in the liver. In addition, caffeine supplementation led to decreased expression of catabolic factors under RF. In conclusion, caffeine affects circadian gene expression and metabolism possibly leading to beneficial effects mainly under AL feeding.

Abstract: Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPVs) is one of the most promising applications for Photovoltaics (PVs). However, when the temperature in the BIPV increases, the conversion efficiency deteriorates. A PV/PCM system using Phase Change Materials (PCM) for BIPV thermal control has been experimentally and numerically studied previously. One of the main barriers for this application is how to improve the low thermal conductivity of the PCM in order to achieve a quick thermal dissipation response with longer thermal regulation in PVs. Although the metal fins inserted inside the PCM can improve the heat transfer, the thermal regulation period declines as the volume of the PCM is substituted by the metal mass of the PV/PCM system. A modified PV/PCM system integrated with two PCMs with different phase transient temperatures for improving the heat regulation needs to be investigated. The use of combinations of PCMs, each with a set of different phase transient temperatures, is expected to enhance the thermal regulation effect of the PV/PCM system and lengthen the thermal regulation time in PVs. In this study a developed PV/PCM numerical simulation model for single PCM application has been modified to predict the thermal performance of the multi-PCMs in a triangular cell in the PV/PCM system. A series of numerical simulations tests have been carried out in static state and realistic conditions in UK. The thermal regulation of the PV/PCM system with a different range of phase transient temperature PCMs has been discussed.

c-Yes regulates cell adhesion at the blood–testis barrier and the apical ectoplasmic specialization in the seminiferous epithelium of rat testes,

Abstract: During spermatogenesis, extensive junction restructuring takes place at the blood–testis barrier (BTB) and the Sertoli cell–spermatid interface known as the apical ectoplasmic specialization (apical ES, a testis-specific adherens junction) in the seminiferous epithelium. However, the mechanism(s) that regulates these critical events in the testis remains unknown. Based on the current concept in the field, changes in the phosphorylation status of integral membrane proteins at these sites can induce alterations in protein endocytosis and recycling, causing junction restructuring. Herein, c-Yes, a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, was found to express abundantly at the BTB and apical ES stage-specifically, coinciding with junction restructuring events at these sites during the seminiferous epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis. c-Yes also structurally associated with adhesion proteins at the BTB (e.g., occludin and N-cadherin) and the apical ES (e.g., β1-integrin, laminins β3 and γ3), possibly to regulate phosphorylation status of proteins at these sites. SU6656, a selective c-Yes inhibitor, was shown to perturb the Sertoli cell tight junction-permeability barrier in vitro, which is mediated by changes in the distribution of occludin and N-cadherin at the cell–cell interface, moving from cell surface to cytosol, thereby destabilizing the tight junction-barrier. However, this disruptive effect of SU6656 on the barrier was blocked by testosterone. Furthermore, c-Yes is crucial to maintain the actin filament network in Sertoli cells since a blockade of c-Yes by SU6656 induced actin filament disorganization. In summary, c-Yes regulates BTB and apical ES integrity by maintaining proper distribution of integral membrane proteins and actin filament organization at these sites.

Abstract: Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been put forward as a potential low-cost alternative to the widely used silicon solar cells, which are subject to cost limitations. However, some problems need to be solved in order to enhance the efficiency of DSCs. In particular, the electron recombination occurred by the contact between the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and a redox electrolyte is one of the main limiting factors of efficiency. Accordingly, a compact layer plays an important role in realizing highly efficient DSCs because it improves the adhesion of the TiO2 to the TCO and provides a larger contact area and more effective electron transfer by preventing electron recombination. In this work, the fabrication of a TiO2 compact layer using Ti sputter deposition and acid-treatment was investigated rather than the conventional method, which uses a TiCl4 aqueous solution. The acid-treatment of the sputtered Ti film actively oxidized the Ti particles. As a result, such a cell exhibited an additional 1.3% in total efficiency compared to the standard DSC without a compact layer. These improvements are not inferior to those obtained by the conventional fabrication method using a TiCl4 aqueous solution.

Abstract: An efficient single layer organic solar cell based on plain buckminsterfulerence (C60) has been fabricated. By inserting a very thin N,N′-bis(naphthalene-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine layer between the indium tin oxide and single C60 active layer, a short-circuit current of 1.98mA/cm2 and an open-circuit voltage of 0.52V are obtained under 100mW/cm2 AM1.5G simulated illumination. The highest power conversion efficiency of 0.414% based on plain C60 is thus demonstrated, which is the first step to realize an environment-friendly energy source.
