Abstract: In view of the tumor-inhibiting effect of α-santalol in various cancers and the role of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) as an important target for anticancer research, this study investigates the relation between α-santalol and E2F1, as well as the effect of α-santalol on liver cancer progression and the corresponding mechanism. Concretely, liver cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of α-santalol. The IC50 value of α-santalol was determined using Probit regression analysis. Then, transcription factors that are targeted by α-santalol and differentially expressed in liver cancer were screened out. The clinicopathological impact of E2F1 and its targets were evaluated and predicted. The expressions of E2F1 and high-mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) and their correlation in the liver cancer tissues were analyzed by bioinformatics. The effects of E2F1 and HMGB2 on the biological characteristics of liver cancer cells were examined through loss/gain-of-function and molecular assays. With the extension of treatment time, the inhibitory effects of 10 μmol/L and 20 μmol/L α-santalol on cancer cell survival rate were enhanced (P < 0.001). E2F1 and HMGB2 were highly expressed and positively correlated in liver cancer tissues (P < 0.05). High E2F1 expression was correlated with large tumors and high TNM stages (P < 0.05). E2F1 knockdown promoted the effects of α-santalol on dose-dependently inhibiting viability, colony formation, invasion and migration (P < 0.05). Moreover, E2F1 knockdown reduced the IC50 value and HMGB2 level, while HMGB2 overexpression produced opposite effects. HMGB2 overexpression and E2F1 knockdown mutually counteracted their effects on the IC50 value and on the viability and apoptosis of α-santalol-treated liver cancer cells (P < 0.01). Collectively, blocking the E2F1/HMGB2 pathway enhances the intervention effects of α-santalol on the proliferation, migration and invasion of liver cancer cells.

Abstract: Passive radiative cooling technology, reducing space temperature by reflecting sunlight and emitting thermal to the outer space through the atmosphere transparent window, is a potential strategy for energy saving and sustainable development. In this work, a flexible-porous-array cellulose acetate (FPA-CA) film with high reflectivity (0.92) in the wavelength range of sunlight (0.2–2.5 μm) and high emissivity (0.95) in the wavelength range of 3∼20 μm was fabricated through phase separation method. Owing to the designed porous structure and superior optical properties, the back surface of FPA-CA film achieved maximum cooling temperatures of 17.3 °C, 7.8°Crelative to the structure-smooth cellulose acetate (SS-CA) and the FPA-CA film inside space, under solar intensity of 820W/m2, and 7.25 °C,13.5 °C relative to the commercial white paint (CWP) and substrate made of wood material under solar intensity of 710 W/m2, 800W/m2, respectively. The appearance and radiation cooling performance of the prepared coating are both nearly no changed after one year shelved in atmospheric environment. The calculated maximum net cooling power of the FPA-CA film can be achieved 125.09W·m−2. Owing to the fabrication process of the FPA-CA film is simple and suitable for large-scale production, it is extended a novel strategy for developed of radiative cooling and will hold a potential application in electrical equipment, building exterior wall or fabric which needs cooling surrounding.

Abstract: Greenhouse enables to promote plant yield through creating optimal environment. Efficient solar energy conversion and storage is a promising strategy to address energy shortage issue of greenhouse in winter. This paper prepares form-stable composite phase change materials (PCMs) to store solar energy efficiently. Lightweight and porous balsa wood subjected to high-temperature carbonization is designed to simultaneously solve the liquid leakage, enhance the thermal conductivity, and improve the photothermal conversion and thermal energy storage of PCM. OP44E and SEBS are utilized as PCM and thickener, followed by vacuum impregnation into the carbonized balsa wood (CW). Results indicate that carbon content of CW increases with the augment of carbonization temperature. Shaping effects of CW and SEBS endow composite PCMs to have highest adsorption rate of 92.7 wt% with enthalpy over 190 J/g. Composite PCMs reveal reliable thermal properties and thermal stability below 100 °C. Composite PCMs have photothermal conversion larger than 88 % under a xenon lamp radiation. Temperature of PCMs on the shallow layer is higher owing to its photothermal conversion capacity. Greenhouse test indicates that CW/OP44E/SEBS greenhouse gains higher PCM temperature of 71.5 °C at 70 min, compared to 40.3 °C in empty and OP44E/SEBS cases. CW/OP44E/SEBS greenhouse maintaining indoor temperature over 20 °C lasts 15.3 min longer than empty and OP44E/SEBS greenhouses. In addition, form-stable composite PCMs featured with excellent thermal stability and photothermal conversion are capable of maintaining stable indoor temperature of greenhouse, indicating potential in the field of agricultural building temperature regulation.

Abstract: N-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx:H) is potential to enhance the performance of silicon heterojunction solar cells, but the raised plasma damage on underlying layer during the nc-SiOx:H deposition with a high-volume fraction of hydrogen is a burning issue. The underlying intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (i-a-Si:H) bilayer between n-type crystalline silicon (c-Si) and n-type nc-SiOx:H has been investigated by modulating silane (SiH4) gas flow rate (GFR) of interface porous layer. It has been found that the initial H-rich i-a-Si:H bilayer deposited by interfacial 1600 sccm GFR with relatively stable larger voids diameter and less voids number density can not only withstand hydrogen ions bombardment but also passivate c-Si surface well. Meanwhile, it also has been verified that the optimal n-seed deposition can further enhance both total hydrogen content and hydrogen content in compact structure to promote c-Si surface passivation and carrier transportation. The optimized SiH4 GFR for the interfacial i-a-Si:H growth and the appropriate deposition time of n-seed layer have been applied into the front passivation layer of silicon heterojunction solar cells, thus a high efficiency of approximate 25 % with high VOC and FF has been achieved.

Abstract: This study aims to address the best practices and recommendations that contribute to the development of a tailored photovoltaic (PV) module design suited to desert conditions. To realize this customized design, a comprehensive analysis of in-situ aging assessment on five PV systems was undertaken. The initial phase of this assessment involved outdoor visual inspections, revealing visual material degradation modes such as snail trails, delamination, and discoloration. Subsequently, using infrared (IR) imaging and electroluminescence (EL) as powerful techniques, we pinpointed non-visual material issues such as hot spots, potential-induced degradation (PID) on p-type crystalline PV module, and micro-cracks emerging. The trends in the electrical parameters obtained from outdoor-measured I–V curves are analyzed to delve deeper into the performance decline of the PV modules. The findings revealed elevated degradation rates (Rd) values up to 2.7 %/y, largely attributed to the severe climate conditions at the investigation site. This poses significant implications for PV economic viability of the power plant and the payback time in such conditions. By focusing on the key material-related degradation modes that prevail in the exposed five PV systems employing a methodology that leverages Pareto analysis and integrates severity scores assessed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), we analyzed various mitigating solutions to address the dominant observed defects under the challenging desert conditions. Some recommendations on the constitutive parts of the module have been proposed to make them more resilient to the desert environment. These mitigating solutions include recommendations for enhancing the durability of the components of the module to better withstand the harsh desert environment.

Abstract: Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical-epidemiological profile, associated risk factors and clinical outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), identifying the main causes of morbidity and mortality and overall survival rate of patients at five years of follow-up.
Method
This was a retrospective cohort study evaluating the prognosis and clinical outcomes of 222 patients diagnosed with AML at three large hematology centers in Ceará (northeastern Brazil) over a period of five years.
Results
The mean age at diagnosis was 44.1 ± 16 years, with a female prevalence of 1.3:1. No additional relevant risk factors associated with the development of AML were found, except for the well-established cytogenetic assessment. The overall 5-year survival rate was 39.4% (95%CI: 35.47 - 42.17). The main causes of death were disease progression (37.72%; n = 84) and sepsis (31.58%; n = 70).
Conclusion
The clinical outcomes in our sample of AML patients were similar to those of other reported groups. Disease progression and infection were the main causes of death. Access to diagnostic flow cytometry and karyotyping was greater in our sample than in the national average. As expected, overall survival differed significantly according to the risk, as determined by cytogenetic testing.

Abstract: The challenging development/modification of particles to meet the requirements of thermal stability, high absorptance and mechanical resistance with minimal economical cost is a key point to attain for the next particle receivers of concentrated solar power plants. The properties of the particles influence the performance of the system, since the concentrated solar radiation is absorbed and stored in these solid materials. In this work, resulting from the studies carried out within the HORIZON 2020 COMPASsCO2 project, the deposition of black-coloured transition-metal oxides with spinel-like structure coatings on different particles is proven. Five different particles (state-of-the-art and innovative) developed by Saint-Gobain have been coated, studied and compared. The coating deposition was adapted to the dip-coating methodology, ensuring high and good reproducibility. The composition of solid particles as well as the composition of the precursor solution, the curing methodology and the number of deposited spinel layers demonstrate that they have a great influence on the solar absorptance value and the abrasion resistance. Therefore, it is essential to find the perfect balance between all these different parameters in order to achieve the best performance of the particles. The addition of silica nanoparticles in the precursor solution provides rougher layers with enhanced absorptance, up to 0.980, on newly developed particles with excellent thermal stability and abrasion resistance.

Abstract: High structural flexibility has been reported in the central region of BRCA1, which hinders the structural and functional evaluations of mutations identified in the domain. Additionally, the need to categorize variants of unknown significance (VUS) has increased due to the growth in the number of variants reported in clinical settings. Therefore, unraveling the disease-causing mechanism of VUS identified in different functional domains of BRCA1 is still challenging. The current study uses a multidisciplinary approach to assess the structural impact of BRCA1 Arg866Cys mutation discovered in the central domain of BRCA1. The structural alterations have been characterized using Circular-Dichroism spectroscopy, nano-DSF, and molecular-dynamics simulations. BRCA1 Arg866Cys mutant demonstrated more flexibility and lesser affinity to DNA than the wild-type protein. The BRCA1(759–1064) wild-type protein was shown to be a βII-rich protein with an induced D-O transition in the presence of DNA and 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol (TFE). The protein's alpha-helical composition did not significantly change in the presence of TFE, besides an increase in β-turns and loops. Under Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEM), amyloid-like fibrils structure was detected for Arg866Cys mutant whereas the wild-type protein showed amorphous aggregates. An increased ThT fluorescence indicated β-rich composition and aggregation-prone behaviour for BRCA1 wild-type protein, while the fluorescence intensity was significantly quenched in the Arg866Cys mutant. Furthermore, increased conformational flexibility in the Arg866Cys variant was observed by principal component analysis. This work aims to comprehend the inherently disordered region of BRCA1 as well as the impact of missense mutations on folding patterns and binding to DNA for functional aspects.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) present promising solutions for enhancing energy efficiency in solar heat pump systems. In our study, we have innovatively developed a composite PCMs (CPCMs) by combining sodium acetate trihydrate (CH3COONa·3H2O, SAT), lithium chloride (LiCl), potassium chloride (KCl), and incorporating expanded graphite (EG). This addition of high thermal conductivity EG was aimed at bolstering the CPCM's thermal stability. Our findings reveal that SAT-LiCl-KCl/EG CPCMs, with 14 wt% EG, significantly enhances thermal energy storage performance while preserving the fundamental phase change characteristics. The resulting CPCMs demonstrates a phase transition temperature of 49.3 °C and a latent heat of 196.4 J/g, ideally suited to meet the demands of hot water heat pump systems operating in the 45–50 °C range. Notably, the thermal conductivity of this CPCMs, following the incorporation of 14 wt% EG, registers at 4.54 W/(m K), representing a remarkable 10.6-fold increase compared to the SAT-LiCl-KCl ternary eutectic salt. To ensure long-term stability, secondary encapsulation with a thermally conductive sealant was applied. Subsequent tests involved subjecting the CPCM to 3000 heating/cooling cycles, resulting in minimal deviations, with the phase transition temperature shifting by approximately 1 °C and a modest 6 % reduction in latent heat of phase transition. These outcomes underscore the robustness and reliability of our developed composite phase change materials.

Abstract: Background
Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) stands as a significant contributor to cardiovascular mortality, necessitating improved diagnostic tools for early detection and tailored therapeutic interventions. Current diagnostic modalities, exhibit limitations in sensitivity and specificity, urging the quest for novel biomarkers to enhance discrimination of the different stages of ACS including unstable angina, Non-ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).
Methods
This study investigated the potential of a plasma-circulating multi-noncoding RNA (ncRNA) panel, comprising four miRNAs (miR-182–5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-183–5p) and three lncRNAs (SNHG15, SNHG5, and RMRP), selected based on their intricate involvement in ACS pathogenesis and signaling pathways regulating post-myocardial infarction (MI) processes. The differential expression of these ncRNAs was validated in sera of ACS patients and healthy controls via real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Results
Analysis revealed a marked upregulation of the multi-ncRNAs panel in ACS patients. Notably, miRNA-182–5p and lncRNA-RMRP exhibited exceptional discriminatory power, indicated by the high area under the curve (AUC) values (0.990 and 0.980, respectively). Importantly, this panel displayed superior efficacy in discriminating between STEMI and NSTEMI, outperforming conventional biomarkers like creatine kinase-MB and cardiac troponins. Additionally, the four miRNAs and lncRNA RMRP showcased remarkable proficiency in distinguishing between STEMI and unstable angina.
Conclusion
The findings underscore the promising potential of the multi-ncRNA panel as a robust tool for early ACS detection, and precise differentiation among ACS subtypes, and as a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Electrochromic materials and corresponding devices display reversible optical changes under applied voltage. While inorganic and organic electrochromic materials are extensively studied, enhancing their performance is crucial. This study presents a high-contrast energy-efficient flexible electrochromic device based on viologen derivatives and driven by film solar cell. The aims are to foster applications in smart windows, displays, and energy-efficient technologies. Two symmetric viologen derivatives of 1,1′-bis(4-(dimethylamino) phenyl)- [4,4′-bipyridine]dihexafluorophosphate (DNPV) and 1,1′-bis(4-acetamidophenyl)-[4,4′-bipyridine]dihexafluorophosphate (DAcPV) and two asymmetric viologen derivatives of 1-benzyl-1'-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-[4,4′-bipyridine]dihexafluoro-phosphate (Bn-NPV) and 1-(4-acetamidophenyl)-1′-benzyl-[4,4′-bipyridine]dihexa-fluorophosphate (Bn-AcPV) were synthesized. These viologen derivatives as active materials were used to assemble both flexible and rigid electrochromic devices (ECDs). After applying voltage of 1.0 V, both of flexible and rigid ECDs based on DNPV and Bn-NPV exhibited reversible color change from purple to deep purple and red to deep viologen respectively, while ECDs based on DAcPV and Bn-AcPV exhibited a color change from yellow to black and pale yellow to green under applied voltage of 1.2 V, respectively. After 1000 cycles, flexible and rigid ECDs showed good stability. Especially, the flexible ECDs maintained good performance after 1000 bending cycles. In additional, the ECDs based on these viologen derivatives were prepared to displayer, which showed clear display function. And ECDs driven by solar cells demonstrated good stability after 100 cycles. Furthermore, it showed that the rigid ECD based on DAcPV with high solar irradiation modulation of 70.3 %, holds great potential in smart window applications.

Abstract: Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) has a high mortality rate and incidence of complications. The pathophysiology of ALI/ARDS is still not fully understood. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model of ALI has been widely used to study human ALI/ARDS. Sulfasalazine (SASP) has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects and is used for treating inflammatory bowel and rheumatic diseases. However, the effect of SASP on LPS-induced ALI in mice has not yet been reported. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of SASP on LPS-induced ALI in mice. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with SASP 2 h before or 4 h after LPS modeling. Pulmonary pathological damage was measured based on inflammatory factor expression (malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase levels) in the lung tissue homogenate and alveolar lavage fluid. The production of inflammatory cytokines and occurrence of oxidative stress in the lungs induced by LPS were significantly mitigated after the prophylactic and long-term therapeutic administration of SASP, which ameliorated ALI caused by LPS. SASP reduced both the production of inflammatory cytokines and occurrence of oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells, which respond to LPS. Moreover, its mechanism contributed to the suppression of NF-κB and nuclear translocation. In summary, SASP treatment ameliorates LPS-induced ALI by mediating anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may be attributed to the inhibition of NF-κB activation and promotion of antioxidant defenses. Thus, SASP may be a promising pharmacologic agent for ALI therapy.

Abstract: This work presents the development of advanced optical and thermal models for parabolic trough collector systems (PTCs) through an extensive experimental study utilizing a PTMx-24 collector from Soltigua company, installed at Green Energy Park (GEP) research facility. The optical model leverages Tonatiuh software, employing the Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) method. Moreover, a MATLAB script was adjusted to account for Incidence Angle Modifier (IAM) fluctuations in the optical analysis, while incorporating receiver thermal parameters for the thermal analysis. This study assesses the potential of PTCs in the territory of Solar Heat for Industrial Processes (SHIP) over various seasons within a semi-arid climate, offering invaluable insights for sustainable energy utilization. The validation of the models was conducted across four distinct days characterized by diverse meteorological conditions. The optical model demonstrates a remarkable correlation of 97.04 % between the MATLAB script and experimental results. Additionally, results from Tonatiuh software exhibited an important accuracy of 95.92 %. The thermal model showcased outstanding precision, revealing a correlation of 98.5 % compared to experimental results, signifying its adaptability to collectors of varying geometries and parameters. These findings highlight the predictive potential of these models, aiding in the decision-making process to determine the system's performance on specific days with specific meteorological conditions.

The recent improvement in efficiency is due to Se alloying in the CdTe absorbers to form a CdSeTe/CdTe structure. The subsequent band gap grading increases the short circuit current density. The Se can be introduced by depositing a precursor thin film of either CdSe or a CdSeTe alloy and then diffusing the Se into the CdTe during the high temperature cadmium chloride activation process. Using CdSe is preferred because it is easier to control the Se concentration. However, during fabrication of the CdSeTe/CdTe devices, the CdSe thickness needs to be precisely controlled to prevent the retention of a CdSe remnant layer after the activation treatment. Retention of a remnant CdSe layer causes a dramatic reduction in device efficiency. In this work, we show that the reduction in efficiency is caused by a number of factors. The remnant CdSe layer is n-type which moves the position of the p-n junction. Also, it is widely thought that the CdSe remnants are photo-inactive. In this work, we clarify that the individual CdSe grains are actually highly photo-active. However, the grain sizes in the CdSe remnant and the adjacent CdSeTe layer are very small resulting in a high grain boundary area. Although the grain boundaries are passivated with chlorine, cathodoluminescence imaging and electrical measurements show that this is only partially effective. Also, EQE measurements show that the remnant CdSe causes parasitic absorption. Overall, the remnant CdSe layer causes a reduction in short circuit current density and device efficiency. The thickness of the CdSe precursor layer and the cadmium chloride activation process conditions must be precisely optimised to ensure that all the CdSe is consumed and inter-diffused to form the CdSeTe alloy for highest efficiency devices.

Abstract: Next generation concentrating solar power (CSP) plants that use solid particles as the heat transfer and storage medium provide opportunities for higher temperature operation, higher efficiency, and lower levelized cost. However, falling particles over component material surfaces can cause significant erosion, severely limiting the performance and operational service life of the components. An understanding of the particle erosion wear of heat transfer surfaces is imperative for designing components and operating conditions to minimize wear. Considering a shell-and-tube heat exchanger configuration, this study presents a computational analysis coupling falling particle flow around heat exchanger tubes and particle-scale erosion of the tube surfaces governed by the Finnie model. Several tube arrangements, particle flow and geometric parameters, and tube material parameters are systematically investigated for their effects on the erosion rate spatially and with time. Parameters that influence the erosion depth, the cumulative mass loss rate and the maximum erosion rate are elucidated. The results of the study may be used to help identify locations that experience the most erosion and devise ways for targeted erosion mitigation.

Abstract: Traditional water-based PV/T systems have low heat storage density, high PV backsheet temperatures, and low energy utilization in practical applications. In this work, nanoparticles were applied to improve thermal conductivity and simultaneously emulsions were added to enhance energy storage density of the conventional heat transfer media. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of nanocomposite Phase Change Material Emulsions (PCME) as the heat transfer medium on the thermoelectric efficiency of PV/T was studied in a real system. Specifically, the water-based 30 % paraffin emulsions with graphene oxide (GO) concentration of 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 wt% were prepared by ultrasonic stirring and their thermophysical properties were characterized. The results show that the 30 wt% paraffin emulsion with addition of 0.02 wt% GO has the phase change temperature of 35 °C, latent heat of 42.93 J/g, thermal conductivity of 0.505 W/(m·K) and viscosity coefficient of 0.91. It shows the thermal efficiency of the paraffin/GO emulsion increased by 92.28 %, the electrical efficiency increased by 8.87 %, the comprehensive efficiency increased by 45.75 %, and 15.8 % increase in heat collection for the heat exchange tank in comparison with the water. It is concluded application of PCME would improves the thermoelectric performance of the system than traditional water-based PV/T systems.

Abstract: TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) is involved in different cellular processes including signal transduction and transcription regulation. We here provide evidence of a direct interaction between the TRAF domain of TRAF2 and the monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1). Previously, we showed that the TRAF domain occurs mainly in a trimeric form in solution, but it can also exist as a stable monomer when in the nanomolar concentration range. Here, we report that the quaternary structure of the TRAF domain is also affected by pH changes, since a weakly acidic pH (5.5) favors the dissociation of the trimeric TRAF domain into stable monomers, as previously observed at neutral pH (7.6) with the diluted protein. The TRAF domain-GM1 binding was similar at pH 5.5 and 7.6, suggesting that GM1 interacts with both the trimeric and monomeric forms of the protein. However, only the monomeric protein appeared to cause membrane deformation and inward vesiculation in GM1-containing giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). The formation of complexes between GM1 and TRAF2, or its TRAF domain, was also observed in cultured human leukemic HAP1 cells expressing either the truncated TRAF domain or the endogenous full length TRAF2. The GM1-protein complexes were observed after treatment with tunicamycin and were more concentrated in cells undergoing apoptosis, a condition which is known to cause cytoplasm acidification. These findings open the avenue for future studies aimed at deciphering the physiopathological relevance of the TRAF domain-GM1 interaction.

Abstract: An intercomparison of opto-thermal spectral measurements has been performed for some relevant receiver materials in concentrating solar thermal applications, from room temperature up to 800°C. Five European laboratories performed spectral measurements at room temperature, while two laboratories performed infrared spectral measurements at operating temperature up to 800 °C. Relevant materials include Haynes 230 (oxidized, Pyromark 2500 and industrial black coating) and silicon carbide. Two key figures of merit were analyzed: i) solar absorptance αsol at room temperature, over the spectral range [0.3 – 2.5] μm, ii) thermal emittance εth(T), over the common spectral range [2-14] μm, derived from spectral measurements performed from room temperature up to 800 °C. Oxidized H230 reached an αsol value of 90.9±1.0%. Pyromark 2500 reached an αsol value of 96.3±0.5%, while the industrial black coating achieved an αsol value of 97.0±0.4%. Silicon carbide reached an αsol value of 93.5±1.1%. Low standard deviations in αsol indicate reproducible measurements at room temperature. For oxidized H230, the εth,calc(T) value varied from 55% at room temperature up to 81% at 800 °C. For Pyromark 2500 and the industrial black coating, εth,calc(T) fluctuated between 90% and 95%, with a weak temperature dependence. For silicon carbide, εth,calc(T) varied from 70% at room temperature up to 86% at 800 °C. The typical standard deviation among participating laboratories is about 3%. εth,meas(T) values derived from spectral measurements at operating temperature were consistent within a few percentage points in comparison to εth,calc(T) values derived from spectral measurements at room temperature.

Abstract: Objectives
Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are ideal seed cells for periodontal tissue regeneration. Our previous studies have indicated that the histone methyltransferase PRDM9 plays an important role in human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs). Whether FBLN5, which is a downstream gene of PRDM9, also has a potential impact on hPDLSCs is still unclear.
Methods
Senescence was assessed using β-galactosidase and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Osteogenic differentiation potential of hPDLSCs was measured through Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay and Alizarin red detection, while gene expression levels were evaluated using western blot and RT-qPCR analysis.
Results
FBLN5 overexpression promoted the osteogenic differentiation and senescence of hPDLSCs. FBLN5 knockdown inhibited the osteogenic differentiation and senescence of hPDLSCs. Knockdown of PRDM9 decreased the expression of FBLN5 in hPDLSCs and inhibited senescence of hPDLSCs. Additionally, both FBLN5 and PRDM9 promoted the expression of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, Erk1/2 and JNK. The p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor SB203580 and the Erk1/2 pathway inhibitor PD98059 have the same effects on inhibiting the osteogenic differentiation and senescence of hPDLSCs. The JNK pathway inhibitor SP600125 reduced the senescence of hPDLSCs.
Conclusion
FBLN5 promoted senescence and osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs via activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. FBLN5 was positively targeted by PRDM9, which also activated the MAPK signaling pathway.

Abstract: Defects play an important character in the degradation processes of hybrid halide perovskite, hindering their application for solar cells. Ion transport is facilitated by the ubiquitous organic cation and halide anion vacancy defects, which lead to perovskite disintegration at grain boundaries. In this article, a thorough investigation of the vacancy defect and defect density on perovskite is conducted by using VASP and SCAPS-1D. From SCAPS-1D, the PCE of the device increases from 17.82 % to 23.04 % when the defect state density drops from 10+15 to 10+14 cm-3. Therefore, reducing the defect density is very important to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells. Effective perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3 incorporated copper ions passivation defects were carried out. Compare to pristine hybrid perovskite, Cu2+-doped hybrid perovskite have remarkably lower trap-state densities, greater film quality, and higher crystallinity. Especially, the maximum power conversion efficiency of up to 20.1 % was achieved with 0.5 % copper ion doping. After 500 h of not being enclosed in dry air, the devices still has 87 % of its original power conversion efficiency. Therefore, this work suggests that careful control the formation of Cu2+ in perovskite films is very important for diverse optoelectronic applications in the future.

Abstract: The absorbers of kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) that have undergone rapid thermal process (RTP) selenization typically exhibit a double-layer structure, with a fine crystal layer at the bottom, which degrades the performance of devices. We propose an efficient strategy for actively constructing the double-layer absorber to improve the quality of the small grains in the bottom layer. Compared to traditional methods, this method ensures uniform element distribution, particularly for Se element, and enables a more desirable Cu-poor and Zn-rich composition with a Zn/Sn ratio closer to the standard stoichiometric ratio, resulting in a reduction in harmful internal defects. This strategy eliminates small grains at the bottom and decreases grain boundary formation, resulting in a dense double-layer structure. The high-quality CZTSSe absorber not only reduces carrier recombination during back transmission, further reducing reverse saturation current (J0) and increasing optical current density (JL), but also enhances shunt resistance (Rsh) and decreases series resistance (RS). The estimated contribution percent for PCE improvement due to changes in JL, J0, Rsh, RS, and A are 17.20 %, 120.01 %, 1.15 %, 6.50 %, and -44.86 %, respectively. Ultimately, the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) increased from 8.73 % to 10.49 %, and device uniformity improved considerably. This study highlights the significance of optimizing the microstructure of CZTSSe absorber layer in enhancing the performance of CZTSSe solar cells, and will provide guidance for producing high-quality CZTSSe absorber layers.

Abstract: A substantial and problematic ribbon lengthening is sometime observed in PV modules exposed to thermal cycling. In large amplitude thermal cycling, it is systematically observed with standard architectures and materials. To our knowledge, there is no available explanation of this effect in the literature. In the present work, a ribbon lengthening mechanism is derived from a simple three layers model. This mechanism relies on the relative thermal expansion of the copper ribbons with respect to the silicon cell, the elasto-plastic behavior of the ribbons and the temperature dependent visco-plastic behavior of the solder. It neglects the existence of the front/back sheet and the encapsulant. An analytical derivation provides a lengthening criterion which depends on the cycling thermal amplitude. Using the Finite Element Method (FEM), a lengthening rate is predicted. Then, it is measured in single cell strings with different thermal amplitudes by indirect means. Finally, the lengthening rate is also measured in single cell laminated modules using local image correlation. The three layers model predictions are in good agreement with the indirect measurements. Nonetheless, direct measurements results are not consistent with it. From these observations and others, it is inferred that the encapsulant comes into play after the solder failure. Its role is further discussed in the Part II of this work.

Abstract: Radiative cooling technology radiates heat into cold space through the atmospheric window without external energy. Integrating color display and radiative cooling is necessary to meet both aesthetic and practical requirements in real-life applications. In this study, we developed an efficient colored radiative cooler by depositing a cone emitter on an elliptical metal-insulator-metal (MIM) reflector. The upper emitter has an average emissivity of 96.62 % in the atmospheric window, while the lower part is tuned to achieve specific colors. Besides the tunability of geometry parameters, it is possible to produce diverse color display without re-modification of the structure by varying the polarization angle. Meanwhile, high emissivity can be achieved at different incident angles. Finally, the colored logo of Zhengzhou University (ZZU) is realized in our design with the polarization angles of 0° and 45° for comparison. Unlike conventional radiative coolers, our proposed cooler not only adjusts color display through geometry parameters or polarization angle, but also possesses a highly efficient cooling power. These advantages open up new avenues for energy saving, cooling, and color display.

Abstract: By analyzing dislocation ratio data of casting monocrystalline silicon wafers and photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the fabricated solar cells and comparing analyzing growth height and dislocation ratio of silicon crystalline, we derived the calculation equation of dislocation growth in the vertical direction. According to this, the determination software for the dislocation area of casting monocrystalline silicon blocks has been developed, and we realized the adequate delineation and interception of serious dislocation area in casting monocrystalline silicon blocks. The batch conversion efficiency gap between the casting monocrystalline silicon and the Czochralski (CZ) monocrystalline silicon has been narrowed from 0.51 % to 0.19 %, and the low efficiency ratio of casting monocrystalline silicon cells has been reduced from 6.98 % to 0 %. Finally, the stability and competitiveness of casting monocrystalline silicon wafer products have been improved.

Abstract: Semitransparent perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have the potential for utilization in tandem photovoltaics (PV) and see-through PV for building integration. The passage of light through the thin-film device structure requires transparent contact at the front and back sides of the device. Typically, transparent contacts are made of wide bang-gap conductive oxides (In2O3:SnO2(ITO), etc.) deposited by magnetron sputtering (MS). The use of conventional MS usually requires the addition of a buffer layer to avoid the damage of the charge transporting layers. In this work, the semitransparent perovskite solar cell with p-i-n architecture is fabricated with ITO back electrode deposited directly on C60 electron transporting layer. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance and properties of ITO films deposited using ion-beam sputtering (IBS) and the more common MS method. The IBS process was found to eliminate plasma-substrate interaction, resulting in improved deposition on organic layers. Conversely, the MS method resulted in poor output performance and S-shaped IV characteristics of the semitransparent-PSCs. By utilizing IBS fabrication for the back electrode, the relevant efficiency of 12.65% was achieved for the best device. The changes in chemical, optical, and transport properties of the ITO samples fabricated with different methods were investigated. This study represents the first successful utilization of ion-beam sputtering for the fabrication of semitransparent PSCs.

Abstract: Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) with zero energy consumption and green is regarded as one of the most feasible solutions to replace conventional electrical cooling by reflecting sunlight spontaneously and radiating excess heat through atmospheric transparency windows to universe natural heat sink. However, traditional cool building materials are still very limited in practical applications due to contamination by dust, rain, etc., which reduces the cooling capacity in outdoor environments. Herein, we fabricate a hierarchically designed superhydrophobic daytime radiative composite (Al2O3-PDMS/Al2O3-PDMS@Ag/Al2O3-PDMS/SiO2) via facile bladeing film and electroless Ag plating methods, which have strong visible light reflectivity ∼91 % and high mid-infrared emissivity ∼97 %, effectively producing an ambient temperature drop of 13.8 °C on sunny days in direct outdoor sunlight. What's more, the composite has satisfactory superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 154°, making the composite self-cleaning so that the composite is not contaminated and effectively maintains splendid radiative cooling properties. Meanwhile, after prolonged immersion in hydrochloric acid and water shock, the composite retains superhydrophobicity and significant radiative cooling properties, which are of great significance for the sustainable development of energy-saving buildings.

Abstract: The cost-prohibitive ITO and low-temperature silver paste pose significant challenges in the manufacture of SHJ solar cells. The SnO2-based TCO (indium-free) and Cu electroplating are promising solutions to address these issues. The key point of Cu electroplating is the seed layer for achieving good adhesion and low contact resistivity to the TCO. In this study, we report the electrochemical reduction method for the Sn seeds on FTO films, offering an alternative to the costly vacuum deposition process. We reveal that the electrochemical reduction process is dominated by the breaking of lower-energy bonds during electrons injection, resulting in the formation of tin nanoparticles which serve as the excellent seeds for the subsequent electroplating of a nickel metal layer on the FTO film. A tightly binding interface without any pores between the FTO film and Ni was observed, confirming its effectiveness. Our calculation results using the DFT method manifest that the binding energies of Sn/Ni interface are significantly lower than SnO2/Ni, indicating that Sn seeds present a lower energy barrier for deposition, which promotes Ni deposition kinetics. The integration of indium-free TCO, seeds preparation of electrochemical reduction, and copper electroplating is expected to boost SHJ solar cells in near future.

Abstract: Solar interfacial evaporation is a potential and sustainable desalination technology. The structural design of photothermal materials plays an important role in improving the evaporation performance. Here, we propose a new evaporating structure consisting of liquid marble with tunable nanowire array to enhance solar evaporation. Such magnetically responsive nanowire arrays are enabled by controllable assembly of nanoparticles over the surface of liquid marble. Different from the traditional structure, the nanowire array increases light absorption through multiple reflection and to promote steam generation. Besides, the narrow space and local aggregation of particles within the nanowire array hinder heat diffusion to enhance evaporation efficiency. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the concept. The liquid marble with upward nanowire array (ULM) shows outstanding performance with the highest evaporation rate of 8.7 μg/s. This rate is 1.21, 1.04 and 1.04 times larger than that of liquid marble with nanoparticles (LM), left-tilt nanowire array (LLM) and right-tilt nanowire array (RLM). Numerical analysis further illustrates that the nanowire array concentrates the electromagnetic field and heat over the evaporative interface. The induced thermal-boundary layer with high-temperature thus improves the evaporation. This work provides a new concept of solar interfacial evaporation with tunable nanowire array, which has far-reaching implications in seawater desalination or wastewater treatment.

Abstract: Objective
Despite an increase in the rate of successful live donor renal transplantation done annually, the number of potential recipients with acceptable donors is relegated to the ever-expanding cadaver-donor waiting list due to sensitization to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies. If not sufficiently suppressed, these preformed HLA antibodies can trigger antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and early graft loss. To ameliorate this situation, various desensitization treatments are administered to provide a survival benefit to highly sensitized patients.
Method
One hundred and six patients in the time frame of January 2017 to March 2019 were included in the study group. The desensitization protocol included therapeutic plasma exchange and administration of low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (100 mg/kg per therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) session) to highly sensitized patients (treatment group) who subsequently underwent renal transplantation after negative pre-transplant Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Luminex crossmatch (CDC/LumXM). We compared graft survival rates between the group undergoing desensitization (treatment group) and matched control group of patients that underwent HLA-compatible transplantation.
Results
In the treatment group, Kaplan-Meier analysis estimates an average rate of patient graft survival of 95.2% at 3 years post-transplant, as compared with the rate of 86.9% in the same time frame for the control-matched group (p < 0.05 for both comparisons).
Conclusion
Desensitization treatment with TPE before live donor renal transplantation in the case of patients with HLA sensitization provides better survival benefits along with monitoring for donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) and other infections, rather than waiting for a compatible organ donor. The data lays out evidence that desensitization treatments can assist overcome HLA incompatibility barriers in live donor renal transplantation.

Abstract: A novel photothermal conversion microencapsulated phase change material (PDA-MPCM) was successfully prepared, contained n-octadecane (n-OD) as the core material, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as the middle layer, and polydopamine (PDA) as the shell material. The incorporation of PDA enabled PDA-MPCM can obtain excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (73.92 %) and maintain good thermal energy storage capacity (1570 J kg−1 K−1). The PDA-MPCM suspension (PDA-MPCMS) prepared by the two-step method has a long time dispersion stability (more than 72 h) and an ultra-low transmittance (close to 0) in the wavelength range of 200–650 nm. To investigate the photothermal conversion ability of suspension, the stuffy bask experiments were carried out under the real sunlight in the direct absorption solar collector (DASC) with PDA-MPCMS. The experimental results showed that the peak temperature rise of 0.10 wt% PDA-MPCMS was 27.80 % higher than that of the base fluid, and the zero-loss collector efficiency reached 93.6 %. The PDA-MPCMS are expected to play an important role in promoting solar applications.

Abstract: Self-cleaning coatings and/or surfaces have attracted great attention for photovoltaic (PV) panel and building window glass applications. In this work, we have developed TiO2–SiO2-PAA (polyacrylic acid) nanocomposite superhydrophilic coating by spraying and brushing deposition. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), UV–Vis spectra, water contact angle test, photocatalytic activity and waterfall impact test were used to characterize the self-cleaning coating. We found that the introduced PAA in the TiO2–SiO2 nanocomposite can improve the superhydrophilicity, durability and antireflection of the coating. Long-term outdoor tests, ranging from one year to four years, were conducted for the variation of both the average transmission in visible region (400–700 nm) of the coating in glass, PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and PV power generation. The relative self-cleaning efficacy (RSCE) shows different variations over time in the PET and glass substrate. The RSCE of the coating deposited on PET is only about 2 % in the first 150-day period and increases to ∼15 % after that time, which then stabilizes at one year mark. However, for the coating on glass substrate, we found that the average RSCE can be maintained at 4 % within 3 years, then it varies to about 2 % in the fourth year. This is in agreement with our data of the increase (2.8 %) of power generation test in PV panel. Finally, we found that the duration of the coating deposited by spraying was longer than that of deposited by brushing, due to the thinner thickness of the coating deposited by brushing. However, the coating deposited on a commercially available anti-reflection (AR) coating glass surface only becomes effective a month after its application. Our results indicate that the coating has strong potential in applications of PV panel maintenance.

Abstract: While individual borides and, more recently, quinary High Entropy Transition Metal Borides have been investigated, the fabrication and characterization of bulk binary to quaternary solid solutions are barely explored. In this work, dense (Hf0.5Zr0.5)B2 is produced by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) from powders prepared by Self-propagating High-temperature (SHS). SHS produced a multiphase product, whose secondary phases are fully converted into the desired diborides during the subsequent SPS step. Optical properties of (Hf0.5Zr0.5)B2 are evaluated for the first time with focus on the possible use as novel high-temperature solar thermal absorber, by hemispherical reflectance measurements and calculation of solar absorptance, temperature-dependent spectral selectivity and absorber opto-thermal efficiency at various solar concentration ratios. To optimize the material, a chemically etched surface texture was realized to modify the optical properties. The etched sample showed a higher solar absorptance (0.71) and a lower spectral selectivity than the unetched one, with consequent higher opto-thermal efficiency at all temperatures for solar concentration ratios 1000 ÷ 3000, while at lower concentration ratios and temperatures >1400 ÷ 1600 K, the unetched sample shows the highest efficiency. These results show the promising properties of binary diborides for solar thermal applications.

Abstract: Carrier-selective contacts have been widely used to reduce the recombination losses of the minority carriers and boost the transport of the majority carriers at the contact regions for high-performance crystalline silicon solar cells. In this paper, the electron-selective Ta-doped TiOx (TTO) thin films with wide bandgap were prepared by means of low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The systematic examinations were conducted on the interfacial structures, elemental analysis, passivation, and electrical performance of the TTO films. The results demonstrated that ALD TTO thin films possess better surface passivation (τeff = 355.31 μs, 130 °C annealing), and excellent electrical performance (ρc = 0.7 mΩ cm2, 200 °C annealing) on c-Si, in comparison to pure TiOx and TaOx films. Benefiting from these advantages, the optimized TTO based electron-selective contact solar cell achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.58 %, reaching the cutting-edge level of the wide bandgap oxide based electron-selective contact solar cells. The low-temperature, low-energy-consumption and simple ALD TTO electron-selective contacts present a promising approach for Si-based high-efficiency solar cells.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a metal composite prepared using a one-step pressing method, where Al–Si alloy acts as the phase change materials (PCMs) and Al2O3/AlN serve as the structural support materials. The alloy formation and PCM composite preparation are synthesized in a single step. The study aims to characterize the microstructure, thermodynamic, and thermal properties of the composite material. To assess the heat storage properties of the prepared composite PCMs at temperatures higher than 600 °C, a high-temperature test system is established using a high-frequency induction heater. Additionally, we explore how to improve the issue of liquid leakage under high-temperature conditions. The results demonstrate that Al2O3 and AlN (ceramic materials) exhibit excellent chemical compatibility with Al–Si composite PCMs. After sintering, the ceramic materials form a strong bond with Al–Si, effectively retaining the liquid phase of Al–Si alloy within the composite material. Consequently, the Al–Si composite PCMs do not exhibit high-temperature liquid leakage under elevated conditions. Both Al2O3/Al–Si and AlN/Al–Si composites possess favorable high temperature heat storage properties. The phase change enthalpy of Al2O3/Al–Si composite reaches 400 kJ/kg, with a thermal conductivity of 36 W/(m·K). Similarly, the AlN/Al–Si composite achieves a phase change enthalpy of 404 kJ/kg and a thermal conductivity of 43 W/(m·K). Both composites fulfill the requirements for high-temperature heat storage applications.

Abstract: This study investigates the influence of different functional parameters of V-SP blocks on flow characteristics and heat enhancement in a rectangular duct via experimental analysis. The main focus of this work is on designing SAH using a novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. The influence of the different geometrical parameter's e/H = 0.4–1.0, β = 5%–25 %, P/e = 4–12 on the f, Nu and η was investigated and optimized. The combination of Re = 16000, β = 0.2, P/e = 8, e/H = 0.8yielded the most significant Nu (303.70). In contrast, the combination of Re = 16000, e/H = 0.6, P/e = 12, β = 0.15 yield the lowest f (0.083). The maximum η of 2.74 was obtained using Re = 4000, β = 0.2, P/e = 8, e/H = 0.8. Choosing the most suitable SAH design alternative is a challenging task as no single option can fulfil all the attain performance criteria. To address this, a hybrid MCDM approach, namely hybrid BWM-CODAS architecture, was utilized. The design alternative A-20, having geometric and flow arrangement as Re = 16,000, β = 0.2, P/e = 8 and e/H = 0.8 gives the overall performance in addition to another examined alternative. Additionally, the implicit of the proposed decision-making framework was validated with other MCDM approaches, indicating the results' robustness.

Abstract: Molten salt is an excellent medium for heat transfer and storage in solar thermal power generation. The heat transfer and storage performance of molten salt can be significantly enhanced by adding carbon materials. However, the poor dispersion stability of carbon materials in molten salts remains a big challenge. This work reports a kind of dispersive carbon materials in molten carbonate that possess a unique microstructure and are rich in oxygen-containing functional groups. The carbon material was electrochemically produced in molten salt using CO2 as feeding material, which allowed the salt to wet its surface and thereby resulted in good wetting and dispersion properties in molten carbonate. With a carbon concentration of 0.05 wt%, the specific heat capacity of molten Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 increases by 89.6 % from 1.67 J g−1 K−1 to 3.17 J g−1 K−1 and thermal conductivity by 181.9 % from 0.61 W m−1 K−1 to 1.71 W m−1 K−1. Overall, this work opens a new avenue for the application of CO2-derived carbon in efficient heat storage.

Abstract: A problematic ribbon lengthening is sometime observed in PV modules exposed to thermal cycling. In the present work, this phenomenon is studied in high amplitude thermal cycling. Locally, two types of mechanical interactions are at play: the ribbon-cell interaction through the solder and the ribbon-glass one through the encapsulant. In the present work, the first is neglected. Thus, a simple system without cell is considered. A three layers model of this system is derived. Using the elastic solution, a physical lengthening mechanism is proposed. Then, using the Finite Element Method with elasto-plastic and visco-elastic behaviors, more accurate predictions are reported. They provide the main features of ribbons lengthening and its sensitivity to the problem parameters. Experiments are conducted on the simple system and a more realistic one (comprising cells). Both systems behave in a similar fashion after solder failure. Some features of the observed ribbons lengthening are well described by the model. Nonetheless, the encapsulant thickness has a substantial impact on the lengthening. This is not predicted by the model. On ribbons microscope images, there are evidences of ribbon-encapsulant interface failures in all cases. This is not taken into account in the present model and it could be the cause of the reported discrepancy.

Abstract: Boosting short-circuit current density (JSC) is crucial to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. Herein, hydrogenated W, Mo, Ti, Zr, and Ga-doped indium oxide (IMO:H) films are explored and the structural and optical-electrical characteristics were optimized with the gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen and total gas flow rate. IMO:H films exhibit preferential orientation growth in <100> direction and a distinct shift to higher 2θ with the addition hydrogen is observed due to the size mismatch between doped ions and In ions. Furthermore, the carrier concentration of IMO:H films is decreased due to the substitution of oxygen vacancies by hydrogen, leading to the decrement of free carrier absorption and a 1.25%abs increase of effective total transmittance is obtained in the region from 600 to 1200 nm. Additionally, the mobility of IMO:H films enhances to 67.31 cm2V−1s−1 with optimized resistivity of 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm ascribing to the reduction of ionized impurity scattering centers provided by oxygen vacancies. When using IMO:H films as rear electrode in industrial solar cells, a 0.35 mA/cm2 absolute increase of average JSC and a 0.33%abs increase in average fill factor is acquired, respectively. Finally, an average PCE gain of 0.18%abs is come through and the champion cell shows PCE of 23.81 %. This work clearly interprets the functions of hydrogen in IMO:H films and offers a valid guidance to optimize of high-efficiency SHJ solar cells.

Abstract: The Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS), as a specific indicator of hepatocellular carcinoma, exhibits a significant increase in expression. However, its upstream regulatory network remains enigmatic. Previous research has indicated a strong correlation between the Hippo pathway and the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. It is well established that the Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) frequently engages in interactions with the Hippo pathway. Thus, we attempt to prove whether Jun and Fos, a major member of the AP-1 family, are involved in the regulation of BORIS expression. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the existence of binding sites for Jun and Fos within the BORIS promoter. Through a series of overexpression and knockdown experiments, we corroborated that Jun and Fos have the capacity to augment BORIS expression, thereby fostering the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, Methylation-Specific PCR and Bisulfite Sequencing PCR assays revealed that Jun and Fos do not have a significant impact on the demethylation of the BORIS promoter. However, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments substantiated that Jun and Fos could directly bind to the BORIS promoter, thereby enhancing its transcription. In conclusion, these results suggest that Jun and Fos can promote the development of hepatocellular carcinoma by directly regulating the expression of BORIS. These findings may provide experimental evidence positioning BORIS as a novel target for the clinical intervention of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: Hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the most promising candidates to share the future energy market with silicon solar cells thanks to their excellent photovoltaic (PV) properties in single junction and tandem applications. Although PSCs are already highly efficient, their performance can be further improved by passivating the perovskite boundaries and improving current-voltage hysteresis. Here, we implement a double-sided passivation approach to enhance the performance of n-i-p structured PSCs, showing how passivating on either side improves cell performance. The electron-collecting side was passivated with biphenyl-4,4 -dicarboxylic acid (BPDC), and n-octyl ammonium bromide was used to passivate the hole-collecting side. The power conversion efficiency of the champion cell improved from 18.7 % for control to 20.9 % when double-sided passivation was implemented. Surface imaging showed how the surface boundaries improved following passivation, resulting in better open circuit voltages (VOC) and fill factors. In addition, passivation creates a barrier for ion migration, improving J-V hysteresis and stability in the process. The champion cell displayed a VOC of 1192 mV with double-sided passivation, incurring only ∼390 mV loss, thereby achieving a high VOC with a mid-bandgap perovskite. Preliminary degradation testing in ambient conditions shows that double-sided passivation also improves the stability of the cells by impeding ion migration.

Abstract: Photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) is a promising method for increasing current density at relatively low cathode temperatures, but is susceptible to the space charge effect. In this study, we propose a novel PETE device model in which the space-charge barrier is relaxed by photon-excited cesium ions. The decrease in maximum efficiency with interelectrode gap is more gradual compared to previous studies. We investigate the effects of cathode materials properties (band gap and electron affinity) and operating conditions (cathode temperature and interelectrode gap) on PETE performance, and identify optimal performance conditions. Our findings show that the optimal gap range exceeds 5 μm and near field radiation loss can be minimized, providing an important opportunity for designing PETE device with larger interelectrode gaps and higher solar flux concentrations.

Abstract: Although the exact cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still unknown, there is a lot of evidence to support the notion that it results from a combination of environmental factors, immune system issues, gut microbial changes, and genetic susceptibility. In recent years, the role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of IBD has drawn increasing attention. The regulation of IBD-related immunity, the preservation of the intestinal epithelial barrier, and autophagy are all significantly influenced by epigenetic factors. The most extensive epigenetic methylation modification of mammalian mRNA among them is N6-methyladenosine (m6A). It summarizes the general structure and function of the m6A regulating factors, as well as their complex effects on IBD by regulating the intestinal mucous barrier, intestine mucosal immunity, epidermal cell death, and intestinal microorganisms.This paper provides key insights for the future identification of potential new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of IBD.

Abstract: Introduction
Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines have demonstrated good efficacy in preventing relapse and in increasing survival of patients affected by a variety of both solid and hematological tumors. Most protocols used to generate these cells involve the automated separation of peripheral blood monocytes from patients. This approach requires specialized equipment, which elevates the cost of this type of therapy, potentially limiting the widespread access to patients. Method: In this study, we compare the yield and quality of dendritic cells generated from monocytes and isolated by an automated method or by manual methods using gradient centrifugation.
Results
The results demonstrate the equivalence of the 3 methods in relation to the yield and final quality of the product, however with considerable differences between the costs of these procedures. In addition, this study also demonstrates the feasibility of the antigenic pulse with autologous tumor cell lysates, constituting a source of antigens, not only easily obtained and manipulated, but also specific to the patient's tumor.
Conclusion
These findings may have important implications for emerging centers interested in using this medical approach and potentially increase the access of a greater number of patients to this therapeutic option.

Abstract: Objective
This study aimed to determine the clinical outcomes and risk factors affecting mortality in patients with COVID-19 following hematological malignancy (HM).
Methods
Patients diagnosed with HM and hospitalized for COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. The age, demographic and clinical characteristics, prognosis and treatment of surviving and non-surviving patients were compared.
Results
A total of 49 patients were included in this study, 17 (34.6%) of whom died within 28 days of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Older age (p = 0.001), diabetes (p = 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.002), secondary infection (p < 0.001) and secondary bacterial infection (p = 0.005) were statistically significantly higher in non-survivors. The remission status of HM was higher in surviving patients (p < 0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, age (OR: 1.102, p = 0.035) and secondary infection (OR: 16.677, p = 0.024) were risk factors increasing mortality, the remission status of HM (OR: 0.093, p = 0.047) was a protective factor from mortality.
Conclusion
The older age, the remission status of HM and secondary infection due to COVID-19 were determined as prognostic factors predicting mortality in HM patients with following COVID-19.

However, the efficiency of CZTS based solar cell is predominantly governed by the presence and absence of various secondary phases. Identification and estimation of these phases are very crucial for understanding the parameters controlling the formation of these phases. In this work, CZTS thin films are prepared on soda lime glass by magnetron co-sputtering of Cu, Zn, and Sn followed by sulfurization. Precursor composition is varied to control the secondary phase formation during the growth of CZTS layer. Study of various secondary phases formed is done using XANES spectroscopy. Other analyses, like XRD, Raman spectroscopy and optical absorption spectroscopy are used to confirm the results from XANES. It is observed that precursor composition plays a vital role in the selective formation of secondary phase during the growth of CZTS layer. An interesting observation is that bandgap of the secondary phase vis-à-vis CZTS plays a key role in determining the device efficiency. This study highlights that different secondary phases deteriorate the device efficiency in different manner. Secondary phase with much higher band gap then absorber layer deteriorates the device efficiency less compared to the secondary phase having bandgap closer to absorber layer. This also brings out the importance of identification of secondary phase that impact the device efficiency to a greater extent and process parameter that controls its formation.

Abstract: Radiative cooling is highly significant for carbon neutrality and sustainable development. Rapid development has been made for materials of radiative heat dissipation, applicable to sub-ambient and above-ambient cooling. However, scalable and low-cost approach for radiative cooling materials coupled with high thermal conductivity need to be further explored. Here, we present a design strategy for flexible highly thermal conductive hybrid film towards efficient radiative cooling. The proposed thermal conductive radiative cooler (TCRC) consists of interconnected polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) fibrous frameworks and randomly dispersed hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanoplates via electrospinning and hot-pressing processes. Synergistic effects of spectral and thermal conductive properties endow the film with a high solar reflectivity of 0.92 in 250–2500 nm and a broadband mid-infrared (MIR) emissivity of 0.93 in 4–16 μm, while the thermal conductivity reaches over 10 W m−1 K−1. The radiative cooler demonstrates excellent above-ambient cooling performance (∼11 °C) with an effective cooling power of ∼80 W m−2, comparable to the most advanced reports. Besides, the film exhibits superior mechanical strength of 33 MPa and hydrophobicity with 140° contact angle. This work opens up a new avenue of radiative cooling for devices working under both above-ambient conditions.

Abstract: P3HT:PC61BM Janus nanoparticles prepared through nanoprecipitation were integrated in inverted solar cells with three different surfactants: an anionic (SDS), a cationic (C16TAB) and a neutral (pluronic F127). An investigation of the properties at the dispersed state showed no difference between all the surfactants. A thermogravimetric titration method was developed to calculate the residual amount of surfactant in the dispersions. The higher residual content of surfactant in the dispersions resulted in lower electronical properties. The optimum balance was found with SDS, showing the lower surfactant quantity required to achieve nanoparticle stabilisation (10%W), resulting in the minimum amount of insulating molecule in the active layer (PCE = 1.7 %). A systematic comparison is made, between a reference system, solar cells made from a o-dichlorobenzene solution of the active materials (power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 3.2 %). Atomic force microscopy revealed that best performances were linked to the complete sintering of the nanoparticles and an optimisation of the film morphology. While PC61BM aggregation was identified for SDS-based solar cells, a less pronounced aggregation was observed for pluronic F127. To solve this issue, we demonstrated that a slight addition of Pluronic F127 (4%w) in SDS-stabilised dispersion prior to processing the active layer not only ensured a better film formation, but avoided the PC61BM aggregation. As a result, a significant improvement of efficiencies was achieved (PCE = 2.44 %) approaching the reference solar cell efficiency.

Abstract: The nanoparticle aggregation has significant influence on heat transfer properties. The contradictions between different researches exist and the underlying mechanisms of heat conduction remain unclear. To address these issues, the thermal conductivity of solar salt-SiO2 nanofluids in the non-aggregated and aggregated states was investigated, based on the combination of the advantages of molecular dynamics (MD) in revealing physical insights and lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) in simulating properties for complex structures. LBM models were simplified on the basic of MD results. Different heat transfer physics in nanofluids at nanoscale and mesoscale were compared. The results show that the thermal conductivity of aggregated nanofluid is higher than the non-aggregated nanofluid. By analyzing the diffusion coefficient, number density and vibrational density of states, we found that the previous hypotheses (such as Brownian motion, interfacial layer and interfacial thermal resistance) cannot explain the enhanced thermal conductivity induced by the nanoparticle agglomeration. The heat transfer mechanisms of aggregated nanofluid were further analyzed from new perspectives, i.e., the contributions of different material components and fluctuation modes to heat flux. It is found that the nanoparticle aggregation leads to the nanoparticle contribution increase, indicating the formation of low thermal resistance channels within the aggregates. The heat conduction contributed by collision decreases in the aggregated state, while that contributed by potential energy increases. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of aggregated nanofluid is negatively correlated with temperature, aggregate size and fractal dimension of agglomerates, and positively correlated with mass fraction of nanoparticles, degree of agglomeration, and backbone length of each aggregate.

Abstract: Solar selective absorption films based on anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) photonic crystals were prepared by an anodization under periodic current-pulses, subsequently with an alternating current electrodeposition of Co and Ag in sequence. The phase structure, microstructure, and solar selective absorption properties of the Co–Ag electrodeposited film were investigated in comparison with a Co electrodeposited counterpart. Moreover, the stability of the properties against thermal annealing was examined for the two films. A one-dimensional photonic crystal structure was verified for the AAO part in both films, with the first-order photonic bandgap occurring at around 4 μm, while the metals were confirmed to be deposited at the bottom of the AAO part in the form of nanoparticles. For the Co–Ag electrodeposited film, the Ag nanoparticles were deposited over those of Co. The Ag electrodeposition not only was contributive to the solar selective absorption properties, but also substantially improved the stability of the properties against thermal annealing. The Co–Ag electrodeposited film exhibited an infrared emissivity of 0.12, a solar absorptivity of 0.94, and a spectral selectivity of 7.83 before experiencing thermal annealing, while retained a decent spectral selectivity of 6.00 after being annealed in air at 300 °C for 24 h.

Abstract: In this work, we have demonstrated the possibility to reduce silver consumption for highly efficient SHJ cells by fine-line screen printing using low temperature paste with a variety of screens with different meshes and openings. The achieved grid fingers were characterized for the line resistance and the printed width. Extremely narrow grid fingers with 13 μm width were realized on the 520-mesh. Compared to a standard 380-mesh, finer 520-mesh produced fingers that are on average 4 μm narrower and 8% less resistive, leading to a 0.08%abs. higher efficiency whilst reducing the overall silver consumption by 15%. Complementary simulations have shown that module wire configuration is an important driver to reduce silver consumption. Integration of test samples in modules showed that 1.6 mg/W frontside paste laydown resulted in marginally lower performance than reference samples with laydown of 4–6 mg/W.

Abstract: There is an urgent need to develop a technology for recycling solar waste that will soon be generated in heaps. While various studies focused on recovering valuable materials from waste silicon solar panels, there has been minimal emphasis on the treatment of toxic substance lead. Thus, the current study proposed a novel approach to treat the harmful component of lead by recovering it in its less toxic form as PbO having commercial applications. This is accomplished through optimization of a three-step process (i) selective leaching of the top layer from interconnect, (ii) extraction of lead from the leachate by precipitation, and (iii) calcination. The lead recovery at each stage was analyzed by characterization techniques viz. ICP-OES, XRD, SEM, and a unique attempt has been made to optimize the precipitation process by constructing an Eh vs. pH diagram. The efficient leaching of lead from interconnects was observed with 1.5 M nitric acid for 5 min at 60 °C which was followed by precipitation from the leachate with 1.5 M NaOH solution and finally calcination at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain lead monoxide. The feasibility of the optimized process at a larger scale was carried out with 200 g (60-cell panel) of copper ribbons.

Abstract: The ionic conductivity of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) is usually provided by the added inorganic salt ions. Here, we report a salt-free poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) hydrogel electrolyte with an ionic conductivity of 3.7 × 10−3 S cm−1. The carboxylic groups of PAA can release free H+ ions to provide ionic conductivity, which not only simplifies the preparation of GPEs, but also benefits the fabrication of GPEs with high transparency (>95.6 % from 400 to 1000 nm). The as-prepared hydrogel electrolyte is assembled into an electrochromic (EC) device (ECD) by using Prussian blue/PAA GPE/hydrated tungsten trioxide. The fabricated ECD achieves a high optical modulation (72.7 %), fast responses (2.6 s for coloration and 2.2 s for bleaching), a high coloration efficiency (172.9 cm2 C−1) and good cycling stability (retaining 96.3 % of the original optical modulation after 1200 cycles). Moreover, the ECD has good energy storage properties, demonstrating a potential application for energy-storage smart windows.

Abstract: A variety of polymeric backsheet materials can be found in fielded photovoltaic (PV) modules, mostly based on fluoropolymer and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) materials. Cost reduction and sustainability considerations drive the recent development of alternative backsheet materials and designs [1]. In some fielded PV installations, polymeric materials are susceptible to environmental degradation in the form of backsheet cracking. To prevent backsheet degradation that can result in a module failure, thorough laboratory reliability testing is needed. Here, we studied the durability of seven commercial and experimental PV backsheets through accelerated stress testing using seven photolytic, hygrometric, and custom tests with the goal to understand if novel fluoropolymer-free backsheets are sufficiently environmentally durable to be commercialized. We divided the mechanisms observed during aging into two categories: core degradation and surface degradation. Although core degradation due to hydrolysis was observed in all commercial PET-, and polyamide (PA)-based backsheets aged with 85 °C/85 % relative humidity, this test is unlikely to be field relevant. Photo-oxidative reactions on the exposed surface during UV weathering affected all seven backsheets regardless of the outer layer polymer material and additives. This degradation was limited to the outermost micrometers of the surface, except for backsheets containing PA-12, which resulted in surface cracking. A custom test combining UV with water spray caused the most severe backsheet degradation, including surface erosion and loss of insulating properties in polyolefin (PO)- and PA-based backsheets. This highlights the importance of combined accelerated stress testing to screen for complex backsheet degradation mechanisms. We also showed that, with material and design optimization, coextruded experimental PO-based backsheets have the potential to be a durable alternative to commercial PET- and fluoropolymer-based PV backsheets.

Abstract: Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy Type 1E (HSAN1E) is a rare autosomal dominant neurological disorder due to missense mutations in DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). To investigate the nature of the dominant effect, we compared methylomes of transgenic R1wtDnmt1 and R1Dnmt1Y495C mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) overexpressing WT and the mutant mouse proteins respectively, with the R1 (wild-type) cells. In case of R1Dnmt1Y495C, 15 out of the 20 imprinting control regions were hypomethylated with transcript level dysregulation of multiple imprinted genes in ESCs and neurons. Non-imprinted regions, minor satellites, major satellites, LINE1 and IAP repeats were unaffected. These data mirror the specific imprinting defects associated with transient removal of DNMT1 in mESCs, deletion of the maternal-effect DNMT1o variant in preimplantation mouse embryos, and in part, reprogramming to naïve human iPSCs. This is the first DNMT1 mutation demonstrated to specifically affect Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs), and reinforces the differences in maintenance methylation of ICRs over non-imprinted regions. Consistent with nervous system abnormalities in the HSAN1E disorder and involvement of imprinted genes in normal development and neurogenesis, R1Dnmt1Y495C cells showed dysregulated pluripotency and neuron marker genes, and yielded more slender, shorter, and extensively branched neurons. We speculate that R1Dnmt1Y495C cells produce predominantly dimers containing mutant proteins, leading to a gradual and specific loss of ICR methylation during early human development.

Abstract: Introduction
Interleukin-22 (IL-22) has been proven to exhibit a protective role in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI). This study aimed to explore the change of IL-22 and IL-22 receptor 1 (IL-22R1) axis in HIRI and its role in mitochondrial apoptosis associated with STAT3 activation.
Materials and Methods
I/R mice were examined for the expression of IL-22, IL-22R1 and IL-22BP. The roles of IL-22 in hepatic histopathology and oxidative stress injuries (ALT, MDA and SOD) were determined. Oxidative stress damages of AML-12 cells were induced by H2O2, and were indicated by apoptosis, Ca2+ concentration, and mitochondrial function. The effects of IL-22 on p-STAT3Try705 were analyzed.
Results
We found that the expression of IL-22, IL-22R1, and IL-22BP was elevated 24 h after I/R induction, while decreased 48 h after I/R induction. Furthermore, we also discovered that IL-22 rescued the morphological damages and dysfunction of hepatocytes induced by H2O2, which were antagonized by IL-22BP, an endogenous antagonist of IL-22. Additionally, increased levels of Ca2+ concentration, MDA, ROS, apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction were noticed in H2O2-treated hepatocytes. However, IL-22 ameliorated the effects of I/R or H2O2. The protective effects of IL-22 were reversed by AG490, a specific antagonist of STAT3.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our results indicated that IL-22 inhibited I/R-induced oxidative stress injury, Ca2+ overload, and mitochondrial apoptosis via STAT3 activation.

Abstract: The integration of nanostructures on top of solar cells has been previously demonstrated as an effective method to increase the collection efficiency by coupling to sunlight. In this work, this approach is implemented by using core-shell gallium nanoparticles (Ga-NPs) as functional light scatterers on III-V solar cells, investigating how the Ga-NPs affect their photovoltaic performance. The effect is studied in GaAs and in GaAsSbN superlattice-based solar cells with different bandgaps for a wide range of Ga-NPs sizes. After NP size optimization, average improvements in the short-circuit current around 18 % are obtained in both types of solar cells with these nanostructures. The underlying physical mechanism is studied by performing optical measurements and simulations. It is found that the Ga-NPs can be treated as an antireflection coating due to both their geometry and the refractive index in the cases when their localized surface plasmon resonances do not spectrally overlap with the solar cell absorption range. Lastly, a facile method to attenuate the plasmonic effect of the Ga-NPs it is also shown as a proof of concept. In this method, an annealing treatment at low temperature is performed causing an improvement of the photovoltaic performance. This work demonstrates that Ga-NPs can successfully enhance the efficiency of III-V solar cells in a very controllable manner and paves the way for the design of new functional nanostructures.

Abstract: Dispensing of metal pastes shows impressive performance and promises higher throughput with lower metal laydown than screen printing. Given the market introduction planned for latest 2024, and with the objective to fully automate the metallization process, an in-line visual control and inspection unit is being developed. Utilizing this tool, process time and paste laydown was reduced by another 10 % and 20 % respectively, after optimization within four consecutive cells only. Consequently, recent cell results on industrial precursor SHJ showed an increased efficiency by +0.4 %_"abs“ while having a reduction in paste usage of 40 %, compared to the screen printing reference. In this paper, we outline the path of development with a focus on first results with this new digital tool that has the potential to lift future PV metallization to a completely automated production state with higher performance, yield values and lower downtimes.

Abstract: The mismatched energy level alignments, back interface defects in the perovskite/carbon back interface, as well as low conductivity of carbon counter electrode are the primary factors for the low photovoltaic behavior of all-inorganic hole transport layer (HTL)-free perovskite solar cells (C–PSCs) using carbon counter electrode-based. Herein, 2D layered Ti3C2 and N–Ti3C2 are proposed to form Ti3C2@carbon and N–Ti3C2@carbon counter electrodes for modifying the perovskite/carbon back interface. First, the appropriate work function of Ti3C2 can optimize the energy level alignments. Second, nitrogen doping can enhance the conductivity of Ti3C2 which can lower the total resistance of the device. Third, the specific 2D layered structure Ti3C2 and N–Ti3C2 can reduce back interface defects. Therefore, the perovskite/carbon back interface shows improved charge extraction and transport capabilities disclosed by photoluminescence measurements. Consequently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of the C–PSCs are enhanced to 7.56 % from 5.94 % by using Ti3C2@carbon counter electrode, and further to 8.91 % by using N–Ti3C2 @carbon counter electrode, indicating remarkable PCE improvements of 27.3 % and 50.0 %. Moreover, the Ti3C2@carbon and N–Ti3C2@carbon-based C–PSCs show remarkable stabilities under ambient conditions for 30 days. This work is expected to provide a feasible path to optimize the back interface of the all-inorganic C–PSCs.

Abstract: Quantitative electrical analysis of sub-cells is crucial for the designing of high-efficiency GaAs multi-junction laser power converters (MJLPCs). However, finding suitable bias lights to separate the electrical performance of sub-cells is an enormous challenge, due to GaAs MJLPCs being assembled by GaAs p-n junctions. Therefore, this study proposes a novel and general method of determining bias lights for the SR measurement of GaAs MJLPCs based on the variation rules of simulated short-circuit current densities with wavelengths in the sub-cells of GaAs MJLPCs. By the method of determining bias lights, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of a GaAs four-junction LPC have been successfully measured for the first time, which confirms the validity of the method.

Abstract: Electrochromic (EC) technology is highly desirable in energy-conserving bistable displays as it can dynamically modulate color changes under small voltages and maintain the changed color after the power is cut off. For its practical application, low cost, easy fabrication and good durability are crucial. The shoulder-by-shoulder EC structure is talented in achieving low cost and easy fabrication because the counter electrode and its corresponding conductive layer were not necessary in it. Moreover, the EC material determines the stability against light radiation and long-term use. Herein, crystalline NiO films were selected owing to their gifted structure stability in crystalline state, and were fabricated through the sputtering process at a high deposition rate of 50 nm/min. The NiO film was further optimized to a laminated structure with the room-temperature-deposited NiO at the top and the 100 °C-deposited NiO at the bottom adjacent to ITO substrates as the adhesive layer. A high optical modulation rate of 59 % and excellent cycling stability with only 6 % degradation over 3000 cycles were achieved. Bistable price tags were then designed using the high-performance laminated NiO film and shoulder-by-shoulder EC structure. Thus fabricated EC material will significantly advance the applications of EC technology in various intelligent display scenarios.

The efficacy of this process flow in addressing the challenging issue of microscopic hidden cracks in PV cells, which commonly occurred during the processing of PV/T modules, was confirmed through a comprehensive electroluminescence testing procedure. An analysis was conducted to examine the interrelationship between the thermal pressing process, peel strength, and crosslinking degree of the hot-melt adhesive film on both the absorber plate and external surface of the transparent TPT (Tedlar/PET/Tedlar) layer. The results indicated that a high level of peel strength (50 N/cm to 80 N/cm) was achieved between the adhesive film and absorber plate with a selective absorption coating, while ensuring compliance with crosslinking requirements and preventing bubble issues. Therefore, the novel process method proposed in this paper for PV/T modules can effectively address the bottleneck of lifespan issues that have remained unresolved in PV/T technology for years.

Abstract: The current work demonstrates the successful metallization of a PERC silicon solar cell with screen-printable copper (Cu) paste that is sintered at elevated temperature in air atmosphere. The existing state of the art in Silicon (Si) solar cell metallization is silver (Ag) paste; Cu cost is 1/100th the cost of Ag and has a comparable conductivity. However, Cu undergoes rapid oxidation at elevated temperatures and the high diffusion of Cu into Si restricts its usage in the metallization of silicon solar cells. In this paper, a Cu paste containing a proprietary mixture of antioxidant additives and diffusion inhibitors was used to make front gridlines on PERC cells. The Cu-printed cells were fired in an IR belt furnace with a peak temperature of 576 °C in air atmosphere. The solar cells discussed here reached an efficiency of 19%, which is 88% of the efficiency measured for a commercial Ag-printed cell. The working devices were further characterized using STEM, EDX, ToF-SIMS and long-term suns-Voc studies demonstrating an absence of Cu diffusion. Furthermore, thermally stressing the Cu-printed solar cells yielded a reduction of less than 1.9% of the initial pseudo fill factor (pFF) after 1000 h at 200 °C. The shunt resistance of cells monitored over 3 years remained within 2.5% of its initial value, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the Cu diffusion barrier.

Abstract: Effects of the ultra-thin silicon oxide (SiOx) on tunnel oxide passivated contact solar cells (TOPCon) are investigated in this paper. The experiment is fabricated to study the TOPCon electrical performance with different SiOx thickness and the champion efficiency is achieved by the TOPCon with a 1.5 nm SiOx layer, with Voc 698.93 mV, Jsc 40.14 mA/cm2, FF 81.03 and efficiency 22.73 %. For futher understanding, EDNA2 and AFORS-HET are used to simulate the relationship between the SiOx thickness, rear SRV and the doping concentration in n+ layer. It indicates that the total J0 at the SiOx-(c-Si) interface (J0, interface) can be affected by the phosphorus concentration at the SiOx-(c-Si) interface. Besides, due to the variation of SRV or P-doped concentration, different recombination mechanisms, including auger recombination and surface recombination, will dominant the total J0, interface. In addition, the sensitivity of TOPCon solar cells electrical performance to SiOx thickness can be affected by rear SRV, and the sensitivity of TOPCon solar cells electrical performance to rear SRV can be affected by SiOx thickness.

Abstract: Determining exactly how the performance of a thin-film photovoltaic device is limited by a particular recombination mechanism can be difficult, particularly in the case of CdTe solar cells. As a result, efforts are being made to improve all parts of the device without good knowledge of which improvements are necessary. To understand where the device limitation is, the recombination current densities of at least one on of the interfaces must be known. Here, we present a method to determine which recombination mechanisms is limiting. First, back illuminated quantum efficiency measurements are used to determine the key parameters of the back interface – the back surface recombination velocity and the band bending near the back surface. Once these back interface parameters are determined, the recombination current densities can be calculated for a front illuminated device to determine the limiting mechanism. The validity of the approach is tested using previously reported data.

Abstract: The temperature dependence of photovoltaic modules varies with temperature and irradiance. For recent high-efficiency solar modules such as silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar modules and tunneling oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar modules, it is not clear how their temperature dependence changes with temperature and irradiance. In this study, the temperature dependence of SHJ and TOPCon solar modules was studied by measuring I–V curves with the irradiance ranging from 200 to 1000 W/m2 and temperature ranging from 25 to 75 °C. The passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) solar modules were measured as a reference. The results indicate that the temperature dependence of short-circuit current (Isc) for the three modules is almost invariable with temperature and irradiance. The temperature dependence of open-circuit voltage (Voc) and maximum power (Pm) decreasees with the increasing module temperature, and increasees with the increasing irradiance. It can be observed that the absolute magnitude of (∂Pm/∂T)/Pm for SHJ is the smallest, which is more obvious at high irradiance. An interesting finding is that the temperature dependence of fill factor (FF) for SHJ solar module increases with increasing irradiance, which is opposite to PERC and TOPCon solar modules. This phenomenon is related to the temperature dependence of series resistance. In addition, the temperature dependence is not linear at low temperature and irradiance. The obtained results in this paper can provide useful insight into predicting performance ratio of PERC, SHJ and TOPCon solar modules.

Abstract: Abstract: In this paper, to simulate the dynamic corrosion mechanisms of metals exposed to a high-temperature molten salt mixture of NaNO3–KNO3, the experimental samples made of commonly used stainless steel alloys such as 304 (with/without welds) and Q275 were suspended, along with stirring blades, in a specially designed stirred kettle to obtain their corrosion characteristics. For the experimental samples, the Q275 surface exhibited significant quantities of Fe3O4 and Fe2O3, while 304 generated FeCr2O4, Cr2O3, and MgFe2O4 with protective effects. The microstructure of the welding zone in 304 exhibited considerable disparities compared to that of the base material, consequently leading to augmented susceptibility towards localized corrosion. The uneven distribution of chromium in the welding zone resulted in intergranular corrosion and alterations in the crystal structure. Moreover, experimental studies have demonstrated that NO3- in the molten salt undergoes decomposition to generate oxygen ions, which contribute to the corrosion reaction. Notably, under all test conditions, the corrosion rate of samples exhibited the following ranking: 304 (without welds) < 304 (with welds) < Q275.

Abstract: Fast and reliable performance monitoring of photovoltaic modules is essential for economic forecasting in large-scale installations. Deep Learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks, have the potential to predict module power directly from electroluminescence images in an automated workflow. However, neural networks must be trained using large numbers of electroluminescence images of defective modules. Due to budgetary or technical limitations, these training images will always be biased, limiting generalization. Here, we demonstrate a transparent method to discriminate the information learned by a convolutional neural network into generally valid physics and bias. Learning of physics is assessed by providing an artificial, unbiased feature list, which is converted into synthetic electroluminescence images. Using these images, we compare the predictions of the neural network trained on the biased dataset to those of a physics-based equivalent. Bias is assessed by a closer look at the deviations between the predictions from the equivalent circuit model and the trained neural network. The assessment of physics knowledge incorporated by a Deep Learning method gives insight into how the method achieves its predictive capacity.

Abstract: The thermal conductivity, thermal cycling behaviour, and deformation resistance of composite phase change materials (cPCMs) based on sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) can be effectively improved using expanded graphite (EG). Existing studies have primarily focused on the effect of the expansion ratio on the cPCMs of SAT, and the effect of the particle size of EG on the cPCMs of the SAT has received limited attention. Additionally, more research is required on the degree of supercooling and effective thermal cycles in thermal cycles. In this study, the effects of EG of different sizes (250 and 425 μm) and proportions (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 wt %) on the thermal properties and the phase change behaviour of cPCMs in thermal cycles were studied. The results revealed that the 425 μm EG had a better effect on improving the thermal conductivity of the cPCMs, whereas the 250 μm EG had a better effect on improving the thermal cycling stability of cPCMs, as evidenced by the sample with 3 wt% of 250 μm EG completing 512 solidification cycles out of 530 thermal cycles.

Abstract: Introduction
Treatment of hemophilia A in Brazil is offered to all patients at no cost. However, several unmet medical needs exist.
Method
In this study, we applied the Delphi method to discuss with seven hemophilia A specialists the challenges that patients and the health system face regarding hemophilia A treatment and opportunities for improvement.
Results
A consensus was obtained regarding the number of weekly infusions and patient adherence to treatment. The bleeding profile, unfavourable pharmacokinetics (PKs), low adherence and high daily activity were patient profiles that would benefit from using the extended half-life (EHL) recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII). The advantages of treatment with the EHL rFVIII were the lower number of infusions per week, which could increase patient adherence and decrease the risk of bleeds, due to a more constant plasma level, a lower value. Additionally, the EHL rFVIII could improve quality of life, especially in patients with high daily activity, such as adolescents and young adults. The panelists mentioned that EHL rFVIII, if available, could be offered first to the priority group (adolescents between 12 and 19 years old), followed by adults (20 to 64 years old) and elderly people (over 65 years old).
Conclusion
In summary, the EHL rFVIII offers the optimal prophylaxis by decreasing the dose frequency, increasing the treatment adherence and improving the QoL, without compromising safety and efficacy.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage, management, and utilization with phase change materials have received increasing attention in industrial fields such as photo-thermal-electric conversion and integrated circuit cooling. However, the inherent low thermal conductivity and melting leakage are long-term bottlenecks that prevent their widespread commercial application. Herein, a novel composite phase change material (CPCM) with high-thermal conductivity and stability based on bionic porous SiC skeleton is proposed, which is oriented by optimized freeze casting to design vertical tree-ring porous structure for fast photo-thermal conversion and storage. The results demonstrate the novel bionic SiC skeleton can regulate the porosity (50%–70%) by changing the slurry solid content, which also exhibits good anisotropic thermal conductivity. SiC/paraffin CPCM's mass and latent enthalpy of attenuated merely by 0.87% and 1.5% after 200 repeated heat storage/exhaustion cycles, confirming its excellent longevity and stability. The high-temperature SiC/NaCl-MgCl2-KCl CPCM has a thermal conductivity of 12.54 W‧m−1‧K−1, an effective thermal-storage density per production cost of 74.5 kJ‧CNY-1, and a high photo-thermal storage efficiency of 91.8%. Finally, a variable-power chip dissipation experimental system was built to verify the thermal performance of the CPCM module in the paper. It could dissipate heat rapidly and maintain a lower temperature. This work provides a promising strategy for photo-thermal utilization and thermal management of electronic devices.

Abstract: Background
Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 2 (PYCR2) expression is aberrantly upregulated in colon cancer. However, the functions and underlying mechanisms of PYCR2 in breast cancer remain elusive. The primary objective of the present study was to elucidate the function of PYCR2 in breast cancer and investigate whether PYCR2 may be transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc to activate the AKT signaling pathway.
Methods
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to examine the expression of PYCR2 in breast cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Western blot and RT-qPCR were utilized to detect PYCR2 expression in breast cancer cells. Cellular functionalities were evaluated through Transwell assays in vitro and lung metastasis formation assays in vivo. Moreover, the impact of PYCR2 on the activation of AKT signaling was determined through western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis. The transcriptional regulation of PYCR2 expression by c-Myc was evaluated via both western blot analysis and luciferase gene reporter assay.
Results
PYCR2 overexpression was noted in breast cancer. Silencing PYCR2 expression attenuated the invasive and metastatic abilities of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the activation of the AKT signaling pathway is indispensable for the promotion of invasion and metastasis mediated by PYCR2. Lastly, the binding of c-Myc to the promoter sequence of PYCR2 resulted in the upregulation of PYCR2 transcription.
Conclusion
Taken together, these results indicate that PYCR2 is transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc and promotes invasion and metastasis in breast cancer through the activation of the AKT pathway.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have become the main source of attraction among photovoltaic researchers since its inception in 2009 due to their steady enhancement in efficiency and cost-effective fabrication methodologies. The integration of the concept of multijunction or tandem technology with Perovskite solar cells is considered to be one of the best substitutes for designing efficient Solar Cells. Recently, the perovskite/silicon tandem architecture possesses tremendous research potential owing to their capability to generate competitive efficiencies. In this research article, we have analysed the optoelectronic properties of CsGeI3 with the WIEN2K tool for first principle computations through the density functional theory methodology. The bandgap of CsGeI3 is found out to be 1.6 eV. Calculated bandgap and absorption coefficient spectra are used as input parameters for device simulation using the SCAPS-1D tool. Environment-friendly CsGeI3 and c-Si are used as top cell and bottom cell absorbers respectively with the two cells connected in series with an ITO interconnecting layer for the proposed tandem solar cell architecture. Under current matching scenario and AM 1.5G spectrum illumination, the standalone top cell shows PCE of 18.31 %, Voc ∼1.20 V, Jsc ∼17.55 mA/cm2 and FF ∼86.42 % for 265 nm thick CsGeI3 layer, while bottom cell when subjected to the spectrum transmitted by top cell, provided a PCE of 10.15 % with Voc∼ 0.703 V, Jsc ∼17.50 mA/cm2 and FF ∼82.62 % with 400 μm thick c-Si absorber. Before being implemented in the tandem configuration, simulated J-V characteristics of both top and bottom cells are calibrated to show close agreement with the experimental results. The two-terminal tandem device demonstrates an improved PCE of 28.43 %, FF of 84.90 %, Jsc of 17.55 mA/cm2, and Voc of 1.90 V. The effect of Rs and Rsh and the interfacial and bulk defect states on the photovoltaic parameters (PCE, FF Jsc, and Voc) is also analysed. Finally, a semi-analytical model is used to validate the J-V characteristics of the tandem architecture obtained with SCAPS-1D simulator using an equivalent circuit model of two series-connected diodes. This study can open new directions for the design of eco-friendly lead-free perovskite/c-Si based tandem devices with superior photovoltaic characteristics.

Abstract: Solar-driven interfacial evaporation (SIE) has been receiving more and more attention on the stage called “Sustainable Development”. However, pursuing a rational coexistence of steady-state evaporation, endogenous resource recovery, and water decontamination in solar evaporators is still a great challenge. To address this problem, a one-dimensional water transport pathway chitosan-based multiphase evaporator (OCHE) was fabricated for simultaneous Marangoni-driven salt mitigation and dye adsorption while solar vapor generation. Due to the efficient energy utilization and water supply, OCHE achieves a water evaporation rate of 1.767 kg m−2 h−1 with an energy efficiency of 96.87% under one sun illumination. More importantly, the 1D water pathway induces directional solute capillary convection and thermocapillary convection in evaporator when OCHE is working in high-salinity brine, leading to localized salt harvesting driven by Marangoni-driven liquid transport. Moreover, OCHE exhibits the good adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO). This versatile multiphase evaporator provides a new insight into the design of next-generation eco-friendly, salt-resistant, and in-depth water purification solar evaporators.

Abstract: Solar power tower plants widely rely on molten nitrite salt as heat transfer fluid and storage media. However, its corrosiveness endangers several metallic components, with central receivers being one of the most compromised. Great efforts are being made to establish molten salt corrosion in different metals. Recently, the importance of the amount of salt used in these experiments has been highlighted. Yet, most tests disregard the hot-receiver-surface/salt ratio that would represent the receiver operation conditions. Commonly, larger metal surfaces are employed, accelerating molten salt thermal decomposition kinetics. Hence, this study seeks to develop basic design conditions for experimental corrosion tests to realistically mimic receiver-tube corrosion. Consequently, the high-temperature operation of two receiver designs, resembling those of Crescent Dunes and Gemasolar plants, with their tubes manufactured in HA230, is analysed. The yearly salt degradation in these plants is found to be nearly negligible due to the large salt volume stored and the relatively limited receiver surface above concerning temperatures, with the whole salt volume being exposed to it for around 20 min during a 25-year operation for large receivers. Moreover, the hot-metal-surface/solar-salt ratio ranges from 5 to 7 mm2/kg, depending on the receiver design, which should be preserved in a corrosion experiment. Metal loss is also estimated: less than 7 % of the receiver would lose at least 50 % of the initial tube thickness. Still, lower metal loss rates are expected since coefficients from static-isothermal tests were employed for the calculation, which also disregarded the metal surface/salt proportion, leading to an overestimation.

Abstract: The anti-reflective coating (ARC) is an essential component in inverted metamorphic triple-junction gallium arsenide (GaAs) solar cells (IMM-SCs) to improve the light absorption and efficiency. The common approach to realize AR function is to construct a multilayer thin-film with a gradient refractive index (n) change from air to the solar cell. In this study, SiO2 nanopillars (SiO2-NPs) are implemented as the top layer in multilayer thin-films to enhance their broadband anti-reflection capability. The transfer matrix method and electron beam (oblique angle) deposition process are applied for the design and fabrication of the multilayer thin-films, respectively. By optimizing the thickness and n of SiO2-NPs thin-films, an IMM-SC with a SiO2-NPs/Al2O3/TiO2 ARC is achieved with an average reflectivity as low as 5.506% in the 300–1300 nm range. The proposed ARCs have significant implications for the window layer designs of high-performance multi-junction solar cells.

Abstract: The next generation Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants integrated with Thermal Energy Storage (TES) offer a promising solution for dispatchability, reliability, and economic concerns associated with renewable energy technologies. However, the expected operational life of up to 30 years proves to be a major challenge due to the impact of high temperatures and corrosive eutectic salts utilised in the latent heat TES systems. Additionally, the system is under varying degrees of stress that can accelerate corrosion mechanisms. Unfortunately, this stress corrosion relationship is often neglected during the material compatibility assessment. This study utilises a novel static immersion testing approach with three designs of modified Compact Tension (CT) specimens manufactured from AISI 316L to investigate the interaction of alloys under stress with various eutectic salts at up to 750 °C for up to 1000 Hours. The results indicate that oxidation is accelerated up to four times and Intergranular Corrosion (IGC) up to two times in the high-stress region of the test samples. Furthermore, the findings suggest that static immersion testing using CT specimens can be regarded as an effective approach to assess the influence of stress on corrosion and conduct a reliable material assessment for latent heat TES systems and CSP plants.

Abstract: Polymer encapsulants used in photovoltaic (PV) modules experience severe UV aging during more than 25 years of module’s operation. However, the current standard qualification tests cannot provide a sufficient solution able to mimic the UV exposure in the field. IEC 61215 defines the requirements for UV stability of PV modules with very low cumulative UV dosage. While the new IEC 62788-7-2 imposes higher UV dosages on polymers films, the used UV testing procedure allows the use of either UV-A fluorescence lamps or xenon lamps, yielding different spectra. The given work compares the effect of different lamp spectra, based on IEC 62788-7-2, on the aging behavior of the encapsulant. For this purpose, coupons (glass/encapsulant/busbar/encapsulant/backsheet) using the common encapsulant ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and the emerging encapsulants polyolefine (POE) and thermoplastic polyolefine (TPO) were manufactured. The samples were weathered under different UV conditions for a total duration of 2500 h with extraction times of 250 h. Photodegradation was observed for all encapsulants and weathering types. However, in general the weathering with UV-A lamps inflicted significantly less damage. The formation of unsaturated carbon bonds because of polymer backbone decomposition was only reported for xenon lamp weathering. The carried out experiments suggest that xenon lamps, providing more realistic accelerated aging, should be predominately used in the UV weathering standards in the PV industry, whose current versions are to be accordingly reconsidered.

Abstract: The carrier lifetime stability of gallium-doped silicon wafers and performance stability of industrial PERC solar cells produced from sister wafers were investigated under four different illumination conditions and temperatures. The seven investigated materials feature a resistivity variation of 0.4–1.0 Ωcm and lifetime samples were processed to create high hydrogen content (with PECVD SiNx) or low hydrogen content (with ALD Al2O3 or HfO2). Our results confirm that the material itself is prone to light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID), however experiments on PERC cells produced utilising the same silicon material indicate that the production process can successfully suppress LeTID. In contrast to earlier studies, we observe only small levels of degradation at the cell level, with some showing an improvement in cell parameters under LeTID testing conditions. Our results indicate that LeTID is not necessarily a major issue for the performance of modern passivated emitter and rear cells made from gallium-doped silicon substrates.

Abstract: Solar water evaporators were fabricated with wasted scrub pad (SP) and their performance for the desalination/decontamination of water was evaluated. Firstly, bare SP was utilized for the desalination of seawater obtained from Puerto Vallarta beach, Mexico. SP produced an evaporation rate (ER)/efficiency of 2.18 kg m−2 h−1/72.6 %, respectively, under natural solar light. Subsequently, the SP evaporator was coated with graphene (G) + porous BiFeO3 (BFO) microparticles. This SPG + BFO evaporator produced an outstanding evaporation rate/efficiency of 2.93 kg m−2 h−1/94.6 %. Thus, the evaporation rate and evaporation efficiency increased by 33 % and by 22 % after adding the graphene + BFO coating. Absorbance and Raman analysis on the evaporators’ surface revealed that the evaporators made with graphene + BFO had higher absorbance of NIR light and higher content of defects. This favored the transformation of light to heat and steam generation. Additionally, the SPG + BFO evaporator was employed for the decontamination of water. Laundry wastewater (LWW) and domestic-wastewater contaminated with coke-soda (WCS) or coffee-drink (WCD) were also decontaminated using the SPG + BFO evaporator. The LWW contained mainly suspended solids, while the WCS and the WCD contained caffeine. The clean water obtained from the evaporation of LWW, WCS and WCD was completely free of suspended solids or caffeine as demonstrated by the FTIR and absorbance measurements. Overall, the results of this investigation demonstrate that low-cost evaporators can be fabricated from wasted scrub pads and those ones are very efficient for the evaporation/decontamination of water. Giving a second use to the wasted scrub pads benefits the environment because this delays its contamination by plastics.

Abstract: In order to increase the performance of solar tower power plants, it is necessary to improve the receivers in order to reach higher temperatures or a longer life span. Silicon carbide is a promising material for this purpose, but large parts cannot be made in one piece: a joining process is required. BraSiC® brazing alloys have been developed to produce silicon carbide assemblies that can withstand temperatures of about 1000°C, but their thermomechanical behavior is poorly understood. The understanding of the failure mechanisms as well as the knowledge of the limits of use of these materials is essential to be able to produce reliable receivers. In this article, two types of BraSiC® braze have been studied: CEA 0 and CEA 1, using the IMPACT test bench, specifically developed to characterize materials under concentrated solar flux. The results show that the CEA 1 braze is more resistant to thermomechanical stresses. Two damage mechanisms of the brazed joints were also identified using acoustic emission.

Abstract: Wearable electrochromic (EC) devices can adjust visible-infrared spectra demonstrate promising potential for applications in display, decoration, personal thermal management, and adaptive thermal camouflage. However, existing flat layer-layer EC devices are hindered by poor air permeability, limited flexibility, and integration difficulties with fabrics, particularly in the realm of intelligent wearables. The creation of highly efficient fiber-shaped infrared (IR) modulation devices with exceptional structural and performance stability represents a significant challenge. We draw inspiration from the arboreous vine-stems structure observed in Chinese wistaria, which effectively minimizes the risk of damage to their vine and stems during harsh weather conditions. We have successfully designed a wearable high efficient multiband spectral regulation fiber (MSRF) with a bioinspired vine-stems structure using carbon fiber and polyaniline (PANI) as the active layer. The planar working electrode (Au) with PANI deposited on its surface was spirally wound around the counter electrode (carbon fiber) and separated by a gel electrolyte (PC/LiClO4), with polyolefin serving as the encapsulation layer. The distribution of electrical potential and lithium ions in the MSRF were analyzed using finite element analysis, demonstrating exceptional electrochromic stability without the length limit of the fiber. Moreover, the MSRF exhibited exceptional IR emissivity (△ε = 0.528) within the 8–14 μm range, fast response time (2.44 s) at low applied potentials (−0.8 V and 0.8 V), robust long-term cycling stability (at least 5000 cycles), and remarkable mechanical stability (at least 5000 bending cycles). The compatibility of the fiber with fabric and potential for patterning using MSRF with high length was also explored, providing new insights into the development of wearable adaptive thermal camouflage and spectral regulation fiber devices.

Abstract: This work presents two approaches to reduce the silver (Ag) amount on the rear side of M2-sized industrial tunnel oxide passivated contact (iTOPCon) solar cells by (partially) substituting conventional Ag pastes with copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) pastes. The first approach is Cu-based and works by screen printing an Ag layer with ca. 75% Ag paste reduction compared to a conventional Ag layer (functioning as a contact and Cu barrier layer) and screen printing a full-area Cu layer on top of the Ag layer (functioning as a conduction layer compensating the reduced Ag amount). This Cu-based approach yields similar power conversion efficiency (η) compared to the conventional approach, showing the Cu-based approach is promising for iTOPCon solar cells. The second approach is Al-based and works by laser contact opening of the dielectric layers and screen printing a full-area layer with an Al paste – adapted to properly contact an n+-poly-Si layer –, substituting Ag on the rear side entirely. This Al-based approach exhibits a 0.9%abs η gap to the conventional approach, mainly stemming from the Al paste damaging the poly-Si layer, while – on a positive note – neither rear p+ layer formation nor tunnel oxide layer penetration by the Al paste is detected. Even though the abovementioned η gap must be eliminated in the future, it shows the principal functionality and potential of such type of contact for iTOPCon solar cells.

Abstract: BNIP3 localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane, has been demonstrated to be extensively involved in abnormalities to mitochondrial metabolic function and dynamicsand in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, its role in NAFLD under hypoxia remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression and the role of BNIP3 in NAFLD under hypoxia, and explore its involvement in regulating NAFLD mitophagy, fatty acid β-oxidation both in vivo and in vitro. BNIP3-mediated mitophagy level was analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The role of BNIP3 in fatty acid β-oxidation was evaluated using lipid droplet staining, triglyceride content determination, and cellular energy metabolism. The results showed that compared with the HFD-2200 m, the body weight, inflammatory liver injury, and lipid deposition were significantly reduced in the HFD-4500 m group (P < 0.05), but autophagy and mitophagy were increased, and the expression of the mitophagy receptor BNIP3 was increased (P < 0.05). Compared to the control group, BNIP3 knockdown in the hypoxia group resulted in decreased levels of CPT1, ATGL, and p-HSL in lipid-accumulating hepatocytes, lipid droplet accumulation and triglyceride content increased (P < 0.05). Moreover, the ability of lipid-accumulating hepatocytes to oxidize fatty acids was reduced by BNIP3 knockdown in the hypoxia group (P < 0.05). Therefore, it can be concluded that, in NAFLD mice under hypoxia, BNIP3-mediated mitophagy promotes fatty acid β-oxidation. This study elucidated the role of BNIP3 in promoting fatty acid β-oxidation in NAFLD under hypoxia, and suggests BNIP3 may serve as a novel potential therapeutic target for NAFLD.

Abstract: Introduction
The hemogram and hemogram-derivative ratios (HDRs) are becoming markers of the severity and mortality of COVID-19. We evaluated the hemograms and serial weekly HDRs [neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-platelet ratio (NPR) and systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII)] in the survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the medical notes and serial hemograms of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 adults hospitalized from April 2020 to March 2021 from the time of diagnosis to the 3rd week of diagnosis.
Results
Of the 320 adults, 257 (80.3%) were survivors and had a lower mean age than the non-survivors (57.73 vs. 64.65 years, p < 0.001). At diagnosis, the non-survivors had lower hematocrit (p = 0.021), and lymphocyte (p = 0.002) and basophil (p = 0.049) counts and the hematocrit showed a p-value (Is this what you meant???) of 0.021); higher NLR (p < 0.001), PLR (p = 0.047), NPR (p = 0.022) and SII (p = 0.022). Using general linear models, the survivors and non-survivors showed significant variations with weekly lymphocyte count (p < 0.001), neutrophil count (p = 0.005), NLR (p = 0.009), MLR (p = 0.010) and PLR (p = 0.035). All HDRs remained higher in the non-survivors in the 2nd week and 3rd week of diagnosis and the HDRs were higher in the intubated patients than in the non-intubated patients. The NLR and SII were more efficient predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients.
Conclusions
This study shows that serial lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, NLR, PLR, MLR, NPR and SII could serve as good and easily accessible markers of severity and predictors of outcomes in COVID-19 patients and should be used for the monitoring of treatment response.

Abstract: Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) constitute a crucial group of transcription factors widely present in various organisms. They act as transcription factors, nucleases, and RNA-binding proteins, playing significant roles in cell differentiation, growth, and development. With extensive research on ZFPs, their roles in the determination of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) fate during osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation processes have become increasingly clear. ZFP521, for instance, is identified as an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway and RUNX2's transcriptional activity, effectively suppressing osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, ZFP217 contributes to the inhibition of adipogenic differentiation by reducing the M6A level of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 (CCND1). In addition, other ZFPs can also influence the fate of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) during osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation through various signaling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic controls, participating in the subsequent differentiation and maturation of precursor cells. Given the prevalent occurrence of osteoporosis, obesity, and related metabolic disorders, a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms balancing bone and fat metabolism is essential, with a particular focus on the fate determination of MSCs in osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. In this review, we provide a detailed summary of how zinc finger proteins influence the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs through different signaling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic mechanisms. Additionally, we outline the regulatory mechanisms of ZFPs in controlling osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation based on various stages of MSC differentiation.

Abstract: Solar-driven interfacial evaporation for sustainable production of clean water from seawater and organic wastewater is viewed as a cutting-edge and practical technology to solve the shortage of fresh water. Here, we provide a novel strategy for constructing oxygen vacancy-rich In2O3/TiO2 composite to apply in water purification. It is found that oxygen vacancy enhances light absorbance, reduces light reflection, and decreases the thermal conductivity, being beneficial for photothermal conversion and heat confinement. On the other hand, oxygen vacancy-rich In2O3/TiO2 composite offers an excellent photocatalytic degradation, which can improve the quality of the purified water and keep surface and interface clean, and thus enhance durability of photothermal material. To compare with In2O3/TiO2, In2O3/TiO2* with rich oxygen vacancies markedly enhances the evaporation rate of pure water from 1.04 to 1.51 kg m−2h−1 under 1 sun illumination, corresponding photothermal conversion efficiencies of 58.6% and 90.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the evaporator constructed with In2O3-TiO2* displayed 1.47 and 1.49 kg m−2h−1 for seawater and lake water, respectively, close to pure water under 1 sun illumination. Besides, this evaporator also offered an excellent purification and photocatalytic degradation for organic wastewater during the solar-driven evaporation. Importantly, this evaporator also could synergistically generate electricity, achieving a maximum electrical power of 1.23 W m−2 under 1 sun. This work demonstrates the preponderance of the oxygen vacancy-rich material, and expands the application of the defected In2O3/TiO2 composite in solar-driven interfacial evaporation.

Abstract: High-power optical transmission (HPOT) enables the uninterrupted transfer of power in the order of hundreds of watts over several kilometers, freeing power systems from traditional wiring constraints. Its vast versatility of applications ranges from the ocean depths to outer space. In recent years, particular emphasis has been placed on the development of efficient methods to transfer substantial amounts of power from future space-based solar power stations, which intend to generate clean energy 24/7, to Earth. Despite the immense potential of HPOT, further endeavors should be undertaken in order to enhance overall system efficiency, currently hindered below 20%. A contributing factor to this unsatisfactory performance is the state-of-the-art selection of semiconductors that constitute the receivers of the monochromatic light: the optical photovoltaic converters (OPCs). Therefore, this work aims to identify the most suitable semiconductor materials for high power (∼100 Wcm−2) and beyond transmissions in terrestrial and underwater environments. In addition, the first analytical model capable of evaluating, predicting and designing OPCs and its electrical characteristics is provided. The results indicate that III-V wide-bandgap semiconductors (≈2.5 eV), such as InGaN and InAlN, could yield significant efficiency improvements in air and, especially, in subaquatic domains with respect to existing GaAs-based devices.

Abstract: Introduction
As 30 to 50% of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) cases remain idiopathic, an increased focus on hematologic variables may therefore reveal novel correlates of DVT. Very few studies have investigated the association of hematological parameters with DVT and the causal relationship between them is still to be elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between serial values of hematologic variables and DVT.
Methods
Complete blood count parameters were serially measured at baseline and then at approximately 3-month intervals for 12 months in 152 adults with the first episode of DVT and 152 age- and sex-matched controls. The odds ratio (OR) with the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was calculated as a measure of association between hematological parameters and DVT.
Results
The red cell distribution width (RDW) was the only hematologic variable which showed an independent and consistent association with DVT at all time points (multivariable-adjusted OR [95%CI] 3.38 [1.28 – 8.91] at baseline, 2.24 [0.85 – 5.92] at 3 months and 2.12 [0.81 – 5.55] at 12 months for RDW > 14.0%). This association was higher for provoked DVT than unprovoked DVT and for DVT plus pulmonary embolism than DVT alone. No significant correlation was found between the high RDW and classical thrombotic risk factors, except malignancy.
Conclusions
We demonstrated an independent and consistent association of the high RDW with the first episode of DVT in adult patients. The study was probably underpowered to evaluate the association between the high RDW and recurrent DVT. Further large studies with long follow-up are needed to confirm this association.

Abstract: The dramatic boost in work efficiency of computers has led to miniaturized electronics being used in harsh outdoor environments. For example, single-board computers (SBCs) are expected to function stably in near-enclosed surroundings. The traditional heat dissipation strategies of thermal conduction and convection cannot remove heat from an enclosure. In this study, we employ the concept of daytime radiative cooling (DRC) for effective thermal management of the central processing unit (CPU) of SBCs. Metaparticles composed of multiple ceramic materials display high broadband emissivity (>0.95) in mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) to long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) ranges, as well as solar reflectance of greater than 0.97. When the SBCs were operated in a sealed space, the metaparticles lowered the temperature of the CPU by more than 10 °C under intense solar irradiance (ca. 1000 W/m2) and by 5–7 °C during the night. Compared with SBCs operated without DRC strategies, the metaparticles led to a 60–70 % improvement in the performance of the image frame rates of the visual identity system of an enclosed SBC integrated into an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) under sunny weather. Thus, by passively cooling the CPU, the metaparticles significantly improved the efficiency of SBCs and maintained the reliability of USVs.

Abstract: The CaCO3/CaO materials are promising materials for thermochemical energy storage. However, they suffer from rapidly decreasing energy storage density over multiple calcination/carbonation cycles. This paper aims to select suitable inert supports with cyclic stability enhancement for the calcium looping (CaL) process at high carbonation reaction temperatures (＞800 °C). Firstly, four metallic elements (Zr, Mn, Y and Ce) were selected, and a single-doping strategy was used to screen out single-doping inert supports. By comparison, the 20Ca–Zr had the best energy storage performance, with an energy storage density (Eg,N=30) of 1744.72 kJ/kg after 30 cycles. Subsequently, the co-doping method was applied to further screen out co-doped combinations with long-term cyclic stability potential. The Zr was co-doped with Mn, Y and Ce, respectively. Among them, the 20Ca-0.5Zr-0.5Y displayed the best cyclic stability with an average energy storage density (Eg,av) of 1950.69 kJ/kg in 30 cycles. Based on the chosen Zr–Y co-doped CaO-based composite, the doping concentration optimization and multiple cycles tests were carried out. The effective conversion (Xeff) of 10Ca-0.5Zr-0.5Y decreased by only 4.9 % after 60 cycles. Therefore, the Zr–Y co-doped CaO-based composite, possessing robust sintering resistance effects, is promising for long-term TCES technology.

Abstract: Calcium-based materials (CaCO3/CaO) have shown significant potential for use in thermochemical energy storage systems for concentrated solar power generation due to their low-cost, high-energy storage efficiency, and operational temperature range. However, the energy storage performance of calcium-based heat carriers degrades rapidly over cycles due to high-temperature sintering, limiting practical applications. In this study, we incorporated Zr into CaO using both heat-drying and freeze-drying methods, forming CaZrO3 as a physical barrier to prevent agglomeration and sintering of calcium particles at elevated temperatures. Experimental results demonstrated that Zr incorporation markedly improved cyclic energy storage stability, particularly for heat carriers derived from freeze-drying. Cao incorporated with 10 % CaZrO3 (FD-Zr10) showed a high energy storage density of 2161.75 kJ/kg over ten storage/release cycles, which was 25.89 % higher than that of pure CaO sample. Even over an extended operation of 30 cycles, FD-Zr10 still possessed the high energy storage density of 1939.76 kJ/kg. CO2-containing harsh storage conditions caused more sintering for the heat carriers, thus resulting in the performance reduction, but FD-Zr10 performed much better than other samples in resisting sintering. Various characterization analyses were conducted to investigate the reasons for the samples' cyclic stability. It was discovered that freeze-drying incorporation generated a dendritic surface with a more abundant pore structure, and the incorporated CaZrO3 functioned as a metal skeleton to mitigate high-temperature sintering.

Abstract: Low-temperature contact techniques offer benefits for various solar cells, including tandem solar cells, which risk degradation from high-temperature contact fabrication for top cell materials, such as in III-V/Si multijunction cells. This paper presents aluminum (Al) doped and induced poly-Si (formed through annealing at 190 °C for 5 min) as localized contacts on p-type silicon absorbers. This approach avoids the high-temperature processes required for poly-Si formation and the toxic gases involved in in-situ doping through chemical vapor deposition. Raman spectroscopy confirms poly-Si formation due to Al-induced recrystallization of a-Si:H(i), with electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV) measurements validating Al doping in the newly-formed poly-Si. The contact stack of p-Si/a-Si:H(i)/Al exhibits ohmic behavior after annealing at 190 °C for 5 min, achieving a contact resistivity of ∼13.2 mΩ⋅cm2. Finally, a cell featuring a localized Al-doped poly-Si contact structure is fabricated, realizing a 3% absolute efficiency improvement compared to a full-area Al back contact cell.

Abstract: This paper reports experimental results on the impact of the temperature and spectral conditions on the behaviour of III-V multi-junction solar cells, employed in concentrator photovoltaic modules, operating under ultra-high concentration (UHC) conditions. The electrical parameters of the I–V curves of a 3-junction solar cell were measured using an experimental set-up based on a multi-flash indoor solar simulator, which allows adjustment of the cell operating temperature up to 85°C and reaching irradiance concentration levels up to 2200 suns under controlled spectral conditions. The measurements presented are unprecedented, as there are no previous publications that combine different spectral and temperature-controlled experimental conditions in the UHC range, thus extending the range of studies reported in works carried out at lower concentrations.

Abstract: We present highly conductive and transparent p-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide (p-type nc-SiOX:H) layers produced by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) at 130°C and 150°C. We report on the crystalline volume fraction (XC), spectral broadening parameter C, and dark conductivity (σ) as functions of the growth temperature and RF power, and how these properties evolve with post-deposition annealing at 250°C and 300°C. Interestingly, we observe that the best layers in terms of crystalline volume fraction and conductivity are obtained at the lowest temperature and RF power, which we attribute to the soft landing of silicon nanocrystals synthesized in the plasma. The p-type nc-SiOX:H layers with the best properties on glass substrates are implemented as carrier-selective contacts in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells with the structure: (n) a-Si:H / (i) a-Si:H / n-type c-Si / (i) a-Si:H / (i) a-SiOX:H / (p) nc-SiOX:H / (p) nc-Si:H where all films are deposited by PECVD. The cells were completed with sputtered ITO on the front and rear sides plus Ag on the rear side, and Ag grid on the front, with the best devices showing conversion efficiencies of 21.8%, which, contrary to a-Si:H contact layers, are preserved or even slightly improved upon annealing at 240°C.

Abstract: Microparticles (MPs) are a heterogeneous subpopulation of extracellular vesicles that originate from the plasma membranes of cells. There is increasing evidence that tumor-derived MPs (T-MPs) play a significant role in tumor progression and immune response in cancer. In our study, we found an increased secretion of MPs in osteosarcoma tissues obtained from metastatic patients. These T-MPs promoted polarization of M2-like macrophages and stimulated the migration and chemoresistance of osteosarcoma cells. Mechanistically, T-MPs promoted macrophage polarization to an M2-like phenotype through TBK1-STAT6 signaling. Consequently, these M2-like macrophages mediated osteosarcoma cell migration via CCL18/STAT3 signaling. Blockade of STAT3 signaling pathway improved the outcome of chemotherapy in LM8-bearing osteosarcoma mice model. Thus, our study reveals how tumor cells regulate macrophage polarization by releasing MPs and provides new insights into clinical osteosarcoma therapy.

Abstract: This work presented a highly efficient, porous and floatable sodium alginate/carbon black (SACB) gel beads by instantaneous gelation method for photothermal interfacial evaporation. We thoroughly examined how NaHCO3 and CB affect the performance of photothermal evaporation. As a consequence, the ideal porous SACB gel beads displayed an exceptional evaporation rate of 1.39 kg m−2 h−1 and a superior photothermal conversion efficiency of 97.76 % under 1 sun illumination. Additionally, the resulted SACB gel beads maintained good recyclability even after 10 repeated evaporation cycles, and the fresh water collected after evaporation complies with WHO and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The SACB gel beads developed in this work have a remarkable capacity for photothermal conversion and would be a strong contender for solar-powered seawater desalination.

The role of high mobility group AT-hook 1 in viral infections: Implications for cancer pathogenesis,

Abstract: The crucial role of high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1) proteins in nuclear processes such as gene transcription, DNA replication, and chromatin remodeling is undeniable. Elevated levels of HMGA1 have been associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes and adverse differentiation status across various cancer types. HMGA1 regulates a diverse array of biological pathways, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha/nuclear factor-kappa B (TNF‐α/NF‐κB), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Hippo, Rat sarcoma/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Ras/ERK), protein kinase B (Akt), wingless-related integration site/beta-catenin (Wnt/beta‐catenin), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3‐K/Akt). While researchers have extensively investigated tumors in the reproductive, digestive, urinary, and hematopoietic systems, mounting evidence suggests that HMGA1 plays a critical role as a tumorigenic factor in tumors across all functional systems. Given its broad interaction network, HMGA1 is an attractive target for viral manipulation. Some viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1, human herpesvirus 8, human papillomavirus, JC virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2, and influenza viruses, utilize HMGA1 influence for infection. This interaction, particularly in oncogenesis, is crucial. Apart from the direct oncogenic effect of some of the mentioned viruses, the hit-and-run theory postulates that viruses can instigate cancer even before being completely eradicated from the host cell, implying a potentially greater impact of viruses on cancer development than previously assumed. This review explores the interplay between HMGA1, viruses, and host cellular machinery, aiming to contribute to a deeper understanding of viral-induced oncogenesis, paving the way for innovative strategies in cancer research and treatment.

Abstract: Laser welding can be used to interconnect high-efficiency back-contact silicon solar cells with low-cost Al foil. This interconnection approach is relatively new and, thus, requires detailed vetting of its reliability before being adopted commercially. In this study, we weld 50-μm-thick Al foil to Sunpower back-contact cells and observe that the laser-weld adhesion, module fill factor, and reliability through thermocycling are all highly correlated to each other. A JMP statistical model built from adhesion data reveals that the statistically significant parameters to improve laser-weld adhesion are the laser pulse energy, pulse density, and pattern. Increasing the laser pulse energy and density improves the foil adhesion to the cell metallization, which is likely because of the improved melting of the Sn capping layer on the Cu electrode of the cells, as identified by cross-sectional microscopy. 94.4% of the modules fabricated using laser welds with a mean adhesion above 0.8 mJ lost less than 5% of their initial maximum power after 200 thermocycles, which is the IEC 61215 criterion for any single accelerated stress test. Additionally, 90.0% of modules fabricated with an as-fabricated module series resistance below 1.9 Ω cm passed thermocycling. Thus, laser-weld adhesion and the as-fabricated module series resistance can be used in the further development of new laser-weld settings and as quality control parameters in the manufacturing of these modules.
