Abstract: The morphological features of the olfactory mucosae of Korean roe deer, Capreolus pygargus, were histologically studied using the ethmoid turbinates containing the olfactory mucosae from six roe deer (male, 2–3 years old). The ethmoid turbinates were embedded in paraffin, and histochemically evaluated in terms of the mucosal characteristics. Lectin histochemistry was performed to investigate the carbohydrate-binding specificity on the olfactory mucosa. Lectins, including Triticum vulgaris wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I), and soybean agglutinin (SBA) were used for the N-acetylglucosamine, fucose and N-acetylgalactosamine carbohydrate groups, respectively. Histologically, the olfactory mucosa, positioned mainly in the caudal roof of the nasal cavity, consisted of the olfactory epithelium and the lamina propria. The olfactory epithelium consisted of protein gene product (PGP) 9.5-positive olfactory receptor cells, galectin-3-positive supporting cells and basal cells. Bowman's glands in the lamina propria were stained by both the periodic acid Schiff reagent and alcian blue (pH 2.5). Two types of lectin, WGA and SBA, were labeled in free border, receptor cells, supporting cells and Bowman's glands, with the exception of basal cells, while UEA-I was labeled in free border, supporting cells and Bowman's glands, but not in receptor cells and basal cells, suggesting that carbohydrate terminals on the olfactory mucosae of roe deer vary depending on cell type. This is the first morphological study of the olfactory mucosa of the Korean roe deer to evaluate carbohydrate terminals in the olfactory mucosae.

Abstract: Summary
Dynein recruitment to the nuclear envelope is required for pre-mitotic nucleus-centrosome interactions in nonneuronal cells and for apical nuclear migration in neural stem cells. In each case, dynein is recruited to the nuclear envelope (NE) specifically during G2 via two nuclear pore-mediated mechanisms involving RanBP2-BicD2 and Nup133-CENP-F. The mechanisms responsible for cell-cycle control of this behavior are unknown. We now find that Cdk1 serves as a direct master controller for NE dynein recruitment in neural stem cells and HeLa cells. Cdk1 phosphorylates conserved sites within RanBP2 and activates BicD2 binding and early dynein recruitment. Late recruitment is triggered by a Cdk1-induced export of CENP-F from the nucleus. Forced NE targeting of BicD2 overrides Cdk1 inhibition, fully rescuing dynein recruitment and nuclear migration in neural stem cells. These results reveal how NE dynein recruitment is cell-cycle regulated and identify the trigger mechanism for apical nuclear migration in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial morphological and ultrastructural changes occur during apoptosis and autophagy, but whether they are relevant in vivo for tissue response to damage is unclear. Here we investigate the role of the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1)-dependent cristae remodeling pathway in vivo and provide evidence that it regulates the response of multiple tissues to apoptotic, necrotic, and atrophic stimuli. Genetic inhibition of the cristae remodeling pathway in vivo does not affect development, but protects mice from denervation-induced muscular atrophy, ischemic heart and brain damage, as well as hepatocellular apoptosis. Mechanistically, OPA1-dependent mitochondrial cristae stabilization increases mitochondrial respiratory efficiency and blunts mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, and reactive oxygen species production. Our results indicate that the OPA1-dependent cristae remodeling pathway is a fundamental, targetable determinant of tissue damage in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular signatures specific to particular tumor types are required to design treatments for resistant tumors. However, it remains unclear whether tumors and corresponding cell lines used for drug development share such signatures. We developed similarity core analysis (SCA), a universal and unsupervised computational framework for extracting core molecular features common to tumors and cell lines. We applied SCA to mRNA/miRNA expression data from various sources, comparing melanoma cell lines and metastases. The signature obtained was associated with phenotypic characteristics in vitro, and the core genes CAPN3 and TRIM63 were implicated in melanoma cell migration/invasion. About 90% of the melanoma signature genes belong to an intrinsic network of transcription factors governing neural development (TFAP2A, DLX2, ALX1, MITF, PAX3, SOX10, LEF1, and GAS7) and miRNAs (211-5p, 221-3p, and 10a-5p). The SCA signature effectively discriminated between two subpopulations of melanoma patients differing in overall survival, and classified MEKi/BRAFi-resistant and -sensitive melanoma cell lines.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein A-I and A-IV are protein constituents of high-density lipoproteins although their functional difference in lipoprotein metabolism is still unclear. To compare anti-atherogenic properties between apoA-I and apoA-4, we characterized both proteins in lipid-free and lipid-bound state. In lipid-free state, apoA4 showed two distinct bands, around 78 and 67 Å on native gel electrophoresis, while apoA-I showed scattered band pattern less than 71 Å. In reconstituted HDL (rHDL) state, apoA-4 showed three major bands around 101 Å and 113 Å, while apoA-I-rHDL showed almost single band around 98 Å size. Lipid-free apoA-I showed 2.9-fold higher phospholipid binding ability than apoA-4. In lipid-free state, BS3-crosslinking revealed that apoA-4 showed less multimerization tendency upto dimer, while apoA-I showed pentamerization. In rHDL state (95:1), apoA-4 was existed as dimer as like as apoA-I. With higher phospholipid content (255:1), five apoA-I and three apoA-4 were required to the bigger rHDL formation. Regardless of particle size, apoA-I-rHDL showed superior LCAT activation ability than apoA-4-rHDL. Uptake of acetylated LDL was inhibited by apoA-I in both lipid-free and lipid-bound state, while apoA-4 inhibited it only lipid-free state. ApoA-4 showed less anti-atherogenic activity with more sensitivity to glycation. In conclusion, apoA-4 showed inferior physiological functions in lipid-bound state, compared with those of apoA-I, to induce more pro-atherosclerotic properties.

Abstract: Summary
Many genes that affect replicative lifespan (RLS) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also affect aging in other organisms such as C. elegans and M. musculus. We performed a systematic analysis of yeast RLS in a set of 4,698 viable single-gene deletion strains. Multiple functional gene clusters were identified, and full genome-to-genome comparison demonstrated a significant conservation in longevity pathways between yeast and C. elegans. Among the mechanisms of aging identified, deletion of tRNA exporter LOS1 robustly extended lifespan. Dietary restriction (DR) and inhibition of mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) exclude Los1 from the nucleus in a Rad53-dependent manner. Moreover, lifespan extension from deletion of LOS1 is nonadditive with DR or mTOR inhibition, and results in Gcn4 transcription factor activation. Thus, the DNA damage response and mTOR converge on Los1-mediated nuclear tRNA export to regulate Gcn4 activity and aging.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane trafficking of integrins plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and migration. How endocytosed integrins are targeted either for recycling or lysosomal delivery is not fully understood. Here, we show that fibronectin (FN) binding to α5β1 integrin triggers ubiquitination and internalization of the receptor complex. Acidification facilitates FN dissociation from integrin α5β1 in vitro and in early endosomes, promoting receptor complex deubiquitination by the USP9x and recycling to the cell surface. Depending on residual ligand occupancy of receptors, some α5β1 integrins remain ubiquitinated and are captured by ESCRT-0/I, containing histidine domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (HD-PTP) and ubiquitin-associated protein 1 (UBAP1), and are directed for lysosomal proteolysis, limiting receptor downstream signaling and cell migration. Thus, HD-PTP or UBAP1 depletion confers a pro-invasive phenotype. Thus, pH-dependent FN-integrin dissociation and deubiquitination of the activated integrin α5β1 are required for receptor resensitization and cell migration, representing potential targets to modulate tumor invasiveness.

Abstract: Summary
Functional brain-imaging techniques used in humans and animals, such as functional MRI and intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging, are thought to largely rely on neurovascular coupling and hemodynamic responses. Here, taking advantage of the well-described micro-architecture of the mouse olfactory bulb, we dissected the nature of odor-evoked IOSs. Using in vivo pharmacology in transgenic mouse lines reporting activity in different cell types, we show that parenchymal IOSs are largely independent of neurotransmitter release and neurovascular coupling. Furthermore, our results suggest that odor-evoked parenchymal IOSs originate from changes in light scattering of olfactory sensory neuron axons, mostly due to water movement following action potential propagation. Our study sheds light on a direct correlate of neuronal activity, which may be used for large-scale functional brain imaging.

Abstract: Summary
Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) mediates nonshivering thermogenesis and, upon cold exposure, is induced in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (iWAT). Here, by high-throughput screening using the UCP1 promoter, we identify Zfp516 as a transcriptional activator of UCP1 as well as PGC1α, thereby promoting a BAT program. Zfp516 itself is induced by cold and sympathetic stimulation through the cAMP-CREB/ATF2 pathway. Zfp516 directly binds to the proximal region of the UCP1 promoter, not to the enhancer region where other transcription factors bind, and interacts with PRDM16 to activate the UCP1 promoter. Although ablation of Zfp516 causes embryonic lethality, knockout embryos still show drastically reduced BAT mass. Overexpression of Zfp516 in adipose tissue promotes browning of iWAT even at room temperature, increasing body temperature and energy expenditure and preventing diet-induced obesity. Zfp516 may represent a future target for obesity therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Resistance to chemotherapy represents a major obstacle for long-term remission, and effective strategies to overcome drug resistance would have significant clinical impact. We report that recurrent ovarian carcinomas after paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment have higher levels of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and phospho-SYK. In vitro, paclitaxel-resistant cells expressed higher SYK, and the ratio of phospho-SYK/SYK positively associated with paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Inactivation of SYK by inhibitors or gene knockdown sensitized paclitaxel cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the phosphotyrosine proteome in paclitaxel-resistant tumor cells revealed that SYK phosphorylates tubulins and microtubule-associated proteins. Inhibition of SYK enhanced microtubule stability in paclitaxel-resistant tumor cells that were otherwise insensitive. Thus, targeting SYK pathway is a promising strategy to enhance paclitaxel response.

Abstract: Summary
Neuropeptides, representing the largest class of neuromodulators, commonly signal by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). While the neuropeptide repertoire of several metazoans has been characterized, many GPCRs are orphans. Here, we develop a strategy to identify GPCR-peptide pairs using combinatorial screening with complex peptide mixtures. We screened 126 neuropeptides against 87 GPCRs of the annelid Platynereis and identified ligands for 19 receptors. We assigned many GPCRs to known families and identified conserved families of achatin, FMRFamide, RGWamide, FLamide, and elevenin receptors. We also identified a ligand for the Platynereis ortholog of vertebrate thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors, revealing the ancient origin of TRH-receptor signaling. We predicted ligands for several metazoan GPCRs and tested predicted achatin receptors. These receptors were specifically activated by an achatin D-peptide, revealing a conserved mode of activation. Our work establishes an important resource and provides information about the complexity of peptidergic signaling in the urbilaterian.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted therapies designed to exploit specific molecular pathways in aggressive cancers are an exciting area of current research. Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) mutations such as the t(4;11) translocation cause aggressive leukemias that are refractory to conventional treatment. The t(4;11) translocation produces an MLL/AF4 fusion protein that activates key target genes through both epigenetic and transcriptional elongation mechanisms. In this study, we show that t(4;11) patient cells express high levels of BCL-2 and are highly sensitive to treatment with the BCL-2-specific BH3 mimetic ABT-199. We demonstrate that MLL/AF4 specifically upregulates the BCL-2 gene but not other BCL-2 family members via DOT1L-mediated H3K79me2/3. We use this information to show that a t(4;11) cell line is sensitive to a combination of ABT-199 and DOT1L inhibitors. In addition, ABT-199 synergizes with standard induction-type therapy in a xenotransplant model, advocating for the introduction of ABT-199 into therapeutic regimens for MLL-rearranged leukemias.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of angiogenesis and thus contributes to many vasoproliferative retinopathies including retinopathy of prematurity. Based on the importance of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels in VEGF signaling, we firstly evaluated the expression of TRPC channels in mouse retina by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. All seven TRPC channels were expressed in mouse retina. TRPC4 channels were chosen for further analysis based on their upregulation on hypoxic retina according to the GEO database under the identifier GSE19886. Interestingly, TRPC4 suppression by intravitreal injection of siRNA against mTRPC4 significantly inhibited retinal neovascularization. To further investigate the effect of TRPC4 suppression on neovascularization, human retina microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) that are responsible for initiating neovascularization in response to increased VEGF in OIR retina were transfected with siRNA against TRPC4. As we have expected, suppression of TRPC4 effectively inhibited VEGF-induced migration and tube formation as well. Further evaluation on VEGF signaling pathway by western blot analysis of signaling molecules discovered that VEGF-induced activation of ERK, p38 MAPK and AKT signaling pathways were inhibited by suppression of TRPC4. These findings suggest that suppression of TRPC4 could be an alternative therapeutic option for VEGF-induced retinal neovascularization.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of pancreas, liver, and intestine from a common pool of progenitors in the foregut endoderm requires the establishment of organ boundaries. How dorsal foregut progenitors activate pancreatic genes and evade the intestinal lineage choice remains unclear. Here, we identify Pdx1 and Sox9 as cooperative inducers of a gene regulatory network that distinguishes the pancreatic from the intestinal lineage. Genetic studies demonstrate dual and cooperative functions for Pdx1 and Sox9 in pancreatic lineage induction and repression of the intestinal lineage choice. Pdx1 and Sox9 bind to regulatory sequences near pancreatic and intestinal differentiation genes and jointly regulate their expression, revealing direct cooperative roles for Pdx1 and Sox9 in gene activation and repression. Our study identifies Pdx1 and Sox9 as important regulators of a transcription factor network that initiates pancreatic fate and sheds light on the gene regulatory circuitry that governs the development of distinct organs from multi-lineage-competent foregut progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model organism for replicative aging studies; however, conventional lifespan measurement platforms have several limitations. Here, we present a microfluidics platform that facilitates simultaneous lifespan and gene expression measurements of aging yeast cells. Our multiplexed high-throughput platform offers the capability to perform independent lifespan experiments using different yeast strains or growth media. Using this platform in minimal media environments containing glucose, we measured the full lifespan of individual yeast cells in wild-type and canonical gene deletion backgrounds. Compared to glucose, in galactose we observed a 16.8% decrease in replicative lifespan accompanied by an ∼2-fold increase in single-cell oxidative stress levels reported by PSOD1-mCherry. Using PGAL1-YFP to measure the activity of the bistable galactose network, we saw that OFF and ON cells are similar in their lifespan. Our work shows that aging cells are committed to a single phenotypic state throughout their lifespan.

Abstract: Summary
The small GTPase Rab11 dynamically changes its location to regulate various cellular processes such as endocytic recycling, secretion, and cytokinesis. However, our knowledge of its upstream regulators is still limited. Here, we identify the RAB-11-interacting protein-1 (REI-1) as a unique family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for RAB-11 in Caenorhabditis elegans. Although REI-1 and its human homolog SH3-binding protein 5 do not contain any known Rab-GEF domains, they exhibited strong GEF activity toward Rab11 in vitro. In C. elegans, REI-1 is expressed in the germline and co-localizes with RAB-11 on the late-Golgi membranes. The loss of REI-1 specifically impaired the targeting of RAB-11 to the late-Golgi compartment and the recycling endosomes in embryos and further reduced the RAB-11 distribution to the cleavage furrow, which resulted in cytokinesis delay. These results suggest that REI-1 is a GEF specifically regulating the RAB-11 localization and functions in early embryos.

Abstract: Summary
DNA is wrapped in a left-handed fashion around histone octasomes containing the centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A. However, DNA topology studies have suggested that DNA is wrapped in a right-handed manner around the CENP-A nucleosome that occupies the yeast point centromere. Here, we determine the DNA linking number difference (ΔLk) stabilized by the yeast centromere and the contribution of the centromere determining elements (CDEI, CDEII, and CDEIII). We show that the intrinsic architecture of the yeast centromere stabilizes +0.6 units of ΔLk. This topology depends on the integrity of CDEII and CDEIII, but it is independent of cbf1 binding to CDEI and of the variable length of CDEII. These findings suggest that the interaction of the CBF3 complex with CDEIII and a distal CDEII segment configures a right-handed DNA loop that excludes CDEI. This loop is then occupied by a CENP-A histone complex, which does not have to be inherently right-handed.

Abstract: Neurones in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus possess intrinsic osmosensing mechanisms, which are lost in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (Trpv1)-knock-out mice. The molecular nature of the osmosensory mechanism in SON neurones is believed to be associated with the N-terminal splice variant of Trpv1, although their entire molecular structures have not been hitherto identified. In this study, we sought for TRPV1-related molecules and their function in the rat SON. We performed RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry to detect TRPV1-related molecules in the SON, and patch-clamp and imaging of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) to measure responses to osmolality changes and TRPV-related drugs in acutely dissociated SON neurones of rats. RT-PCR analysis revealed full-length Trpv1 and a new N-terminal splice variant, Trpv1_SON (LC008303) in the SON. Positive immunostaining was observed using an antibody against the N-terminal portion of TRPV1 in arginine vasopressin (AVP)-immunoreactive neurones, but not in oxytocin (OT)-immunoreactive neurones. Approximately 20% of SON neurones responded to mannitol (50mM) with increased action potential firing, inward currents, and [Ca2+]i mobilization. Mannitol-induced responses were observed in AVP neurones isolated from AVP-eGFP transgenic rats and identified by GFP fluorescence, but not in OT neurones isolated from OT-mRFP transgenic rats and identified by RFP fluorescence. The mannitol-induced [Ca2+]i responses were reversibly blocked by the non-selective TRPV antagonist, ruthenium red (10μM) and the TRPV1 antagonists, capsazepine (10μM) and BCTC (10μM). Although the TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin (100nM) evoked no response at room temperature, it triggered cationic currents and [Ca2+]i elevation when the temperature was increased to 36°C. These results suggest that AVP neurones in the rat SON possess functional full-length TRPV1. Moreover, differences between the responses to capsaicin or hyperosmolality obtained in rat SON neurones and those obtained from dorsal root ganglion neurones or TRPV1-expressing cells indicate that the osmoreceptor expressed in the SON may be a heteromultimer in which TRPV1 is co-assembled with some other, yet unidentified, molecules.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic potential arises in mammalian embryos before adult-repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). At embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), we show the first murine definitive erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) have an immunophenotype distinct from primitive hematopoietic progenitors, maturing megakaryocytes and macrophages, and rare B cell potential. EMPs emerge in the yolk sac with erythroid and broad myeloid, but not lymphoid, potential. EMPs migrate to the fetal liver and rapidly differentiate, including production of circulating neutrophils by E11.5. Although the surface markers, transcription factors, and lineage potential associated with EMPs overlap with those found in adult definitive hematopoiesis, they are present in unique combinations or proportions that result in a specialized definitive embryonic progenitor. Furthermore, we find that embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived hematopoiesis recapitulates early yolk sac hematopoiesis, including primitive, EMP, and rare B cell potential. EMPs do not have long-term potential when transplanted in immunocompromised adults, but they can provide transient adult-like RBC reconstitution.

Abstract: Summary
Pericytes are critical for cerebrovascular maturation and development of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), but their role in maintenance of the adult BBB, and how CNS pericytes differ from those of other tissues, is less well understood. We show that the forkhead transcription factor Foxf2 is specifically expressed in pericytes of the brain and that Foxf2−/− embryos develop intracranial hemorrhage, perivascular edema, thinning of the vascular basal lamina, an increase of luminal endothelial caveolae, and a leaky BBB. Foxf2−/− brain pericytes were more numerous, proliferated faster, and expressed significantly less Pdgfrβ. Tgfβ-Smad2/3 signaling was attenuated, whereas phosphorylation of Smad1/5 and p38 were enhanced. Tgfβ pathway components, including Tgfβ2, Tgfβr2, Alk5, and integrins αVβ8, were reduced. Foxf2 inactivation in adults resulted in BBB breakdown, endothelial thickening, and increased trans-endothelial vesicular transport. On the basis of these results, FOXF2 emerges as an interesting candidate locus for stroke susceptibility in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Polarization of cells into a protrusive front and a retracting cell body is the hallmark of mesenchymal-like cell migration. Many mRNAs are localized to protrusions, but it is unclear to what degree mRNA localization contributes toward protrusion formation. We performed global quantitative analysis of the distributions of mRNAs, proteins, and translation rates between protrusions and the cell body by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative proteomics. Our results reveal local translation as a key determinant of protein localization to protrusions. Accordingly, inhibition of local translation destabilizes protrusions and inhibits mesenchymal-like morphology. Interestingly, many mRNAs localized to protrusions are translationally repressed. Specific cis-regulatory elements within mRNA UTRs define whether mRNAs are locally translated or repressed. Finally, RNAi screening of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) enriched in protrusions revealed trans-regulators of localized translation that are functionally important for protrusions. We propose that by deciphering the localized mRNA UTR code, these proteins regulate protrusion stability and mesenchymal-like morphology.

Abstract: In this study, the reproductive biology of female freshwater crab Sodhiana iranica, oogenesis and ovarian development were described. An H-shaped ovary consisting of a pair of long ovarian sacs connected by a narrow bridge tube was located in the cephalothorax on the dorsal side of the stomach. Females at different stages of ovarian development were anesthetized and their ovaries were removed, photographed, fixed, and processed for histological examination. Based on the light microscopic observations of cells’ sizes, chromatin patterns, and amount of lipid vesicles, the female germ cells could be classified into seven different stages: (1) oogonia (Oog), (2) primary oocytes (pOc), (3) early previtellogenic oocyte (Oc1), (4) late previtellogenic oocyte(Oc2), (5) early vitellogenic oocyte (Oc3), (6) late vitellogenic oocyte (Oc4), and (7) mature oocyte (mOc). Oog are small oval-shaped cells with irregular-shaped nuclei. Oog undergo first meiotic division to become primary oocytes. The primary oocytes are small oval-shaped cells with large nuclei. The secondary oocytes derived from 2nd meiosis and comprise five steps. Four ovarian development stages were found for females based on the number and types of oocytes present in each stage: spent I (Spent), II (Proliferative) and III (Premature) and stage IV (Mature). The ovaries, macroscopically, varied in size and color during each developmental stage and, microscopically, the ovarian stages differed in proportion oogonia, and the secondary oocytes. During ovarian stage I, ovary contains primarily oogonia, primary oocytes and Oc1. In stage II, contains mainly Oc1, Oc2, and Oc3, while in stage III the predominant cells are Oc4. Mature oocytes appear synchronously in stage IV.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) serves as a central experimental technique in epigenetics research, yet there are serious drawbacks: it is a relative measurement, which untethered to any external scale obscures fair comparison among experiments; it employs antibody reagents that have differing affinities and specificities for target epitopes that vary in abundance; and it is frequently not reproducible. To address these problems, we developed Internal Standard Calibrated ChIP (ICeChIP), wherein a native chromatin sample is spiked with nucleosomes reconstituted from recombinant and semisynthetic histones on barcoded DNA prior to immunoprecipitation. ICeChIP measures local histone modification densities on a biologically meaningful scale, enabling unbiased trans-experimental comparisons, and reveals unique insight into the nature of bivalent domains. This technology provides in situ assessment of the immunoprecipitation step, accommodating for many experimental pitfalls as well as providing a critical examination of untested assumptions inherent to conventional ChIP.

Abstract: Summary
Equal mitotic chromosome segregation is critical for genome integrity and is monitored by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). We have previously shown that the consensus phosphorylation motif of the essential SAC kinase Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) is very similar to that of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). This prompted us to ask whether human Plk1 cooperates with Mps1 in SAC signaling. Here, we demonstrate that Plk1 promotes checkpoint signaling at kinetochores through the phosphorylation of at least two Mps1 substrates, including KNL-1 and Mps1 itself. As a result, Plk1 activity enhances Mps1 catalytic activity as well as the recruitment of the SAC components Mad1:C-Mad2 and Bub3:BubR1 to kinetochores. We conclude that Plk1 strengthens the robustness of SAC establishment at the onset of mitosis and supports SAC maintenance during prolonged mitotic arrest.

A Long Non-coding RNA, LncMyoD, Regulates Skeletal Muscle Differentiation by Blocking IMP2-Mediated mRNA Translation,

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) represent a new class of regulators of stem cells. However, the roles of LncRNAs in stem cell maintenance and myogenesis remain largely unexamined. For this study, hundreds of intergenic LncRNAs were identified that are expressed in myoblasts and regulated during differentiation. One of these LncRNAs, termed LncMyoD, is encoded next to the Myod gene and is directly activated by MyoD during myoblast differentiation. Knockdown of LncMyoD strongly inhibits terminal muscle differentiation, largely due to a failure to exit the cell cycle. LncMyoD directly binds to IGF2-mRNA-binding protein 2 (IMP2) and negatively regulates IMP2-mediated translation of proliferation genes such as N-Ras and c-Myc. While the RNA sequence of LncMyoD is not well conserved between human and mouse, its locus, gene structure, and function are preserved. The MyoD-LncMyoD-IMP2 pathway elucidates a mechanism as to how MyoD blocks proliferation to create a permissive state for differentiation.

Abstract: Cyclophosphamide (CP), an alkylating antineoplastic agent is widely used in the treatment of solid tumors and B-cell malignant disease. It is known to cause urinary bladder damage due to inducing oxidative stress. Moringa oleifera (Mof) is commonly known as drumstick tree. Moringa leaves have been reported to be a rich source of β-carotene, protein, vitamin C, calcium, and potassium. It acts as a good source of natural antioxidants; due to the presence of various types of antioxidant compounds such as ascorbic acid, flavonoids, phenolics and carotenoids. The aim of this work was to test the possible antioxidant protective effects of M. oleifera leaves against CP induced urinary bladder toxicity in rats. Female Wister albino rats were divided into 4 groups. Group I served as control, received orally normal saline, group II received a single dose CP 100mg/kg intraperitoneally, group III and VI both received orally hydroethanolic extract of Mof; 500mg/kg and 1000mg/kg respectively daily for a week, 1h before and 4h after CP administration. Rats were sacrificed 24h after CP injection. The bladder was removed, sectioned, and subjected to light, transition electron microscopic studies, and biochemical studies (measuring the parameter of lipid peroxidation; malondialdehyde along with the activities of the antioxidant enzyme reduced glutathione). The bladders of CP treated rats showed ulcered mucosa, edematous, hemorrhagic, and fibrotic submucosa by light microscopy. Ultrastructure observation showed; losing large areas of uroepithelium, extended intercellular gaps, junction complexes were affected as well as damage of mitochondria in the form of swelling and destruction of cristae. Biochemical analysis showed significant elevation of malondialdhyde, while reduced glutathione activity was significantly lowered. From the results obtained in this work, we can say that Moringa leaves play an important role in ameliorating and protecting the bladder from CP toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Catecholamines promote lipolysis both in brown and white adipocytes, whereas the same stimuli preferentially activate thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Molecular mechanisms for the adipose-selective activation of thermogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we employed quantitative phosphoproteomics to map global and temporal phosphorylation profiles in brown, beige, and white adipocytes under β3-adrenenoceptor activation and identified kinases responsible for the adipose-selective phosphorylation profiles. We found that casein kinase2 (CK2) activity is preferentially higher in white adipocytes than brown/beige adipocytes. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of CK2 in white adipocytes activates the thermogenic program in response to cAMP stimuli. Such activation is largely through reduced CK2-mediated phosphorylation of class I HDACs. Notably, inhibition of CK2 promotes beige adipocyte biogenesis and leads to an increase in whole-body energy expenditure and ameliorates diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. These results indicate that CK2 is a plausible target to rewire the β3-adrenenoceptor signaling cascade that promotes thermogenesis in adipocytes.

Abstract: Summary
In polarized cells or cells with complex geometry, clustering of plasma-membrane (PM) ion channels is an effective mechanism for eliciting spatially restricted signals. However, channel clustering is also seen in cells with relatively simple topology, suggesting it fulfills a more fundamental role in cell biology than simply orchestrating compartmentalized responses. Here, we have compared the ability of store-operated Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels confined to PM microdomains with a similar number of dispersed CRAC channels to activate transcription factors, which subsequently increase nuclear gene expression. For similar levels of channel activity, we find that channel confinement is considerably more effective in stimulating gene expression. Our results identify a long-range signaling advantage to the tight evolutionary conservation of channel clustering and reveal that CRAC channel aggregation increases the strength, fidelity, and reliability of the general process of excitation-transcription coupling.

Abstract: Summary
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of 26- to 32-nt non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), function in germline development, transposon silencing, and epigenetic regulation. We performed deep sequencing and annotation of untreated and periodate-treated small RNA cDNA libraries from human fetal and adult germline and reference somatic tissues. This revealed abundant piRNAs originating from 150 piRNA-encoding genes, including some exhibiting gender-specific expression, in fetal ovary and adult testis—developmental periods coinciding with mitotic cell divisions expanding fetal germ cells prior to meiotic divisions. The absence of reads mapping uniquely to annotated piRNA genes demonstrated their paucity in fetal testis and adult ovary and absence in somatic tissues. We curated human piRNA-expressing regions and defined their precise borders and observed piRNA-guided cleavage of transcripts antisense to some piRNA-producing genes. This study provides insights into sex-specific mammalian piRNA expression and function and serves as a reference for human piRNA analysis and annotation.

Abstract: Summary
The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) as amyloid fibrils and toxic oligomers is an important step in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, there are numerous potentially toxic oligomers and little is known about their neurological effects when generated in the living brain. Here we show that Aβ oligomers can be assigned to one of at least two classes (type 1 and type 2) based on their temporal, spatial, and structural relationships to amyloid fibrils. The type 2 oligomers are related to amyloid fibrils and represent the majority of oligomers generated in vivo, but they remain confined to the vicinity of amyloid plaques and do not impair cognition at levels relevant to AD. Type 1 oligomers are unrelated to amyloid fibrils and may have greater potential to cause global neural dysfunction in AD because they are dispersed. These results refine our understanding of the pathogenicity of Aβ oligomers in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Recent findings have identified highly transcribed genes as a source of genome instability; however, the degree to which large-scale shifts in transcriptional activity cause DNA damage was not known. One example of a large-scale shift in transcriptional activity occurs during development, when maternal regulators are destroyed and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs. Here, we show that ZGA triggers widespread chromosome damage in the primordial germ cells of the nematode C. elegans. We show that ZGA-induced DNA damage activates a checkpoint response, the damage is repaired by factors required for inter-sister homologous recombination, and topoisomerase II plays a role in generating the damage. These findings identify ZGA as a source of intrinsic genome instability in the germline and suggest that genome destabilization may be a general consequence of extreme shifts in cellular transcriptional load.

Abstract: Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the translation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) involved in the growth and development of a variety of cells, including primordial germ cells (PGCs) which play an essential role in germ cell development. However, the target mRNAs and the regulatory networks influenced by miRNAs in PGCs remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate a novel miRNAs control PGC development through targeting mRNAs involved in various cellular pathways. We reveal the PGC-enriched expression patterns of nine miRNAs, including miR-10b, -18a, -93, -106b, -126-3p, -127, -181a, -181b, and -301, using miRNA expression analysis along with mRNA microarray analysis in PGCs, embryonic gonads, and postnatal testes. These miRNAs are highly expressed in PGCs, as demonstrated by Northern blotting, miRNA in situ hybridization assay, and miRNA qPCR analysis. This integrative study utilizing mRNA microarray analysis and miRNA target prediction demonstrates the regulatory networks through which these miRNAs regulate their potential target genes during PGC development. The elucidated networks of miRNAs disclose a coordinated molecular mechanism by which these miRNAs regulate distinct cellular pathways in PGCs that determine germ cell development.

Abstract: Summary
MicroDNAs are <400-base extrachromosomal circles found in mammalian cells. Tens of thousands of microDNAs have been found in all tissue types, including sperm. MicroDNAs arise preferentially from areas with high gene density, GC content, and exon density from promoters with activating chromatin modifications and in sperm from the 5′-UTR of full-length LINE-1 elements, but are depleted from lamin-associated heterochromatin. Analysis of microDNAs from a set of human cancer cell lines revealed lineage-specific patterns of microDNA origins. A survey of microDNAs from chicken cells defective in various DNA repair proteins reveals that homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining repair pathways are not required for microDNA production. Deletion of the MSH3 DNA mismatch repair protein results in a significant decrease in microDNA abundance, specifically from non-CpG genomic regions. Thus, microDNAs arise as part of normal cellular physiology—either from DNA breaks associated with RNA metabolism or from replication slippage followed by mismatch repair.

Abstract: Summary
Basal-like breast cancers (BLBCs) are aggressive, and their drivers are unclear. We have found that wild-type N-RAS is overexpressed in BLBCs but not in other breast cancer subtypes. Repressing N-RAS inhibits transformation and tumor growth, whereas overexpression enhances these processes even in preinvasive BLBC cells. We identified N-Ras-responsive genes, most of which encode chemokines; e.g., IL8. Expression levels of these chemokines and N-RAS in tumors correlate with outcome. N-Ras, but not K-Ras, induces IL-8 by binding and activating the cytoplasmic pool of JAK2; IL-8 then acts on both the cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts. Thus, BLBC progression is promoted by increasing activities of wild-type N-Ras, which mediates autocrine/paracrine signaling that can influence both cancer and stroma cells.

Abstract: Summary
The Piwi-piRNA pathway is well known for its germline function, yet its somatic role remains elusive. We show here that Piwi is required autonomously not only for germline stem cell (GSC) but also for somatic cyst stem cell (CySC) maintenance in the Drosophila testis. Reducing Piwi activity in the testis caused defects in CySC differentiation. Accompanying this, GSC daughters expanded beyond the vicinity of the hub but failed to differentiate further. Moreover, Piwi deficient in nuclear localization caused similar defects in somatic and germ cell differentiation, which was rescued by somatic Piwi expression. To explore the underlying molecular mechanism, we identified Piwi-bound piRNAs that uniquely map to a gene key for gonadal development, Fasciclin 3, and demonstrate that Piwi regulates its expression in somatic cyst cells. Our work reveals the cell-autonomous function of Piwi in both somatic and germline stem cell types, with somatic function possibly via its epigenetic mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key regulator of energy balance; however, its underlying mechanism remains unknown. By analyzing BDNF-expressing neurons in paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH), we have uncovered neural circuits that control energy balance. The Bdnf gene in the PVH was mostly expressed in previously undefined neurons, and its deletion caused hyperphagia, reduced locomotor activity, impaired thermogenesis, and severe obesity. Hyperphagia and reduced locomotor activity were associated with Bdnf deletion in anterior PVH, whereas BDNF neurons in medial and posterior PVH drive thermogenesis by projecting to spinal cord and forming polysynaptic connections to brown adipose tissues. Furthermore, BDNF expression in the PVH was increased in response to cold exposure, and its ablation caused atrophy of sympathetic preganglionic neurons. Thus, BDNF neurons in anterior PVH control energy intake and locomotor activity, whereas those in medial and posterior PVH promote thermogenesis by releasing BDNF into spinal cord to boost sympathetic outflow.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-educated blood platelets (TEPs) are implicated as central players in the systemic and local responses to tumor growth, thereby altering their RNA profile. We determined the diagnostic potential of TEPs by mRNA sequencing of 283 platelet samples. We distinguished 228 patients with localized and metastasized tumors from 55 healthy individuals with 96% accuracy. Across six different tumor types, the location of the primary tumor was correctly identified with 71% accuracy. Also, MET or HER2-positive, and mutant KRAS, EGFR, or PIK3CA tumors were accurately distinguished using surrogate TEP mRNA profiles. Our results indicate that blood platelets provide a valuable platform for pan-cancer, multiclass cancer, and companion diagnostics, possibly enabling clinical advances in blood-based “liquid biopsies”.

Abstract: Summary
Migrating fibroblasts undergo contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), a process that was discovered five decades ago and still is not fully understood at the molecular level. We identify the Slit2-Robo4-srGAP2 signaling network as a key regulator of CIL in fibroblasts. CIL involves highly dynamic contact protrusions with a specialized actin cytoskeleton that stochastically explore cell-cell overlaps between colliding fibroblasts. A membrane curvature-sensing F-BAR domain pre-localizes srGAP2 to protruding edges and terminates their extension phase in response to cell collision. A FRET-based biosensor reveals that Rac1 activity is focused in a band at the tip of contact protrusions, in contrast to the broad activation gradient in contact-free protrusions. SrGAP2 specifically controls the duration of Rac1 activity in contact protrusions, but not in contact-free protrusions. We propose that srGAP2 integrates cell edge curvature and Slit-Robo-mediated repulsive cues to fine-tune Rac1 activation dynamics in contact protrusions to spatiotemporally coordinate CIL.

Abstract: Summary
Period (PER) protein phosphorylation is a critical regulator of circadian period, yet an integrated understanding of the role and interaction between phosphorylation sites that can both increase and decrease PER2 stability remains elusive. Here, we propose a phosphoswitch model, where two competing phosphorylation sites determine whether PER2 has a fast or slow degradation rate. This mathematical model accurately reproduces the three-stage degradation kinetics of endogenous PER2. We predict and demonstrate that the phosphoswitch is intrinsically temperature sensitive, slowing down PER2 degradation as a result of faster reactions at higher temperatures. The phosphoswitch provides a biochemical mechanism for circadian temperature compensation of circadian period. This phosphoswitch additionally explains the phenotype of Familial Advanced Sleep Phase (FASP) and CK1εtau genetic circadian rhythm disorders, metabolic control of PER2 stability, and how drugs that inhibit CK1 alter period. The phosphoswitch provides a general mechanism to integrate diverse stimuli to regulate circadian period.

Abstract: Summary
Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of end-stage kidney disease. Characterized by progressive microvascular disease, most efforts have focused on injury to the glomerular endothelium. Recent work has suggested a role for the podocyte, a highly specialized component of the glomerular filtration barrier. Here, we demonstrate that the Drosophila nephrocyte, a cell analogous to the mammalian podocyte, displays defects that phenocopy aspects of diabetic nephropathy in animals fed chronic high dietary sucrose. Through functional studies, we identify an OGT-Polycomb-Knot-Sns pathway that links dietary sucrose to loss of the Nephrin ortholog Sns. Reducing OGT through genetic or drug means is sufficient to rescue loss of Sns, leading to overall extension of lifespan. We demonstrate upregulation of the Knot ortholog EBF2 in glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients and a mouse ob/ob diabetes model. Furthermore, we demonstrate rescue of Nephrin expression and cell viability in ebf2−/− primary podocytes cultured in high glucose.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagic turnover of intracellular constituents is critical for cellular housekeeping, nutrient recycling, and various aspects of growth and development in eukaryotes. Here we show that autophagy impacts the other major degradative route involving the ubiquitin-proteasome system by eliminating 26S proteasomes, a process we termed proteaphagy. Using Arabidopsis proteasomes tagged with GFP, we observed their deposition into vacuoles via a route requiring components of the autophagy machinery. This transport can be initiated separately by nitrogen starvation and chemical or genetic inhibition of the proteasome, implying distinct induction mechanisms. Proteasome inhibition stimulates comprehensive ubiquitylation of the complex, with the ensuing proteaphagy requiring the proteasome subunit RPN10, which can simultaneously bind both ATG8 and ubiquitin. Collectively, we propose that Arabidopsis RPN10 acts as a selective autophagy receptor that targets inactive 26S proteasomes by concurrent interactions with ubiquitylated proteasome subunits/targets and lipidated ATG8 lining the enveloping autophagic membranes.

Abstract: Summary
Engineering commensal organisms for challenging applications, such as modulating the gut ecosystem, is hampered by the lack of genetic parts. Here, we describe promoters, ribosome-binding sites, and inducible systems for use in the commensal bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prevalent and stable resident of the human gut. We achieve up to 10,000-fold range in constitutive gene expression and 100-fold regulation of gene expression with inducible promoters and use these parts to record DNA-encoded memory in the genome. We use CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) for regulated knockdown of recombinant and endogenous gene expression to alter the metabolic capacity of B. thetaiotaomicron and its resistance to antimicrobial peptides. Finally, we show that inducible CRISPRi and recombinase systems can function in B. thetaiotaomicron colonizing the mouse gut. These results provide a blueprint for engineering new chassis and a resource to engineer Bacteroides for surveillance of or therapeutic delivery to the gut microbiome.

Abstract: Summary
The integrity of chromatin, which provides a dynamic template for all DNA-related processes in eukaryotes, is maintained through replication-dependent and -independent assembly pathways. To address the role of histone deposition in the absence of DNA replication, we deleted the H3.3 chaperone Hira in developing mouse oocytes. We show that chromatin of non-replicative developing oocytes is dynamic and that lack of continuous H3.3/H4 deposition alters chromatin structure, resulting in increased DNase I sensitivity, the accumulation of DNA damage, and a severe fertility phenotype. On the molecular level, abnormal chromatin structure leads to a dramatic decrease in the dynamic range of gene expression, the appearance of spurious transcripts, and inefficient de novo DNA methylation. Our study thus unequivocally shows the importance of continuous histone replacement and chromatin homeostasis for transcriptional regulation and normal developmental progression in a non-replicative system in vivo.

Abstract: A new bovine cell line was developed from tumor biopsy material of rectum obtained from clinical case of 7 years old cattle with tumor mass obliterating the rectal opening. Histopathology of tumor revealed scattered stellate cells arranged singly or in clusters in loose mucinous ground substance, simulating myxoma. The cells obtained from tumor mass have been cultured for more than 36 months in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The population doubling time of this cell line was about 20.64h. The cytogenetic analysis revealed several chromosomal abnormalities with bizarre karyotype. The origin of the cell line was confirmed by PCR amplification of 1086bp fragment of 16s rRNA using bovine species specific primers. The new cell line would act as in vitro model to study many aspect of cancer biology such as tumor development, differentiation and therapeutics regimen to combat cancer.

Abstract: In the interaction between plants and pathogens, carbon (C) resources provide energy and C skeletons to maintain, among many functions, the plant immune system. However, variations in C availability on pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI) have not been systematically examined. Here, three types of starch mutants with enhanced susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 hrcC were examined for PTI. In a dark period-dependent manner, the mutants showed compromised induction of a PTI marker, and callose accumulation in response to the bacterial PAMP flagellin, flg22. In combination with weakened PTI responses in wild type by inhibition of the TCA cycle, the experiments determined the necessity of C-derived energy in establishing PTI. Global gene expression analyses identified flg22 responsive genes displaying C supply-dependent patterns. Nutrient recycling-related genes were regulated similarly by C-limitation and flg22, indicating re-arrangements of expression programs to redirect resources that establish or strengthen PTI. Ethylene and NAC transcription factors appear to play roles in these processes. Under C-limitation, PTI appears compromised based on suppression of genes required for continued biosynthetic capacity and defenses through flg22. Our results provide a foundation for the intuitive perception of the interplay between plant nutrition status and pathogen defense.

Abstract: In the present work, we have investigated the effect of cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine on the A549 and T24 cell lines in the context of structural and quantitative changes of F-actin, gelsolin and vimentin. The chosen cell lines constitute the established experimental models for lung and bladder cancers, respectively, in the case of which, smoking cigarettes is one of the key factor increasing their incidence rate significantly. In order to evaluate the impact of cotinine on the viability and proliferation of A549 and T24 cells, the MTT assay was performed. The organization and distribution of F-actin, gelsolin and vimentin were examined using conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The levels of F-actin and gelsolin as well as the percentages of apoptotic and dead cells were assessed using the image-based cytometer. The ultrastructural changes of cotinine-treated A549 and T24 cells were visualized under the transmission electron microscopy. We have shown here that cotinine enhances the survival and proliferation rate of A549 and T24 cells. We have also found that in A549 cells, but not in T24 cell line, cotinine acted stimulating on the vimentin filament network. Furthermore, the increase in the fluorescence intensity of gelsolin upon the addition of cotinine to the T24 cells was found to be correlated with the lack of apoptosis induction as well as the increase of migration potential of these cells. On the other hand, the cotinine-induced decrease in the fluorescence intensity of gelsolin was associated with the increase in the percentages of apoptotic A549 cells and the decreased migratory ability of these cells. Based on the obtained results, we propose that the gelsolin is an important cellular target for cotinine, through which this compound influences on the basic processes involved in neoplastic transformation and metastasis, such as migration and apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
In obesity, insulin resistance is linked to inflammation in several tissues. Although the gut is a very large lymphoid tissue, inflammation in the absorptive small intestine, the jejunum, where insulin regulates lipid and sugar absorption is unknown. We analyzed jejunal samples of 185 obese subjects stratified in three metabolic groups: without comorbidity, suffering from obesity-related comorbidity, and diabetic, versus 33 lean controls. Obesity increased both mucosa surface due to lower cell apoptosis and innate and adaptive immune cell populations. The preferential CD8αβ T cell location in epithelium over lamina propria appears a hallmark of obesity. Cytokine secretion by T cells from obese, but not lean, subjects blunted insulin signaling in enterocytes relevant to apical GLUT2 mislocation. Statistical links between T cell densities and BMI, NAFLD, or lipid metabolism suggest tissue crosstalk. Obesity triggers T-cell-mediated inflammation and enterocyte insulin resistance in the jejunum with potential broader systemic implications.

Abstract: The active metabolite of vitamin D such as 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3) is a well-known key regulatory factor in bone metabolism. However, little is known about the potential of vitamin D as an odontogenic inducer in human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D3 metabolite, 1α,25(OH)2D3, on odontoblastic differentiation in HDPCs. HDPCs extracted from maxillary supernumerary incisors and third molars were directly cultured with 1α,25(OH)2D3 in the absence of differentiation-inducing factors. Treatment of HDPCs with 1α,25(OH)2D3 at a concentration of 10 nM or 100 nM significantly upregulated the expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) and dentin matrix protein1 (DMP1), the odontogenesis-related genes. Also, 1α,25(OH)2D3 enhanced the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization in HDPCs. In addition, 1α,25(OH)2D3 induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), whereas the ERK inhibitor U0126 ameliorated the upregulation of DSPP and DMP1 and reduced the mineralization enhanced by 1α,25(OH)2D3. These results demonstrated that 1α,25(OH)2D3 promoted odontoblastic differentiation of HDPCs via modulating ERK activation.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal growth cone filopodia contain guidance receptors and contribute to axon guidance; however, the mechanism by which the guidance cue netrin increases filopodia density is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that TRIM9, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that localizes to filopodia tips and binds the netrin receptor DCC, interacts with and ubiquitinates the barbed-end polymerase VASP to modulate filopodial stability during netrin-dependent axon guidance. Studies with murine Trim9+/+ and Trim9−/− cortical neurons, along with a non-ubiquitinatable VASP mutant, demonstrate that TRIM9-mediated ubiquitination of VASP reduces VASP filopodial tip localization, VASP dynamics at tips, and filopodial stability. Upon netrin treatment, VASP is deubiquitinated, which promotes VASP tip localization and filopodial stability. Trim9 deletion induces axon guidance defects in vitro and in vivo, whereas a gradient of deubiquitinase inhibition promotes axon turning in vitro. We conclude that a gradient of TRIM9-mediated ubiquitination of VASP creates a filopodial stability gradient during axon turning.

Abstract: Summary
The ChREBP/Mondo-Mlx transcription factors are activated by sugars and are essential for sugar tolerance. They promote the conversion of sugars to lipids, but beyond this, their physiological roles are insufficiently understood. Here, we demonstrate that in an organism-wide setting in Drosophila, Mondo-Mlx controls the majority of sugar-regulated genes involved in nutrient digestion and transport as well as carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, human orthologs of the Mondo-Mlx targets display enrichment among gene variants associated with high circulating triglycerides. In addition to direct regulation of metabolic genes, Mondo-Mlx maintains metabolic homeostasis through downstream effectors, including the Activin ligand Dawdle and the Gli-similar transcription factor Sugarbabe. Sugarbabe controls a subset of Mondo-Mlx-dependent processes, including de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid desaturation. In sum, Mondo-Mlx is a master regulator of other sugar-responsive pathways essential for adaptation to a high-sugar diet.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic studies with S. cerevisiae Polδ (pol3-L612M) and Polε (pol2-M644G) mutant alleles, each of which display a higher rate for the generation of a specific mismatch, have led to the conclusion that Polε is the primary leading strand replicase and that Polδ is restricted to replicating the lagging strand template. Contrary to this widely accepted view, here we show that Polδ plays a major role in the replication of both DNA strands, and that the paucity of pol3-L612M-generated errors on the leading strand results from their more proficient removal. Thus, the apparent lack of Polδ contribution to leading strand replication is due to differential mismatch removal rather than differential mismatch generation. Altogether, our genetic studies with Pol3 and Pol2 mutator alleles support the conclusion that Polδ, and not Polε, is the major DNA polymerase for carrying out both leading and lagging DNA synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Direct visualization of HIV-1 replication would improve our understanding of the viral life cycle. We adapted established technology and reagents to develop an imaging approach, ViewHIV, which allows evaluation of early HIV-1 replication intermediates, from reverse transcription to integration. These methods permit the simultaneous evaluation of both the capsid protein (CA) and viral DNA genome (vDNA) components of HIV-1 in both the cytosol and nuclei of single cells. ViewHIV is relatively rapid, uses readily available reagents in combination with standard confocal microscopy, and can be done with virtually any HIV-1 strain and permissive cell lines or primary cells. Using ViewHIV, we find that CA enters the nucleus and associates with vDNA in both transformed and primary cells. We also find that CA’s interaction with the host polyadenylation factor, CPSF6, enhances nuclear entry and potentiates HIV-1’s depth of nuclear invasion, potentially aiding the virus’s integration into gene-dense regions.

Abstract: Summary
The MLE helicase remodels the roX lncRNAs, enabling the lncRNA-mediated assembly of the Drosophila dosage compensation complex. We identified a stable MLE core comprising the DExH helicase module and two auxiliary domains: a dsRBD and an OB-like fold. MLEcore is an unusual DExH helicase that can unwind blunt-ended RNA duplexes and has specificity for uridine nucleotides. We determined the 2.1 Å resolution structure of MLEcore bound to a U10 RNA and ADP-AlF4. The OB-like and dsRBD folds bind the DExH module and contribute to form the entrance of the helicase channel. Four uridine nucleotides engage in base-specific interactions, rationalizing the conservation of uridine-rich sequences in critical roX substrates. roX2 binding is orchestrated by MLE’s auxiliary domains, which is prerequisite for MLE localization to the male X chromosome. The structure visualizes a transition-state mimic of the reaction and suggests how eukaryotic DEAH/RHA helicases couple ATP hydrolysis to RNA translocation.

Abstract: Summary
Naive pluripotency is manifest in the preimplantation mammalian embryo. Here we determine transcriptome dynamics of mouse development from the eight-cell stage to postimplantation using lineage-specific RNA sequencing. This method combines high sensitivity and reporter-based fate assignment to acquire the full spectrum of gene expression from discrete embryonic cell types. We define expression modules indicative of developmental state and temporal regulatory patterns marking the establishment and dissolution of naive pluripotency in vivo. Analysis of embryonic stem cells and diapaused embryos reveals near-complete conservation of the core transcriptional circuitry operative in the preimplantation epiblast. Comparison to inner cell masses of marmoset primate blastocysts identifies a similar complement of pluripotency factors but use of alternative signaling pathways. Embryo culture experiments further indicate that marmoset embryos utilize WNT signaling during early lineage segregation, unlike rodents. These findings support a conserved transcription factor foundation for naive pluripotency while revealing species-specific regulatory features of lineage segregation.

Abstract: The Caenorhabditis elegans peroxidasins, PXN-1 and PXN-2, are extracellular peroxidases; pxn-2 is involved in muscle-epidermal attachment during embryonic morphogenesis and in specific axon guidance. Here we investigate potential roles of the other homologue of peroxidasin, pxn-1, in C. elegans. A pxn-1 deletion mutant showed high lethality under heat-stress conditions. Using a transcriptional GFP reporter, pxn-1 expression was observed in various tissues including neurons, muscles, and hypodermis. A translational fusion showed that PXN-1::GFP was secreted and localized in extracellular matrix, particularly along body wall muscles and pharyngeal muscles. Various neuronal developmental defects were observed in pxn-1 mutants and in pxn-1 over-expressing animals, including handedness, branching, breakage, tangling, and defasciculation. These results suggest that pxn-1, like other peroxidasins, plays an important role throughout development.

Abstract: Summary
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and its autosomal paralog FXR2P are selective neuronal RNA-binding proteins, and mice that lack either protein exhibit cognitive deficits. Although double-mutant mice display more severe learning deficits than single mutants, the molecular mechanism behind this remains unknown. In the present study, we discovered that FXR2P (also known as FXR2) is important for neuronal dendritic development. FMRP and FXR2P additively promote the maturation of new neurons by regulating a common target, the AMPA receptor GluA1, but they do so via distinct mechanisms: FXR2P binds and stabilizes GluA1 mRNA and enhances subsequent protein expression, whereas FMRP promotes GluA1 membrane delivery. Our findings unveil important roles for FXR2P and GluA1 in neuronal development, uncover a regulatory mechanism of GluA1, and reveal a functional convergence between fragile X proteins in neuronal development.

Abstract: Arabidopsis Shaggy-like protein kinases (ASKs) are Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of glycogen synthase kinase 3/SHAGGY-like kinases (GSK3/SGG), which are comprised of 10 genes with diverse functions. To dissect the function of ASKβ (AtSK32), ASKβ antisense transgenic plants were generated, revealing the effects of ASKβ down-regulation in Arabidopsis. Suppression of ASKβ expression specifically interfered with pollen development and fertility without altering the plants’ vegetative phenotypes, which differed from the phenotypes reported for Arabidopsis plants defective in other ASK members. The strength of these phenotypes showed an inverse correlation with the expression levels of ASKβ and its co-expressed genes. In the aborted pollen of ASKβ antisense plants, loss of nuclei and shrunken cytoplasm began to appear at the bicellular stage of microgametogenesis. The in silico analysis of promoter and the expression characteristics implicate ASKβ is associated with the expression of genes known to be involved in sperm cell differentiation. We speculate that ASKβ indirectly affects the transcription of its co-expressed genes through the phosphorylation of its target proteins during late pollen development.

Abstract: Summary
A decline in mitochondrial respiration represents the root cause of a large number of inborn errors of metabolism. It is also associated with common age-associated diseases and the aging process. To gain insight into the systemic, biochemical consequences of respiratory chain dysfunction, we performed a case-control, prospective metabolic profiling study in a genetically homogenous cohort of patients with Leigh syndrome French Canadian variant, a mitochondrial respiratory chain disease due to loss-of-function mutations in LRPPRC. We discovered 45 plasma and urinary analytes discriminating patients from controls, including classic markers of mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction (lactate and acylcarnitines), as well as unexpected markers of cardiometabolic risk (insulin and adiponectin), amino acid catabolism linked to NADH status (α-hydroxybutyrate), and NAD+ biosynthesis (kynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid). Our study identifies systemic, metabolic pathway derangements that can lie downstream of primary mitochondrial lesions, with implications for understanding how the organelle contributes to rare and common diseases.

Abstract: Summary
O2 sensing is essential for mammalian homeostasis. Peripheral chemoreceptors such as the carotid body (CB) contain cells with O2-sensitive K+ channels, which are inhibited by hypoxia to trigger fast adaptive cardiorespiratory reflexes. How variations of O2 tension (PO2) are detected and the mechanisms whereby these changes are conveyed to membrane ion channels have remained elusive. We have studied acute O2 sensing in conditional knockout mice lacking mitochondrial complex I (MCI) genes. We inactivated Ndufs2, which encodes a protein that participates in ubiquinone binding. Ndufs2-null mice lose the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia, although they respond to hypercapnia. Ndufs2-deficient CB cells have normal functions and ATP content but are insensitive to changes in PO2. Our data suggest that chemoreceptor cells have a specialized succinate-dependent metabolism that induces an MCI state during hypoxia, characterized by the production of reactive oxygen species and accumulation of reduced pyridine nucleotides, which signal neighboring K+ channels.

Abstract: Summary
The widespread availability of programmable site-specific nucleases now enables targeted gene disruption in the zebrafish. In this study, we applied site-specific nucleases to generate zebrafish lines bearing individual mutations in more than 20 genes. We found that mutations in only a small proportion of genes caused defects in embryogenesis. Moreover, mutants for ten different genes failed to recapitulate published Morpholino-induced phenotypes (morphants). The absence of phenotypes in mutant embryos was not likely due to maternal effects or failure to eliminate gene function. Consistently, a comparison of published morphant defects with the Sanger Zebrafish Mutation Project revealed that approximately 80% of morphant phenotypes were not observed in mutant embryos, similar to our mutant collection. Based on these results, we suggest that mutant phenotypes become the standard metric to define gene function in zebrafish, after which Morpholinos that recapitulate respective phenotypes could be reliably applied for ancillary analyses.

Abstract: Summary
Akt is frequently activated in human cancers. However, it is unknown whether systemic inhibition of a single Akt isoform could regress cancer progression in cancers that are not driven by Akt activation. We systemically deleted Akt1 after tumor onset in p53−/− mice, which develop tumors independently of Akt activation. Systemic Akt1 deletion regresses thymic lymphoma in p53−/− mice emulating p53 restoration. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Akt selectively kills thymic lymphoma cells and not primary thymocytes. Mechanistically, Akt1 inhibition in p53−/− thymic lymphoma inhibits Skp2 expression and induces FasL, which is the primary cause of cell death. Skp2 exerts resistance to cell death by antagonizing the induction of FasL and reducing FAS expression, which is linked to cyclin D1 expression. The results established a paradigm whereby systemic Akt1 inhibition is sufficient to regress tumors that are not driven by Akt activation and a mechanism of cell survival by Skp2.

Abstract: Summary
The axon initial segment (AIS), located within the first 30 μm of the axon, has two essential roles in generating action potentials and maintaining axonal identity. AIS assembly depends on a ßIV-spectrin/ankyrin G scaffold, but its macromolecular arrangement is not well understood. Here, we quantitatively determined the AIS nanoscale architecture by using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). First, we directly demonstrate that the 190-nm periodicity of the AIS submembrane lattice results from longitudinal, head-to-head ßIV-spectrin molecules connecting actin rings. Using multicolor 3D-STORM, we resolve the nanoscale organization of ankyrin G: its amino terminus associates with the submembrane lattice, whereas the C terminus radially extends (∼32 nm on average) toward the cytosol. This AIS nano-architecture is highly resistant to cytoskeletal perturbations, indicating its role in structural stabilization. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of AIS molecular architecture and will help reveal the crucial physiological functions of this compartment.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor BRCA2 is thought to facilitate the handoff of ssDNA from replication protein A (RPA) to the RAD51 recombinase during DNA break and replication fork repair by homologous recombination. However, we find that RPA-RAD51 exchange requires the BRCA2 partner DSS1. Biochemical, structural, and in vivo analyses reveal that DSS1 allows the BRCA2-DSS1 complex to physically and functionally interact with RPA. Mechanistically, DSS1 acts as a DNA mimic to attenuate the affinity of RPA for ssDNA. A mutation in the solvent-exposed acidic domain of DSS1 compromises the efficacy of RPA-RAD51 exchange. Thus, by targeting RPA and mimicking DNA, DSS1 functions with BRCA2 in a two-component homologous recombination mediator complex in genome maintenance and tumor suppression. Our findings may provide a paradigm for understanding the roles of DSS1 in other biological processes.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) reside in barrier tissues and provide local immediate protective immunity. Here, we show that the salivary gland (SG) most-effectively induces CD8+ and CD4+ TRM cells against murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), which persists in and spreads from this organ. TRM generation depended on local antigen for CD4+, but not CD8+, TRM cells, highlighting major differences in T cell subset-specific demands for TRM development. CMV-specific CD8+ T cells fail to control virus replication upon primary infection in the SG due to CMV-induced MHC I downregulation in glandular epithelial cells. Using intraglandular infection, we challenge this notion and demonstrate that memory CD8+ T cells confer immediate protection against locally introduced MCMV despite active viral immune evasion, owing to early viral tropism to cells that largely withstand MHC I downregulation. Thus, we unravel a yet-unappreciated role for memory CD8+ T cells in protecting mucosal tissues against CMV infection.

Abstract: Summary
The increase in multi-drug-resistant bacteria is limiting the effectiveness of currently approved antibiotics, leading to a renewed interest in antibiotics with distinct chemical scaffolds. We have solved the structures of the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome with A-, P-, and E-site tRNAs bound and in complex with either the aminocyclitol-containing antibiotic hygromycin A (HygA) or the nucleoside antibiotic A201A. Both antibiotics bind at the peptidyl transferase center and sterically occlude the CCA-end of the A-tRNA from entering the A site of the peptidyl transferase center. Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments reveal that HygA and A201A specifically interfere with full accommodation of the A-tRNA, leading to the presence of tRNA accommodation intermediates and thereby inhibiting peptide bond formation. Thus, our results provide not only insight into the mechanism of action of HygA and A201A, but also into the fundamental process of tRNA accommodation during protein synthesis.

Abstract: Recently it has been reported that reactive oxygen species plays an important role in several physiological processes. Reactive oxygen species are generated by reactive oxygen-synthesizing enzymes (Nox). We immunohistochemically investigated expression and localization of the Nox family in a mouse circumvallate papillae. In the epithelium of the circumvallate papilla, Nox 1, 2, 3, and 4, Noxo1, and Noxa1 were expressed. In the circumvallate papilla, Nox2 was more weakly expressed in the lateral than in the upper part, and Nox3 was not expressed. In the taste buds, Nox 1, 2, 3, and 4, Noxo1, and Noxa1 were expressed; the Nox expression pattern varied with the cell type. In type II cells, Nox 1, 3, and 4, Noxo1, and Noxa1 were expressed. In type III cells, Nox2, besides Nox 1, 3, and 4, Noxo1, and Noxa1, were specifically expressed, unlike in other taste bud cells. In the mouse circumvallate papilla, Nox is always expressed, suggesting the generation of reactive oxygen species. Of note, all cells comprising taste buds expressed Nox, with each showing a specific Nox expression pattern.

Abstract: Summary
Cilia are highly specialized antennae-like cellular organelles. Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase E (INPP5E) converts PI(4,5)P2 into PI4P and is required for proper ciliary function. Although Inpp5e mutations are associated with ciliopathies in humans and mice, the precise molecular role INPP5E plays in cilia remains unclear. Here, we report that Drosophila INPP5E (dINPP5E) regulates ciliary protein trafficking by controlling the phosphoinositide composition of ciliary membranes. Mutations in dInpp5e lead to hearing deficits due to the mislocalization of dTULP and mechanotransduction channels, Inactive and NOMPC, in chordotonal cilia. Both loss of dINPP5E and ectopic expression of the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase Skittles increase PI(4,5)P2 levels in the ciliary base. The fact that Skittles expression phenocopies the dInpp5e mutants confirms a central role for PI(4,5)P2 in the regulation of dTULP, Inactive, and NOMPC localization. These data suggest that the spatial localization and levels of PI(4,5)P2 in ciliary membranes are important regulators of ciliary trafficking and function.

Abstract: P2 receptors are membrane-bound receptors for extracellular nucleotides such as ATP and UTP. P2 receptors have been classified as ligand-gated ion channels or P2X receptors and G protein-coupled P2Y receptors. Recently, purinergic signaling has begun to attract attention as a potential therapeutic target for a variety of diseases especially associated with gastroenterology. This study determined the ATP and UTP-induced receptor signaling mechanism in feline esophageal contraction. Contraction of dispersed feline esophageal smooth muscle cells was measured by scanning micrometry. Phosphorylation of MLC20 was determined by western blot analysis. ATP and UTP elicited maximum esophageal contraction at 30 s and 10 μM concentration. Contraction of dispersed cells treated with 10 μM ATP was inhibited by nifedipine. However, contraction induced by 0.1 μM ATP, 0.1 μM UTP and 10 μM UTP was decreased by U73122, chelerythrine, ML-9, PTX and GDPβS. Contraction induced by 0.1 μM ATP and UTP was inhibited by Gαi3 or Gαq antibodies and by PLCβ1 or PLCβ3 antibodies. Phosphorylated MLC20 was increased by ATP and UTP treatment. In conclusion, esophageal contraction induced by ATP and UTP was preferentially mediated by P2Y receptors coupled to Gαi3 and G q proteins, which activate PLCβ1 and PLCβ3. Subsequently, increased intracellular Ca2+ and activated PKC triggered stimulation of MLC kinase and inhibition of MLC phosphatase. Finally, increased pMLC20 generated esophageal contraction.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse whiskers are somatotopically mapped in brainstem trigeminal nuclei as neuronal modules known as barrelettes. Whisker-related afferents form barrelettes in ventral principal sensory (vPrV) nucleus, whereas mandibular input targets dorsal PrV (dPrV). How barrelette neuron identity and circuitry is established is poorly understood. We found that ectopic Hoxa2 expression in dPrV neurons is sufficient to attract whisker-related afferents, induce asymmetrical dendrite arbors, and allow ectopic barrelette map formation. Moreover, the thalamic area forming whisker-related barreloids is prenatally targeted by both vPrV and dPrV axons followed by perinatal large-scale pruning of dPrV axons and refinement of vPrV barrelette input. Ectopic Hoxa2 expression allows topographically directed targeting and refinement of dPrV axons with vPrV axons into a single whisker-related barreloid map. Thus, a single HOX transcription factor is sufficient to switch dPrV into a vPrV barrelette neuron program and coordinate input-output topographic connectivity of a dermatome-specific circuit module.

Abstract: Most imprinted genes are concerned with embryonic development, especially placental development. Here, we identified a placenta-specific imprinted gene Qpct. Our results show that Qpct is widely expressed during early embryonic development and can be detected in the telecephalon, midbrain, and rhombencephalon at E9.5–E11.5. Moreover, Qpct is strikingly expressed in the brain, lung and liver in E15.5. Expression signals for Qpct achieved a peak at E15.5 during placental development and were only detected in the labyrinth layer in E15.5 placenta. ChIP assay results suggest that the modification of histone H3K4me3 can result in maternal activating of Qpct.

Abstract: Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is important in cardiac protection in diseased heart. Recently, we have reported that nNOS is associated with myofilament Ca2+ desensitization in cardiac myocytes from hypertensive rats. So far, the effect of myofilament Ca2+ desensitization or nNOS on L-type Ca2+ channel activity (ICa) in cardiac myocyte is unclear. Here, we examined nNOS regulation of ICa in left ventricular (LV) myocytes from sham and angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertensive rats. Our results showed that basal ICa was not different between sham and hypertension (from −60 to +40mV, 0.1Hz). S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (SMTC), a selective nNOS inhibitor, increased peak ICa similarly in both groups. However, chelation of intracellular Ca2+ [Ca2+]i with BAPTA increased ICa and abolished SMTC-augmentation of ICa only in hypertension. Myofilament Ca2+ desensitization with butanedione monoxime (BDM), a myosin ATPase inhibitor, decreased ICa in both groups but to a greater extent in hypertension. Intracellular BAPTA or nNOS inhibition reinstated ICa in the presence of BDM to the basal level, suggesting Ca2+-dependent inactivation of ICa by nNOS and greater vulnerability in hypertension. Increasing stimulation frequencies (2, 4 and 8Hz) attenuated myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity in sham and reduced peak ICa in both groups. Nevertheless, SMTC or BAPTA exerted no effect on ICa at high frequencies in either group. These results suggest that nNOS attenuates ICa via Ca2+-dependent mechanism and the vulnerability is greater in hypertension subject to myofilament Ca2+ desensitization. nNOS or [Ca2+]i does not affect ICa at high stimulation frequencies. The results were recapitulated with computer simulation.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium falciparum engineer infected erythrocytes to present the malarial protein, VAR2CSA, which binds a distinct type chondroitin sulfate (CS) exclusively expressed in the placenta. Here, we show that the same CS modification is present on a high proportion of malignant cells and that it can be specifically targeted by recombinant VAR2CSA (rVAR2). In tumors, placental-like CS chains are linked to a limited repertoire of cancer-associated proteoglycans including CD44 and CSPG4. The rVAR2 protein localizes to tumors in vivo and rVAR2 fused to diphtheria toxin or conjugated to hemiasterlin compounds strongly inhibits in vivo tumor cell growth and metastasis. Our data demonstrate how an evolutionarily refined parasite-derived protein can be exploited to target a common, but complex, malignancy-associated glycosaminoglycan modification.

Abstract: Summary
Directional cell growth requires that cells read and interpret shallow chemical gradients, but how the gradient directional information is identified remains elusive. We use single-cell analysis and mathematical modeling to define the cellular gradient decoding network in yeast. Our results demonstrate that the spatial information of the gradient signal is read locally within the polarity site complex using double-positive feedback between the GTPase Cdc42 and trafficking of the receptor Ste2. Spatial decoding critically depends on low Cdc42 activity, which is maintained by the MAPK Fus3 through sequestration of the Cdc42 activator Cdc24. Deregulated Cdc42 or Ste2 trafficking prevents gradient decoding and leads to mis-oriented growth. Our work discovers how a conserved set of components assembles a network integrating signal intensity and directionality to decode the spatial information contained in chemical gradients.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages play important roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the differentiation and responses of intestinal DCs and macrophages remain poorly understood. Here, we have identified microRNA miR-223 as a key molecule for regulating these processes. Deficiency of miR-223 led to a significantly decreased number of intestinal CX3CR1hi macrophages at steady state. Both intestinal CX3CR1hi macrophages and CD103+ conventional DCs (cDCs) in miR-223-deficient mice exhibited a strong pro-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, miR-223-deficient monocytes gave rise to more monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) and produced more pro-inflammatory cytokines upon stimulation. Using a mouse model of colitis, we demonstrated that the miR-223 deficiency resulted in more severe colitis. Target gene analysis further identified that the effects of miR-223 on DCs and macrophages were mediated by directly targeting C/EBPβ. Taken together, our study identifies a role for miR-223 as a critical regulator of intestinal homeostasis.

Abstract: L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) are widely expressed within different brain regions including the hippocampus. The isoforms Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 have been shown to be involved in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, cognitive functions that require proper hippocampal neurogenesis. In vitro, functional LTCCs are expressed on neuronal progenitor cells, where they promote neuronal differentiation. Expression of LTCCs on neural stem and progenitor cells within the neurogenic regions in the adult brain in vivo has not been examined so far, and a contribution of the individual isoforms Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 to adult neurogenesis remained to be clarified. To reveal the role of these channels we first evaluated the expression patterns of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) in adult (2- and 3-month old) and middle-aged (15-month old) mice on mRNA and protein levels. We performed immunohistological analysis of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult and middle-aged Cav1.3−/− mice and finally addressed the importance of Cav1.3 for hippocampal function by evaluating spatial memory and depression-like behavior in adult Cav1.3−/− mice. Our results showed Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 expression at different stages of neuronal differentiation. While Cav1.2 was primarily restricted to mature NeuN+ granular neurons, Cav1.3 was expressed in Nestin+ neural stem cells and in mature NeuN+ granular neurons. Adult and middle-aged Cav1.3−/− mice showed severe impairments in dentate gyrus neurogenesis, with significantly smaller dentate gyrus volume, reduced survival of newly generated cells, and reduced neuronal differentiation. Further, Cav1.3−/− mice showed impairment in the hippocampus dependent object location memory test, implicating Cav1.3 as an essential element for hippocampus-associated cognitive functions. Thus, modulation of LTCC activities may have a crucial impact on neurogenic responses and cognition, which should be considered for future therapeutic administration of LTCCs modulators.

Abstract: Summary
Although dendritic cell (DC) dysfunction in cancer is a well-recognized consequence of cancer-associated inflammation that contributes to immune evasion, the mechanisms that drive this process remain elusive. Here, we show the critical importance of tumor-derived TLR2 ligands in the generation of immunosuppressive IL-10-producing human and mouse DCs. TLR2 ligation induced two parallel synergistic processes that converged to activate STAT3: stimulation of autocrine IL-6 and IL-10 and upregulation of their respective cell surface receptors, which lowered the STAT3 activation threshold. We identified versican as a soluble tumor-derived factor that activates TLR2 in DCs. TLR2 blockade in vivo improved intra-tumor DC immunogenicity and enhanced the efficacy of immunotherapy. Our findings provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms of DC dysfunction in cancer and identify TLR2 as a relevant therapeutic target to improve cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The DEAD-box protein DDX6 is a central component of translational repression mechanisms in maternal mRNA storage in oocytes and microRNA-mediated silencing in somatic cells. DDX6 interacts with the CCR4-NOT complex and functions in concert with several post-transcriptional regulators, including Edc3, Pat1, and 4E-T. We show that the conserved CUP-homology domain (CHD) of human 4E-T interacts directly with DDX6 in both the presence and absence of the central MIF4G domain of CNOT1. The 2.1-Å resolution structure of the corresponding ternary complex reveals how 4E-T CHD wraps around the RecA2 domain of DDX6 and contacts CNOT1. Although 4E-T CHD lacks recognizable sequence similarity with Edc3 or Pat1, it shares the same DDX6-binding surface. In contrast to 4E-T, however, the Edc3 and Pat1 FDF motifs dissociate from DDX6 upon CNOT1 MIF4G binding in vitro. The results underscore the presence of a complex network of simultaneous and/or mutually exclusive interactions in DDX6-mediated repression.

Abstract: Sildenafil is an important phosphodiesterase inhibitor used to treat a range of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, prostatic hyperplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Its main mechanism of action is the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5, leading to increased intracellular cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate. This second messenger plays an interesting role in the reproductive tract. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of Sildenafil on folliculogenesis and fertility in mice. To do so, C57BL/6 wild-type mice and inducible nitric oxide synthase knockout (iNOS−/−) mice were treated with Sildenafil, and reproductive variables were evaluated. The treated and control animals underwent estrous cycle and fertility assay. Lipid profile, serum nitric oxide levels and the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, inducible nitric oxide synthase and guanylate cyclase were evaluated. Additionally, ovaries were submitted to histological and morphological analysis. The findings demonstrated that chronic treatment with Sildenafil had no effect on folliculogenesis or fertility in C57BL/6 mice, suggesting that this drug can be safely used by women of childbearing age.

Abstract: Plant growth and development are coordinately orchestrated by environmental cues and phytohormones. Light acts as a key environmental factor for fundamental plant growth and physiology through photosensory phytochromes and underlying molecular mechanisms. Although phytochromes are known to possess serine/threonine protein kinase activities, whether they trigger a signal transduction pathway via an intracellular protein kinase network remains unknown. In analyses of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK, also called MKK) mutants, the mkk3 mutant has shown both a hypersensitive response in plant hormone gibberellin (GA) and a less sensitive response in red light signaling. Surprisingly, light-induced MAPK activation in wild-type (WT) seedlings and constitutive MAPK phosphorylation in dark-grown mkk3 mutant seedlings have also been found, respectively. Therefore, this study suggests that MKK3 acts in negative regulation in darkness and in light-induced MAPK activation during dark-light transition.

Abstract: Summary
BRAF and MEK inhibitors are effective in BRAF mutant melanoma, but most patients eventually relapse with acquired resistance, and others present intrinsic resistance to these drugs. Resistance is often mediated by pathway reactivation through receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/SRC-family kinase (SFK) signaling or mutant NRAS, which drive paradoxical reactivation of the pathway. We describe pan-RAF inhibitors (CCT196969, CCT241161) that also inhibit SFKs. These compounds do not drive paradoxical pathway activation and inhibit MEK/ERK in BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma. They inhibit melanoma cells and patient-derived xenografts that are resistant to BRAF and BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Thus, paradox-breaking pan-RAF inhibitors that also inhibit SFKs could provide first-line treatment for BRAF and NRAS mutant melanomas and second-line treatment for patients who develop resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the increasing use of optogenetics in vivo, the effects of direct light exposure to brain tissue are understudied. Of particular concern is the potential for heat induced by prolonged optical stimulation. We demonstrate that high-intensity light, delivered through an optical fiber, is capable of elevating firing rate locally, even in the absence of opsin expression. Predicting the severity and spatial extent of any temperature increase during optogenetic stimulation is therefore of considerable importance. Here, we describe a realistic model that simulates light and heat propagation during optogenetic experiments. We validated the model by comparing predicted and measured temperature changes in vivo. We further demonstrate the utility of this model by comparing predictions for various wavelengths of light and fiber sizes, as well as testing methods for reducing heat effects on neural targets in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, insight into gene function is typically obtained by in silico homology searches and/or phenotypic analyses of strains bearing mutations within open reading frames. However, the studies herein illustrate how mRNA function is not limited to the expression of a cognate protein. We demonstrate that a stress-induced protein-encoding mRNA (irvA) from the dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans directly modulates target mRNA (gbpC) stability through seed pairing interactions. The 5′ untranslated region of irvA mRNA is a trans riboregulator of gbpC and a critical activator of the DDAG stress response, whereas IrvA functions independently in the regulation of natural competence. The irvA riboregulatory domain controls GbpC production by forming irvA-gbpC hybrid mRNA duplexes that prevent gbpC degradation by an RNase J2-mediated pathway. These studies implicate a potentially ubiquitous role for typical protein-encoding mRNAs as riboregulators, which could alter current concepts in gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Although transcription factors are prevalent among yeast prion proteins, the role of prion-mediated transcriptional regulation remains elusive. Here, we show that the yeast prion [SWI+] abolishes flocculin (FLO) gene expression and results in a complete loss of multicellularity. Further investigation demonstrates that besides Swi1, multiple other proteins essential for FLO expression, including Mss11, Sap30, and Msn1 also undergo conformational changes and become inactivated in [SWI+] cells. Moreover, the asparagine-rich region of Mss11 can exist as prion-like aggregates specifically in [SWI+] cells, which are SDS resistant, heritable, and curable, but become metastable after separation from [SWI+]. Our findings thus reveal a prion-mediated mechanism through which multiple regulators in a biological pathway can be inactivated. In combination with the partial loss-of-function phenotypes of [SWI+] cells on non-glucose sugar utilization, our data therefore demonstrate that a prion can influence distinct traits differently through multi-level regulations, providing insights into the biological roles of prions.

Abstract: Summary
During somitogenesis in embryos, a posteriorly moving differentiation front arrests the oscillations of “segmentation clock” genes, leaving behind a frozen, periodic pattern of expression stripes. Both mathematical theories and experimental observations have invoked a “clock and wavefront” model to explain this phenomenon, in which long-range molecular gradients control the movement of the front and therefore the placement of the stripes in the embryo. Here, we develop a fundamentally different model—a progressive oscillatory reaction-diffusion (PORD) system driven by short-range interactions. In this model, posterior movement of the front is a local, emergent phenomenon that, in contrast to the clock and wavefront model, is not controlled by global positional information. The PORD model explains important features of somitogenesis, such as size regulation, that previous reaction-diffusion models could not explain. Moreover, the PORD and clock and wavefront models make different predictions about the results of FGF-inhibition and tissue-cutting experiments, and we demonstrate that the results of these experiments favor the PORD model.

Abstract: Summary
Recognition and repair of damaged replication forks are essential to maintain genome stability and are coordinated by the combined action of the Fanconi anemia and homologous recombination pathways. These pathways are vital to protect stalled replication forks from uncontrolled nucleolytic activity, which otherwise causes irreparable genomic damage. Here, we identify BOD1L as a component of this fork protection pathway, which safeguards genome stability after replication stress. Loss of BOD1L confers exquisite cellular sensitivity to replication stress and uncontrolled resection of damaged replication forks, due to a failure to stabilize RAD51 at these forks. Blocking DNA2-dependent resection, or downregulation of the helicases BLM and FBH1, suppresses both catastrophic fork processing and the accumulation of chromosomal damage in BOD1L-deficient cells. Thus, our work implicates BOD1L as a critical regulator of genome integrity that restrains nucleolytic degradation of damaged replication forks.

Abstract: Summary
Actin and actin-associated proteins migrate within various cell types. To uncover the mechanism of their migration, we analyzed actin waves, which translocate actin and actin-associated proteins along neuronal axons toward the growth cones. We found that arrays of actin filaments constituting waves undergo directional assembly and disassembly, with their polymerizing ends oriented toward the axonal tip, and that the lateral side of the filaments is mechanically anchored to the adhesive substrate. A combination of live-cell imaging, molecular manipulation, force measurement, and mathematical modeling revealed that wave migration is driven by directional assembly and disassembly of actin filaments and their anchorage to the substrate. Actin-associated proteins co-migrate with actin filaments by interacting with them. Furthermore, blocking this migration, by creating an adhesion-free gap along the axon, disrupts axonal protrusion. Our findings identify a molecular mechanism that translocates actin and associated proteins toward the cell’s leading edge, thereby promoting directional cell motility.

Abstract: Summary
Target of Rapamycin (TOR) plays central roles in the regulation of eukaryote growth as the hub of two essential multiprotein complexes: TORC1, which is rapamycin-sensitive, and the lesser characterized TORC2, which is not. TORC2 is a key regulator of lipid biosynthesis and Akt-mediated survival signaling. In spite of its importance, its structure and the molecular basis of its rapamycin insensitivity are unknown. Using crosslinking-mass spectrometry and electron microscopy, we determined the architecture of TORC2. TORC2 displays a rhomboid shape with pseudo-2-fold symmetry and a prominent central cavity. Our data indicate that the C-terminal part of Avo3, a subunit unique to TORC2, is close to the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain of Tor2. Removal of this sequence generated a FKBP12-rapamycin-sensitive TORC2 variant, which provides a powerful tool for deciphering TORC2 function in vivo. Using this variant, we demonstrate a role for TORC2 in G2/M cell-cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
Light regulates major plant developmental transitions by orchestrating a series of nuclear events. This study uncovers the molecular function of the natural variant, TZP (Tandem Zinc-finger-Plus3), as a signal integrator of light and photoperiodic pathways in transcriptional nuclear foci. We report that TZP acts as a positive regulator of photoperiodic flowering via physical interactions with the red-light receptor phytochrome B (phyB). We demonstrate that TZP localizes in dynamic nuclear domains regulated by light quality and photoperiod. This study shows that phyB is indispensable not only for localizing TZP to transcriptionally active nuclear photobodies, but also for recruiting TZP on the promoter of the floral inducer FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Our findings signify a unique transcriptional regulatory role to the highly enigmatic plant nuclear photobodies, where TZP directly activates FT gene expression and promotes flowering.

Abstract: Summary
Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones that prevent the aggregation of unfolding proteins during proteotoxic stress. In Caenorhabditis elegans, Sip1 is the only sHsp exclusively expressed in oocytes and embryos. Here, we demonstrate that Sip1 is essential for heat shock survival of reproducing adults and embryos. X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy revealed that Sip1 exists in a range of well-defined globular assemblies consisting of two half-spheres, each made of dimeric “spokes.” Strikingly, the oligomeric distribution of Sip1 as well as its chaperone activity depend on pH, with a trend toward smaller species and higher activity at acidic conditions such as present in nematode eggs. The analysis of the interactome shows that Sip1 has a specific substrate spectrum including proteins that are essential for embryo development.

Abstract: Increase of Ca2+ influx in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) cells has been reported to be related to Transient Receptor Potential Canonical (TRPC6) channel, which is implicated in a functional coupling with Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). Several members of the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid (TRPV) channels family have already been described as emerging target for respiratory diseases. Two specific isoforms, TRPV5 and TRPV6 are of particular interest in the context of CF Ca2+ homeostasis as they are highly selective toward Ca2+ and constitutively activated. Thus, we investigated the involvement of these channels in Ca2+ influx in CF and non-CF human bronchial epithelial cell lines. 16HBE14o-, CFBE41o- cell lines, primary human airway epithelial cells (hAEC) and freshly isolated human airway epithelial cells from CF and non-CF individuals were used. We showed that both channels are expressed in CF and non-CF cells and constitutive Ca2+ influx was significantly higher (85%) in cells from CF individuals compared to cells from non-CF ones. Using the selective inhibitor of TRPV6 channel SOR-C27 and a siRNA strategy, our results revealed that TRPV6 was mostly involved in the increase of Ca2+ influx. TRPV6 channel is negatively regulated by the PLC-PIP2 pathway. We measured the Ca2+ influx in the presence of the non-specific PLC inhibitor, U73122, in non-CF human bronchial epithelial cells. Ca2+ influx was increased by 33% with U73122 and this increase was largely reduced in the presence of SOR-C27. PLC inhibition in CF cells by U73122 had no effect on Ca2+ influx. These results showed that PLC-PIP2 pathway is dysregulated in CF cells and leads to the increase of TRPV6 activity. The regulation of TRPV6 by PLC-PIP2 pathway implicates the specific PLC isoform, PLC-δ1. Immunoblot experiments revealed that expression of PLC-δ1 was decreased by 70% in CF cells. TRPV6 activity was normalized but not the level of expression of PLC-δ1 protein after F508del-CFTR rescue by low temperature for 48h or treated for 24h by 10μM VX-809 in CF cells. This study revealed TRPV6 and PLC-δ1 as critical actor of Ca2+ homeostasis in CF human bronchial epithelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue homeostasis requires somatic stem cell maintenance; however, mechanisms regulating this process during organogenesis are not well understood. Here, we identify asymmetrically renewing basal and luminal stem cells in the mammary end bud. We demonstrate that SLIT2/ROBO1 signaling regulates the choice between self-renewing asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) and expansive symmetric cell divisions (SCDs) by governing Inscuteable (mInsc), a key member of the spindle orientation machinery, through the transcription factor Snail (SNAI1). Loss of SLIT2/ROBO1 signaling increases SNAI1 in the nucleus. Overexpression of SNAI1 increases mInsc expression, an effect that is inhibited by SLIT2 treatment. Increased mInsc does not change cell proliferation in the mammary gland (MG) but instead causes more basal cap cells to divide via SCD, at the expense of ACD, leading to more stem cells and larger outgrowths. Together, our studies provide insight into how the number of mammary stem cells is regulated by the extracellular cue SLIT2.

Abstract: Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells respond to hypotonic stress (HTS) by a cytosolic calcium rise, either generated by an influx of calcium from extracellular medium, when calcium is available, or by a release from intracellular stores in scarcity of extracellular calcium. Calcium release from intracellular compartments is peculiarly inhibited by external calcium in a calcineurin-independent and Cch1-, but not Mid1-, driven manner. HTS-induced calcium release is also negatively regulated by the ER protein Cls2 and involves a poorly characterized protein, FLC2/YAL053W gene product, previously proposed to be required for FAD transport in the ER, albeit, due to its molecular features, it was also previously classified as an ion transporter. A computational analysis revealed that this gene and its three homologs in S. cerevisiae, together with previously identified Schizosaccharomyces pombe pkd2 and Neurospora crassa calcium-related spray protein, belong to a fungal branch of TRP-like ion transporters related to human mucolipin and polycystin 2 calcium transporters. Moreover, disruption of FLC2 gene confers severe sensitivity to Calcofluor white and hyper-activation of the cell wall integrity MAPK cascade, suggesting a role in cell wall maintenance as previously suggested for the fission yeast homolog. Perturbation in cytosolic resting calcium concentration and hyper-activation of calcineurin in exponentially growing cells suggest a role for this transporter in calcium homeostasis in yeast.

Abstract: Summary
Genome rearrangements, a hallmark of cancer, can result in gene fusions with oncogenic properties. Using DNA paired-end-tag (DNA-PET) whole-genome sequencing, we analyzed 15 gastric cancers (GCs) from Southeast Asians. Rearrangements were enriched in open chromatin and shaped by chromatin structure. We identified seven rearrangement hot spots and 136 gene fusions. In three out of 100 GC cases, we found recurrent fusions between CLDN18, a tight junction gene, and ARHGAP26, a gene encoding a RHOA inhibitor. Epithelial cell lines expressing CLDN18-ARHGAP26 displayed a dramatic loss of epithelial phenotype and long protrusions indicative of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Fusion-positive cell lines showed impaired barrier properties, reduced cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, retarded wound healing, and inhibition of RHOA. Gain of invasion was seen in cancer cell lines expressing the fusion. Thus, CLDN18-ARHGAP26 mediates epithelial disintegration, possibly leading to stomach H+ leakage, and the fusion might contribute to invasiveness once a cell is transformed.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies on T follicular helper (Tfh) cells have significantly advanced our understanding of T cell-dependent B cell responses. However, little is known about the early stage of Tfh cell commitment by dendritic cells (DCs), particularly by the conventional CD8α+ and CD8α− DC subsets. We show that CD8α− DCs localized at the interfollicular zone play a pivotal role in the induction of antigen-specific Tfh cells by upregulating the expression of Icosl and Ox40l through the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Tfh cells induced by CD8α− DCs function as true B cell helpers, resulting in significantly increased humoral immune responses against various human pathogenic antigens, including Yersinia pestis LcrV, HIV Gag, and hepatitis B surface antigen. Our findings uncover a mechanistic role of CD8α− DCs in the initiation of Tfh cell differentiation and thereby provide a rationale for investigating CD8α− DCs in enhancing antigen-specific humoral immune responses for improving vaccines and therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
The dominant TLR5R392X polymorphism abrogates flagellin responses in >7% of humans. We report that TLR5-dependent commensal bacteria drive malignant progression at extramucosal locations by increasing systemic IL-6, which drives mobilization of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Mechanistically, expanded granulocytic MDSCs cause γδ lymphocytes in TLR5-responsive tumors to secrete galectin-1, dampening antitumor immunity and accelerating malignant progression. In contrast, IL-17 is consistently upregulated in TLR5-unresponsive tumor-bearing mice but only accelerates malignant progression in IL-6-unresponsive tumors. Importantly, depletion of commensal bacteria abrogates TLR5-dependent differences in tumor growth. Contrasting differences in inflammatory cytokines and malignant evolution are recapitulated in TLR5-responsive/unresponsive ovarian and breast cancer patients. Therefore, inflammation, antitumor immunity, and the clinical outcome of cancer patients are influenced by a common TLR5 polymorphism.

Abstract: Summary
The highly conserved COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex is a key regulator of all cullin-RING-ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), the largest family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Until now, it was accepted that the CSN is composed of eight canonical components. Here, we report the discovery of an additional integral and stoichiometric subunit that had thus far evaded detection, and we named it CSNAP (CSN acidic protein). We show that CSNAP binds CSN3, CSN5, and CSN6, and its incorporation into the CSN complex is mediated through the C-terminal region involving conserved aromatic residues. Moreover, depletion of this small protein leads to reduced proliferation and a flattened and enlarged morphology. Finally, on the basis of sequence and structural properties shared by both CSNAP and DSS1, a component of the related 19S lid proteasome complex, we propose that CSNAP, the ninth CSN subunit, is the missing paralogous subunit of DSS1.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant cells exhibit aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) and become dependent on de novo lipogenesis, which sustains rapid proliferation and resistance to cellular stress. The nuclear receptor liver-X-receptor (LXR) directly regulates expression of key glycolytic and lipogenic genes. To disrupt these oncogenic metabolism pathways, we designed an LXR inverse agonist SR9243 that induces LXR-corepressor interaction. In cancer cells, SR9243 significantly inhibited the Warburg effect and lipogenesis by reducing glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression. SR9243 induced apoptosis in tumors without inducing weight loss, hepatotoxicity, or inflammation. Our results suggest that LXR inverse agonists may be an effective cancer treatment approach.

Abstract: Summary
Determination of left-right asymmetry in mouse embryos is established by a leftward fluid flow that is generated by clockwise rotation of node cilia. How node cilia achieve stable unidirectional rotation has remained unknown, however. Here we show that brief exposure to the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel (Taxol) induces randomly directed rotation and changes the ultrastructure of node cilia. In vivo observations and a computer simulation revealed that a regular 9+0 arrangement of doublet microtubules is essential for stable unidirectional rotation of node cilia. The 9+2 motile cilia of the airway, which manifest planar beating, are resistant to Taxol treatment. However, the airway cilia of mice lacking the radial spoke head protein Rsph4a undergo rotational movement instead of planar beating, are prone to microtubule rearrangement, and are sensitive to Taxol. Our results suggest that the absence of radial spokes allows node cilia to rotate unidirectionally but, as a trade-off, renders them ultrastructurally fragile.

Abstract: Androgens have essential roles in the regulation of follicular development and female fertility. Androgen excess is the leading defect in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients and involved in the ovarian dysfunction. The aim of this study was to elucidate the regarding regulatory role of androgen in the follicular development of female mouse. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analyses were performed to detect androgen receptor (AR) and Connexin 43 (Cx43) expression in ovaries from both control and testosterone-treated group mice. In this study, localizations of AR and Cx43 were dramatically altered in testosterone-treated mouse ovaries. In addition, AR expression was significantly increased, whereas Cx43 expression was markedly decreased after testosterone treatment. Alterations of AR and Cx43 expression by testosterone with concomitant reduction of MII oocytes. Overall, these results suggest the involvement of androgen in the regulation of AR and Cx43 localizations in mouse ovary. Alterations of AR and Cx43 expression by testosterone may affect normal folliculogenesis. Together these findings will enable us to begin understanding the important roles of AR and Cx43 actions in the regulation of follicular development, as well as providing insights into the role of AR and Cx43 actions in the androgen-associated reproductive diseases such as PCOS.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding individual variation is fundamental to personalized medicine. Yet interpreting complex phenotype data, such as multi-compartment metabolomic profiles, in the context of genotype data for an individual is complicated by interactions within and between cells and remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we constructed multi-omic, data-driven, personalized whole-cell kinetic models of erythrocyte metabolism for 24 healthy individuals based on fasting-state plasma and erythrocyte metabolomics and whole-genome genotyping. We show that personalized kinetic rate constants, rather than metabolite levels, better represent the genotype. Additionally, changes in erythrocyte dynamics between individuals occur on timescales of circulation, suggesting detected differences play a role in physiology. Finally, we use the models to identify individuals at risk for a drug side effect (ribavirin-induced anemia) and how genetic variation (inosine triphosphatase deficiency) may protect against this side effect. This study demonstrates the feasibility of personalized kinetic models, and we anticipate their use will accelerate discoveries in characterizing individual metabolic variation.
