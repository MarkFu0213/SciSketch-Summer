Abstract: It is well established that exercise could protect against myocardial infarction (MI). Previously, we found that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) could be induced by exercise and has been found to protect against MI via promoting angiogenic function of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). However, the underling mechanism of EETs in promoting EPC functions is unclear. C57BL/6 mice were fed with a novel soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor (sEHi), TPPU, to increase EET levels, for 1 week before undergoing MI surgery. Mice were then subjected to exercise training for 4 weeks. Bone marrow-derived EPCs were isolated and cultured in vitro. Exercise upregulated miR-126 expression but downregulated the protein levels of its target gene, Spred1, in EPCs from MI mice. TPPU further enhanced the effects of exercise on EPCs. Spred1 overexpression abolished the protective effects of TPPU on EPC functions. Downregulation of miR-126 by antagomiR-126 impaired the inhibitor effects of TPPU on Spred1 mRNA and protein expression. Additionally, TPPU upregulated miR-126 is partially mediated through ERK/p38 MAPK pathway. This study showed that sEHi promoted miR-126 expression, which might be related to the beneficial effect of sEHi on EPC functions in MI mice under exercise conditions, by increasing ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation and inhibiting Spred1.

Abstract: Summary
Current organoid technologies require intensive manual manipulation and lack uniformity in organoid size and cell composition. We present here an automated organoid platform that generates uniform organoid precursors in high-throughput. This is achieved by templating from monodisperse Matrigel droplets and sequentially delivering them into wells using a synchronized microfluidic droplet printer. Each droplet encapsulates a certain number of cells (e.g., 1,500 cells), which statistically represent the heterogeneous cell population in a tumor section. The system produces >400-μm organoids within 1 week with both inter-organoid homogeneity and inter-patient heterogeneity. This enables automated organoid printing to obtain one organoid per well. The organoids recapitulate 97% gene mutations in the parental tumor and reflect the patient-to-patient variation in drug response and sensitivity, from which we obtained more than 80% accuracy among the 21 patients investigated. This organoid platform is anticipated to fulfill the personalized medicine goal of 1-week high-throughput screening for cancer patients.

Abstract: Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs), can differentiate into all cell types in the body; therefore, they are used in the study of development and regenerative medicine. Neural lineage differentiation from PSCs is the initial step to study neurodevelopment and in vitro disease modeling. Brain organoids, which are composed of neural stem cells (NSCs) and differentiated neural lineage cell population, are a powerful in vitro system to mimic the brain tissue. Here, we aimed to establish a new method to generate brain organoids efficiently in a mouse model. We applied the in vivo teratoma formation method as a new approach to generate brain organoids. We induced teratoma formation using Sox1-GFP transgenic ESCs, in which green fluorescence protein (GFP) is expressed under the control of the early NSC marker Sox1. Sox1-GFP-expressing early NSCs were isolated as clumps and further cultured to generate brain organoids. Sox1-GFP ESC-derived brain organoids, composed of multiple layers of distinct cellular components (ventricle, ventricular zone, and cortical layer), were formed within 3 weeks of in vitro culture. We also found that neighboring cells (Sox1-GFP−) surrounding the Sox1-GFP+ clumps are essential for the formation of brain organoids. Thus, in vivo and in vitro conjugated systems–initial commitment in vivo and further specialization in vitro–could be one of the promising platforms for organoid formation that are universally applicable.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of elder people due to the degeneration of dopamine neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra. The clinical manifestations of PD include tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. Studying PD is challenging due to two obstacles: 1) disease models such as primary neurons or animal models usually couldn’t recapitulate the disease phenotype, and 2) accessibility of human autopsied brain samples is very limited if not impossible. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived neuronal cells from patients emerge as an ideal in vitro model for disease modeling and drug development. Here we describe a cell density-dependent method for preparing functional hiPSC-derived dopamine neurons (iDAs) with ~90% purity (TH-positive cells). iDAs derived from PD patient exhibit the disease-related phenotypes, for example, slowed morphogenesis, reduced dopamine release, impaired mitochondrial function, and α-synuclein accumulation as early as 35 days after induction. Furthermore, we found that the effects of cell density are different between iDA development stages, whereas high cell density increases stress for early neural progenitor cells (NPCs), but are neural-protective for mature iDAs, high density also favors morphogenesis. Hence, using stage and density-dependent strategies we can obtain high quality iDAs, which are critical for disease modeling, drug development and cell replacement therapy.

Abstract: Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor regulates several downstream signaling pathways upon EGF stimulation that involves cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Internalized EGF-receptor is either recycled or degraded, which fate is regulated in part by Ras interference 1 (RIN1). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that RIN1, a Ras effector protein and Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, controls several signaling molecules leading to the modulation of the telomerase activity; thus, allowing proper cell proliferation. We report that expression of RIN1 completely blocked proliferation of MCF-12 A and MCF-7 cells, while partially inhibited proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells upon EGF stimulation. Furthermore, expression of the C-terminal region of RIN1 selectively plays a critical role in the inhibition of the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. However, this inhibitory effect was specifically affected by the independent expression of RIN1:Vsp9 and RIN1:RA domains. Additionally, endogenous level of expression of RIN1 was decreased in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells as compared with non-tumorigenic MCF-12 A cells. We observed that expression of RIN1:R94A mutant blocked the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells, while expression of RIN1:Y561F and RIN1:R629A mutants completely reversed the inhibitory effect of RIN1:WT. Consistent with our observations, we found that expression of RIN1:WT in MDA-MB-231 cells diminished both protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activities while p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were unaffected, but it produced downregulation of cellular-myelocytomatosis (c-Myc), erythroblast transformation specific (Ets2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) activities. Inversely, expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMBG1) was inhibited whereas expression of forkhead box transcription factor 1 (FOXO1) was increased in cells expressing RIN1. Interestingly, expression of RIN1 blocked telomerase activity and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression, which correlated with the downregulations of c-Myc, Ets-2 and Stat3 activation. Taken together these findings indicate that RIN1 is a critical player in the modulation of the telomerase activity as well as hTERT expression in MDA-MB-231 cells upon EGF stimulation.

Abstract: Aquaporin 1 (AQP1), a transmembrane protein that forms water channels, has previously been shown to facilitate growth and progression of many types of tumors by modulating tumor cell migration, proliferation and angiogenesis. Here, we determined the impact of AQP1 expression in the tumor environment on the progression of brain tumors. Primary microglia from wild type(WT) and AQP1 knockout(KO) mice were used to test AQP1 effect on microglia function by using Western blot, quantative PCR, in an experimental in vivo mouse glioma model and organotypic brain slice culture. Deletion of AQP1 in the host tissue significantly reduced the survival of the mice implanted with GL261 glioma cells. The density of glioma-associated microglia/macrophages was almost doubled in AQP1KO mice. We found that factors secreted from GL261 cells decrease microglial AQP1 expression via the MEK/ERK pathway, and that inhibition of this pathway with Trametinib reduced tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor bearing mice, an effect which required the presence of microglia. Deletion of AQP1 in cultured microglia resulted in an increase in migratory activity and a decrease in TLR4-dependent innate immune responses. Our study demonstrates a functional relevance of AQP1 expression in microglia and hints to AQP1 as a potential novel target for glioma therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related death, and incidence is rising in younger populations (younger than 50 years). Current chemotherapies can achieve response rates above 50%, but immunotherapies have limited value for patients with microsatellite-stable (MSS) cancers. The present study investigates the impact of chemotherapy on the tumor immune microenvironment. We treat human liver metastases slices with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus either irinotecan or oxaliplatin, then perform single-cell transcriptome analyses. Results from eight cases reveal two cellular subtypes with divergent responses to chemotherapy. Susceptible tumors are characterized by a stemness signature, an activated interferon pathway, and suppression of PD-1 ligands in response to 5-FU+irinotecan. Conversely, immune checkpoint TIM-3 ligands are maintained or upregulated by chemotherapy in CRC with an enterocyte-like signature, and combining chemotherapy with TIM-3 blockade leads to synergistic tumor killing. Our analyses highlight chemomodulation of the immune microenvironment and provide a framework for combined chemo-immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) mediates viral entry into cells and is critical for vaccine development against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Structural studies have revealed distinct conformations of S, but real-time information that connects these structures is lacking. Here we apply single-molecule fluorescence (Förster) resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging to observe conformational dynamics of S on virus particles. Virus-associated S dynamically samples at least four distinct conformational states. In response to human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), S opens sequentially into the hACE2-bound S conformation through at least one on-path intermediate. Conformational preferences observed upon exposure to convalescent plasma or antibodies suggest mechanisms of neutralization involving either competition with hACE2 for binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or allosteric interference with conformational changes required for entry. Our findings inform on mechanisms of S recognition and conformations for immunogen design.

Abstract: Metabolism plays crucial roles in the fate decision of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Here, we show that the depletion of p53 in hESCs enhances glycolysis and reduces oxidative phosphorylation, and delays mesendoderm differentiation of hESCs. More intriguingly, the disruption of p53 in hESCs leads to dramatic upregulation of phosphatidylcholine and decrease of total choline in both pluripotent and differentiated state of hESCs, suggesting abnormal choline metabolism in the absence of p53. Collectively, our study reveals the indispensable role of p53 in orchestrating both glucose and lipid metabolism to maintain proper hESC identity.

Abstract: The muscle-intrinsic clock machinery is required for the maintenance of muscle growth, remodeling and function. Our previous studies demonstrated that the essential transcription activator of the molecular clock feed-back loop, Brain and Muscle Arnt-Like 1(Bmal1), plays a critical role in myogenic progenitor behavior to promote and regenerative myogenesis. Using genetic approaches targeting Bmal1 in the DMDmdx (mdx) dystrophic mouse model, here we report that the loss of Bmal1 function significantly accelerated dystrophic disease progression. In contrast to the mild dystrophic changes in mdx mice, the genetic loss-of-function of Bmal1 aggravated muscle damage in this dystrophic disease background, as indicated by persistently elevated creatine kinase levels, increased injury area and reduced muscle grip strength. Mechanistic studies revealed that markedly impaired myogenic progenitor proliferation and myogenic response underlie the defective new myofiber formation in the chronic dystrophic milieu. Taken together, our study identified the function of pro-myogenic clock gene Bmal1 in protecting against dystrophic damage, suggesting the potential for augmenting Bmal1 function to ameliorate dystrophic or degenerative muscle diseases.

Abstract: Directed cardiomyogenesis from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has been greatly improved in the last decade but directed differentiation to pacemaking cardiomyocytes (CMs) remains incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrated that inhibition of NODAL signaling by a specific NODAL inhibitor (SB431542) in the cardiac mesoderm differentiation stage downregulated PITX2c, a transcription factor that is known to inhibit the formation of the sinoatrial node in the left atrium during cardiac development. The resulting hiPSC-CMs were smaller in cell size, expressed higher pro-pacemaking transcription factors, TBX3 and TBX18, and exhibited pacemaking-like electrophysiological characteristics compared to control hiPSC-CMs differentiated from established Wnt-based protocol. The pacemaker-like subtype increased up to 2.4-fold in hiPSC-CMs differentiated with the addition of SB431542 relative to the control. Hence, Nodal inhibition in the cardiac mesoderm stage promoted pacemaker-like CM differentiation from hiPSCs. Improving the yield of human pacemaker-like CMs is a critical first step in the development of functional human cell-based biopacemakers.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the lipid transport protein ABCA12 cause the life-threatening skin condition harlequin ichthyosis (HI), which is characterized by the loss of skin barrier function, inflammation, and dehydration. Inflammatory responses in HI increase disease severity by impairing keratinocyte differentiation, suggesting amelioration of this phenotype as a possible therapy for the condition. Existing treatments for HI are based around the use of retinoids, but their value in treating patients during the neonatal period has been questioned relative to other improved management regimens, and their long-term use is associated with side effects. We have developed a conditional mouse model to demonstrate that topical application of the aminosalicylic acid derivatives 5ASA or 4ASA considerably improves HI keratinocyte differentiation without the undesirable side effects of the retinoid acitretin and salicylic acid (aspirin). Analysis of changes in gene expression shows that 4ASA in particular elicits compensatory upregulation of a large family of barrier function-related genes, many of which are associated with other ichthyoses, identifying this compound as a lead candidate for developing topical treatments for HI.

Abstract: Cartilage acid protein 1 (CRTAC1) encodes a protein containing the Ca2+binding domain, which can promote apoptosis of human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) induced by ultraviolet B radiation. Exosomes secreted from adipose-derived stem cells (ASC-exo) have been used to treat many diseases, but the effect of ASC-exo on cataracts has not been established. We hypothesized that ASC-exo has a therapeutic effect on cataracts by regulating CRTAC1. We established the UVB-induced injured HLECs model to test the interactions between CRTAC1 and miR-10a-5p, and the effect on the Ca2+ level and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in apoptotic HLECs. We found that UVB significantly increased the level of CRTAC1 expression and induced HLEC apoptosis, while ASC-exo inhibited the induction of UVB and exosome inhibitor reduced the inhibition of ASC-exo. The qRT-PCR results showed that miR-10a-5p had a low level of expression in cataract lesions, whereas CRTAC1 was highly expressed. There was a negative correlation between the expression of CRTAC1 and miR-10a-5p. ASC-exo reversed UVB-inhibited miR-10a-5p expression and miR-10a-5p negatively regulated CRTAC1. In vitro data showed that miR-10a-5p reversed UVB-induced ROS, apoptosis, and the Ca2+ level in HLECs. Overexpression of CRTAC1 reversed the induction of ASC-exo in UVB-injured HLECs, and low expression of CRTAC1 reversed the induction of miR-10a-5p inhibitor. By upregulating the level of miR-10a-5p expression and downregulating the level of CRTAC1 expression, exosomes from ASCs attenuated UVB-induced apoptosis, ROS generation, and the Ca2+ level in HLECs. Our research provides novel insight into the treatment methods and associated mechanisms underlying cataracts.

Abstract: Summary
Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has historically been linked to heterochromatin organization, and in mouse cells it accumulates at pericentric heterochromatin (PCH), closely following major satellite (MajSat) DNA distribution. However, little is known about the specific function of MeCP2 in these regions. We describe the first evidence of a role in neurons for MeCP2 and MajSat forward (MajSat-fw) RNA in reciprocal targeting to PCH through their physical interaction. Moreover, MeCP2 contributes to maintenance of PCH by promoting deposition of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3. We highlight that the MeCP2B isoform is required for correct higher-order PCH organization, and underline involvement of the methyl-binding and transcriptional repression domains. The T158 residue, which is commonly mutated in Rett patients, is directly involved in this process. Our findings support the hypothesis that MeCP2 and the MajSat-fw transcript are mutually dependent for PCH organization, and contribute to clarify MeCP2 function in the regulation of chromatin architecture.

Abstract: Summary
Stress is a known trigger for flares of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, this process is not well understood. Here, we find that restraint stress in mice leads to signs of diarrhea, fecal dysbiosis, and a barrier defect via the opening of goblet-cell associated passages. Notably, stress increases host immunity to gut bacteria as assessed by immunoglobulin A (IgA)-bound gut bacteria. Stress-induced microbial changes are necessary and sufficient to elicit these effects. Moreover, similar to mice, many diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients from two cohorts display increased antibacterial immunity as assessed by IgA-bound fecal bacteria. This antibacterial IgA response in IBS-D correlates with somatic symptom severity and was distinct from healthy controls or IBD patients. These findings suggest that stress may play an important role in patients with IgA-associated IBS-D by disrupting the intestinal microbial community that alters gastrointestinal function and host immunity to commensal bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal translocations are prevalent among soft tissue tumors, including those of the vasculature such as pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE). PHE shows endothelial cell (EC) features and has a tumor-specific t(7;19)(q22;q13) SERPINE1-FOSB translocation, but is difficult to study as no primary tumor cell lines have yet been derived. Here, we engineer the PHE chromosomal translocation into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using CRISPR/Cas9 and differentiate these into ECs (hiPSC-ECs) to address this. Comparison of parental with PHE hiPSC-ECs shows (1) elevated expression of FOSB, (2) higher proliferation and more tube formation but lower endothelial barrier function, (3) invasive growth and abnormal vessel formation in mice after transplantation, and (4) specific transcriptome alterations reflecting PHE and indicating PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways as possible therapeutic targets. The modified hiPSC-ECs thus recapitulate functional features of PHE and demonstrate how these translocation models can be used to understand tumorigenic mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Blood coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is a key cofactor in regulation of blood coagulation. This study investigated the mechanism by which FVIII is translated and transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and processed in the Golgi apparatus before secretion using an in vitro cell model. HEK-293T cells were transfected with vectors carrying wild-type (WT) FVIII or polymorphic FVIII D1241E for coexpression with ER lectins and treatment with tunicamycin (an N-linked glycosylation inhibitor), 1-deoxynojirimycin (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor), endoglycosidase H, or MG132 (Cbz-Leu-Leu-leucinal; a proteasome inhibitor). The data showed that the minor allele of FVIII D1241E was able to reduce FVIII secretion into the conditioned medium but maintain a normal level of procoagulation ability, although both FVIII WT and the minor allele of FVIII D1241E showed similar levels of transcription and translation capacities. Functionally, the D1241E polymorphism led to a reduced level of FVIII in the Golgi apparatus because of its reduced association with malectin, which interacts with newly synthesized glycoproteins in the ER for FVIII folding and trafficking, leading to degradation of the minor allele of FVIII D1241E in the cytosol. This study demonstrated that malectin is important for regulation of the FVIII posttranslational process and that the minor allele of FVIII D1241E had a reduced association with malectin but an increased capacity for proteasomal FVIII degradation. These data imply the role of the ER quality control in future recombinant FVIII development.

Abstract: SIPA1, a GTPase activating protein that negatively regulates Ras-related protein (Rap), is a potential modulator of tumor metastasis and recurrence. In this study, we first showed that SIPA1 facilitated the stemness features of breast cancer cells, such as of tumorsphere formation capability and the expression of stemness marker CD44. In addition, SIPA1 promoted the expression of four stemness-associated transcription factors through increasing the expression of SMAD2 and SMAD3 in vitro and in vivo. The stemness features were abolished by blocking the phosphorylation of SMAD3 with its specific inhibitor SIS3. Furthermore, SIPA1 decreased the breast cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. This effect was, however, competitively reversed by blocking the SMAD3 phosphorylation by SIS3 treatment in breast cancer cells. Taken together, SIPA1 promotes and sustains the stemness of breast cancer cells and their resistance to chemotherapy by increasing the expression of SMAD2 and SMAD3, and blocking SMAD3 phosphorylation could suppress the cancer cell stemness and increase the sensitivity to chemotherapy in breast cancer cells expressing a high level of SIPA1.

Abstract: The fundamental question about the functionality of in vitro derived human primordial germ cell-like cells remains unanswered, despite ongoing research in this area. Attempts have been made to imitate the differentiation of human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) and meiocytes in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). A defined system for developing human haploid cells in vitro is the challenge that scientists face to advance the knowledge of human germ cell development. To develop human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that are capable of giving rise to haploid cells, we applied a sequential induction protocol via the early mesodermal push of female human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. BMP4-induced early mesoderm-like cells showed significant alterations in their expression profiles toward early (PRDM1 and NANOS3) and late (VASA and DAZL) germ cell markers. Furthermore, using retinoic acid (RA), we induced hPGCLCs in embryoid bodies and identified positive staining for the meiotic initiation marker STRA8. Efforts to find the cells exhibiting progression to meiosis were unsuccessful. The validation by the expression of SCP3 did not correspond to the natural pattern. Regarding the 20-day meiotic induction, the derived hPGCLCs containing two X-chromosomes were unable to complete the meiotic division. We observed the expression of the oocyte marker PIWIL1 and PIWIL4. RNAseq analysis and cluster dendrogram showed a similar clustering of hPGCLC groups and meiotic like cell groups as compared to previously published data. This reproducible in vitro model for deriving hPGCLCs provides opportunities for studying the molecular mechanisms involved in the specification of hPGCs. Moreover, our results will support a further elucidation of gametogenesis and meiosis of female hPGCs.

Abstract: Meningothelial cells (MECs) are the cellular component of the meninges that provide physical protection to the central nervous system (CNS). Their main function is the formation of a barrier enclosing the brain including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Further, MECs are involved in maintaining CSF homeostasis by clearing CSF from bacteria and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involves MECs in immunological processes in the CNS. We demonstrated that meningothelial Ben-Men-1 cells ingest neurotoxic peptides amyloid-β (Aβ1-40) and protein α-synuclein up to about 10-fold more efficiently compared to neuronal-like SH-SY5Y cells. Aβ1-40 and α-synuclein are mainly taken up via macropinocytosis. Caveolar endocytosis in addition contributes to α-synuclein ingestion. Upon uptake, both are trafficked towards lysosomal degradation. While production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following exposure to Aβ25-35 and α-synuclein was similar between Ben-Men-1 and SH-SY5Y cells, mitochondrial function in Ben-Men-1 was significantly more robust to Aβ25-35 treatment compared to neuronal-like SHSY5Y cells. Similarly, Ben-Men-1 were significantly less susceptible to Aβ25-35-induced cell death than neuronal-like cells. Furthermore, co-culture with Ben-Men-1 offered significant protection to neuronal-like cells against Aβ25-35-induced apoptosis. This study reveals for the first time the function of MECs as scavengers of neurotoxic Aβ and α-synuclein, thereby connecting these cells to neuroprotective processes and suggesting a new mechanism and pathway for clearing neurotoxic substances from the CSF.

Abstract: To investigate the role of placental growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (PlGF-VEGF) heterodimers are involved in the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown and the associated mechanism, human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were treated with recombinant human (rh)PlGF-VEGF heterodimers and rhPlGF and studied in normal and high-glucose conditions. HREC barrier function was evaluated by the measurement of trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Adeno-Associated Virus Type 5 (AAV5) vectors overexpressed PlGF in the retina by intravitreal injection into the C57BL6 mouse eye. AAV5-GFP vector and naïve animals were used as controls. Immunofluorescence (IF) and western blots examined the protein expression of PlGF-VEGF heterodimers, VEGF, PlGF, NFκB, p-IκBα, ZO-1, and VE-cadherin in HREC and mouse retina. PlGF-VEGF heterodimers were detected predominantly in the HREC cell nuclei based on IF and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation experiments. High glucose treatment increased PlGF-VEGF nuclear abundance. Dot immunoblotting demonstrated a strong affinity of the 5D11D4 antibody to PlGF-VEGF heterodimers. rhPlGF-VEGF disrupted the barrier function of HREC, which was prevented by the neutralization of PlGF-VEGF by the 5D11D4 antibody. Stimulation of HRECs with rhPlGF also led to an increase in the nuclear signals for PlGF-VEGF, p-IκBα, and colocalization of NFκB p65 and PlGF-VEGF in the nuclei. The selective IKK2 inhibitor IMD0354 disrupted the nuclear colocalization. Treatment with IMD0354 restored the barrier function of HREC, as indicated by the ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression. In the mouse retinas, PlGF overexpression by AAV5 vector reduced ZO-1 expression and increased abundance of pIκBα. PIGF/VEGF heterodimers mediate BRB breakdown potentially through the canonical NFκB activation.

Abstract: Due to the multi-potential differentiation and immunomodulatory function, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the therapy of chronic and autoimmune diseases. Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown to be a global public health emergency but no effective drug is available to date. Several studies investigated MSCs therapy for COVID-19 patients. However, it remains unclear whether MSCs could be the host cells of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) and whether they might affect the SARS-CoV-2 entry into other cells. Here, we report that human MSCs barely express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two receptors required for the virus endocytosis, indicating that MSCs are free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we observed that MSCs were unable to induce the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in epithelial cells and macrophages. Importantly, under different inflammatory challenge conditions, implanted human MSCs failed to up-regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung tissues of mice. Intriguingly, we showed that a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus failed to infect MSCs and co-cultured MSCs did not increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in epithelial cells. All these results suggest that human MSCs have no risk of assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the use of MSCs as the therapy for COVID-19 patients is feasible and safe.

Abstract: Cryopreservation is used for long-term storage of cells and tissues. Cryoprotectants such as dimethyl disulfoxide (DMSO) are used to protect cells against freeze-thaw damage. Despite the use of cryoprotectants, hepatocytes are sensitive to stresses imposed by freeze and thaw processes, which cause physical damage, loss of functionality, or cell death. As an alternative, we have developed new technology using several recombinant wheat proteins as cryoprotectants: TaENO (enolase), TaBAS1 (2-Cys peroxiredoxin), and a combination of WCS120 (dehydrin) with TaIRI-2 (inhibitor of ice recrystallization). This study aims to understand the mechanisms by which these plant proteins protect rat hepatocytes against cell death incurred during cryopreservation. Our analysis revealed that for cells cryopreserved with DMSO, cell death occurred by apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis was detected by activation of effector caspases-3 and -7, PARP cleavage, and nuclear chromatin condensation. These apoptotic events were inhibited when hepatocytes were cryopreserved with the different plant proteins. Cryopreservation with DMSO activated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway: the Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio increased, mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, and initiator caspase-9 was activated. Furthermore, the endoplasmic reticulum pathway of apoptosis was activated: levels of the chaperone Bip/GRP78 decreased, pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP was induced, and initiator caspase-12 was activated. Activation of the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum pathways of apoptosis was attenuated when hepatocytes were cryopreserved with the different recombinant proteins. This study improves understanding of mechanisms of cryoprotection provided by these plant proteins during freezing stress. These proteins are natural products and show promising potential by decreasing cell death during cryopreservation of hepatocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular identity is ultimately dictated by the interaction of transcription factors with regulatory elements (REs) to control gene expression. Advances in epigenome profiling techniques have significantly increased our understanding of cell-specific utilization of REs. However, it remains difficult to dissect the majority of factors that interact with these REs due to the lack of appropriate techniques. Therefore, we developed TINC: TALE-mediated isolation of nuclear chromatin. Using this new method, we interrogated the protein complex formed at the Nanog promoter in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and identified many known and previously unknown interactors, including RCOR2. Further interrogation of the role of RCOR2 in ESCs revealed its involvement in the repression of lineage genes and the fine-tuning of pluripotency genes. Consequently, using the Nanog promoter as a paradigm, we demonstrated the power of TINC to provide insight into the molecular makeup of specific transcriptional complexes at individual REs as well as into cellular identity control in general.

Abstract: Summary
Combination immunotherapy with antibodies directed against PD-1 and CTLA-4 shows improved clinical benefit across cancer indications compared to single agents, albeit with increased toxicity. Leveraging the observation that PD-1 and CTLA-4 are co-expressed by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, an investigational PD-1 x CTLA-4 bispecific DART molecule, MGD019, is engineered to maximize checkpoint blockade in the tumor microenvironment via enhanced CTLA-4 blockade in a PD-1-binding-dependent manner. In vitro, MGD019 mediates the combinatorial blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4, confirming dual inhibition via a single molecule. MGD019 is well tolerated in non-human primates, with evidence of both PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade, including increases in Ki67+CD8 and ICOS+CD4 T cells, respectively. In the ongoing MGD019 first-in-human study enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT03761017), an analysis undertaken following the dose escalation phase revealed acceptable safety, pharmacodynamic evidence of combinatorial blockade, and objective responses in multiple tumor types typically unresponsive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The approval of the first kinase inhibitor, Gleevec, ushered in a paradigm shift for oncological treatment—the use of genomic data for targeted, efficacious therapies. Since then, over 48 additional small-molecule kinase inhibitors have been approved, solidifying the case for kinases as a highly druggable and attractive target class. Despite the role deregulated kinase activity plays in cancer, only 8% of the kinome has been effectively “drugged.” Moreover, 24% of the 634 human kinases are understudied. We have developed a comprehensive scoring system that utilizes differential gene expression, pathological parameters, overall survival, and mutational hotspot analysis to rank and prioritize clinically relevant kinases across 17 solid tumor cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We have developed the clinical kinase index (CKI) app (http://cki.ccs.miami.edu) to facilitate interactive analysis of all kinases in each cancer. Collectively, we report that understudied kinases have potential clinical value as biomarkers or drug targets that warrant further study.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence obtained over the last three decades has revealed a neuroendocrine system in the brain that mediates long term increases in blood pressure. The system involves distinct ion transport pathways including the alpha-2 isoform of the Na,K pump and epithelial sodium channels, as well as critical hormone elements such as angiotensin II, aldosterone, mineralocorticoid receptors and endogenous ouabain. Activation of this system either by circulating or central sodium ions and/or angiotensin II leads to a cascading sequence of events that begins in the hypothalamus and involves the participation of several brain nuclei including the subfornical organ, supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and the rostral ventral medulla. Key events include heightened aldosterone synthesis and mineralocorticoid receptor activation, upregulation of epithelial sodium channels, augmented synthesis and secretion of endogenous ouabain from hypothalamic magnocellular neurons, and sustained increases in sympathetic outflow. The latter step depends upon increased production of angiotensin II and the primary amplification of angiotensin II type I receptor signaling from the paraventricular nucleus to the rostral ventral lateral medulla. The transmission of sympathetic traffic is secondarily amplified in the periphery by increased short- and long-term potentiation in sympathetic ganglia and by sustained actions of endogenous ouabain in the vascular wall that augment expression of sodium calcium exchange, increase cytosolic Ca2+ and heighten myogenic tone and contractility. Upregulation of this multi-amplifier system participates in forms of hypertension where salt, angiotensin and/or aldosterone are elevated and contributes to adverse outcomes in heart failure.

Abstract: Summary
Pioneer transcription factors (pTFs) bind to target sites within compact chromatin, initiating chromatin remodeling and controlling the recruitment of downstream factors. The mechanisms by which pTFs overcome the chromatin barrier are not well understood. Here, we reveal, using single-molecule fluorescence, how the yeast transcription factor Rap1 invades and remodels chromatin. Using a reconstituted chromatin system replicating yeast promoter architecture, we demonstrate that Rap1 can bind nucleosomal DNA within a chromatin fiber but with shortened dwell times compared to naked DNA. Moreover, we show that Rap1 binding opens chromatin fiber structure by inhibiting inter-nucleosome contacts. Finally, we reveal that Rap1 collaborates with the chromatin remodeler RSC to displace promoter nucleosomes, paving the way for long-lived bound states on newly exposed DNA. Together, our results provide a mechanistic view of how Rap1 gains access and opens chromatin, thereby establishing an active promoter architecture and controlling gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence suggests Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology is influenced by primary and secondary bile acids, the end product of cholesterol metabolism. We analyze 2,114 post-mortem brain transcriptomes and identify genes in the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway to be expressed in the brain. A targeted metabolomic analysis of primary and secondary bile acids measured from post-mortem brain samples of 111 individuals supports these results. Our metabolic network analysis suggests that taurine transport, bile acid synthesis, and cholesterol metabolism differ in AD and cognitively normal individuals. We also identify putative transcription factors regulating metabolic genes and influencing altered metabolism in AD. Intriguingly, some bile acids measured in brain tissue cannot be explained by the presence of enzymes responsible for their synthesis, suggesting that they may originate from the gut microbiome and are transported to the brain. These findings motivate further research into bile acid metabolism in AD to elucidate their possible connection to cognitive decline.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive disease, despite recent improvements in therapy. Eradicating all melanoma cells even in drug-sensitive tumors is unsuccessful in patients because a subset of cells can transition to a slow-cycling state, rendering them resistant to most targeted therapy. It is still unclear what pathways define these subpopulations and promote this resistant phenotype. In the current study, we show that Wnt5A, a non-canonical Wnt ligand that drives a metastatic, therapy-resistant phenotype, stabilizes the half-life of p53 and uses p53 to initiate a slow-cycling state following stress (DNA damage, targeted therapy, and aging). Inhibiting p53 blocks the slow-cycling phenotype and sensitizes melanoma cells to BRAF/MEK inhibition. In vivo, this can be accomplished with a single dose of p53 inhibitor at the commencement of BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy. These data suggest that taking the paradoxical approach of inhibiting rather than activating wild-type p53 may sensitize previously resistant metastatic melanoma cells to therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulation of CD103+CD8+ resident memory T (TRM) cells in human lung tumors has been associated with a favorable prognosis. However, the contribution of TRM to anti-tumor immunity and to the response to immune checkpoint blockade has not been clearly established. Using quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence on cohorts of non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1, we show that an increased density of CD103+CD8+ lymphocytes in immunotherapy-naive tumors is associated with greatly improved outcomes. The density of CD103+CD8+ cells increases during immunotherapy in most responder, but not in non-responder, patients. CD103+CD8+ cells co-express CD49a and CD69 and display a molecular profile characterized by the expression of PD-1 and CD39. CD103+CD8+ tumor TRM, but not CD103−CD8+ tumor-infiltrating counterparts, express Aiolos, phosphorylated STAT-3, and IL-17; demonstrate enhanced proliferation and cytotoxicity toward autologous cancer cells; and frequently display oligoclonal expansion of TCR-β clonotypes. These results explain why CD103+CD8+ TRM are associated with better outcomes in anti-PD-(L)1-treated patients.

Abstract: Salivary epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in the maintenance of the oral and gastro-esophageal mucosa. Sialoadenectomy delays healing of oral wounds and affects lingual papillae. In this work, we aimed to determine the effect of EGF deficiency induced by sialoadenectomy and evaluate the effect of exogenous EGF administration on the lingual papillae and taste buds in rats. Thirty male adult Wistar albino rats were equally divided into 3 groups; sham-operated control group, sialoadenectomy group and group of sialoadenectomy + EGF. EGF was given 8 weeks after sialoadenectomy in a dose of 1 μg /ml/day in drinking water for 2 weeks. The anterior two-thirds of the tongue was dissected and cut longitudinally into two halves; one half for light microscope and the other for electron microscope examinations. Saliva and blood were collected to determine salivary and plasma EGF. Our results revealed that sialoadenectomy significantly reduced plasma and saliva levels of EGF which resulted in severe disruption of the architecture of lingual papillae. These changes were effectively improved by the exogenous EGF administration. In conclusion, EGF supplementation reversed the effects of sialoadenectomy and restored almost normal architecture of lingual papillae and taste buds.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro spermatogenesis has been achieved by culturing mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) together with a cell suspension of male juvenile gonad. However, for human fertility treatment or preservation, patient-specific ESCs or juvenile gonad is not available. We therefore aim to achieve in vitro spermatogenesis using male germline stem cells (GSCs) without the use of juvenile gonad. GSCs, when cultured on immortalized Sertoli cells, were able to enter meiosis, reach the meiotic metaphase stages, and sporadically form spermatid-like cells. However, the in vitro-formed pachytene-like spermatocytes did not display full chromosome synapsis and did not form meiotic crossovers. Despite this, the meiotic checkpoints that usually eliminate such cells to prevent genomic instabilities from being transmitted to the offspring were not activated, allowing the cells to proceed to the meiotic metaphase stages. In vitro-generated spermatid-like cells should thus be thoroughly investigated before being considered for clinical use.

Abstract: Activation of STAT3 via Y705-phosphorylation is well documented across multiple cancer types and thus forms the basis of canonical pathway to judge STAT3 activation. Recently, important roles of two other post translational modification (PTM) sites, i.e. S727-phosphorylation and K685-acetylation, leading to STAT3 activation are reported. However, their critical mode of function in controlling STAT3 dimerization and signaling, independent of canonical activation remains elusive. Therefore, to understand the functional relevance of each STAT3 PTMs in breast cancer (BC), cell models are developed by stable overexpression of PTM-site specific point mutants, i.e. Y705F, S727A or K685R, in a 3′UTR-STAT3 knockdown BC cell background. Results using this model system reveal novel findings showing that phosphorylation at S727 can lead to STAT3 activation independent of phosphoY705. We also demonstrate that loss of pS727 or K685ac significantly affects functional phenotypes such as cell survival and proliferation as well as downstream transcriptional activity (Twist 1, Socs3, c-Myc, Bcl-1 and Mcl-1) of STAT3. Thereafter, by utilizing a BRET biosensor for measuring STAT3 phosphorylation in live cells, a crucial role of pS727 in dictating STAT3 activation and homodimerization formation is uncovered. Further by performing retrospective IHC analysis of total and phospho-forms of STAT3 in a cohort of 76 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient samples, a significant dominant expression of phosphoS727 over phosphoY705 PTM (p < 0.001) is found in STAT3 positive cases. We also focus on validating known STAT3 inhibitor molecules for their action against both pY705 and pS727 activation. This study for the first time demonstrates that an anti-helminth drug compound, Niclosamide, is capable of inactivating both phospho-PTM sites on STAT3 and exhibits excellent anticancer efficacy in preclinical TNBC tumour model.

Abstract: Summary
The tetravalent live attenuated dengue vaccine candidate TV003 induces neutralizing antibodies against all four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1–DENV4) and protects against experimental challenge with DENV2 in humans. Here, we track vaccine viremia and B and T cell responses to this vaccination/challenge model to understand how vaccine viremia links adaptive immunity and development of protective antibody responses. TV003 viremia triggers an acute plasmablast response that, in combination with DENV-specific CD4+ T cells, correlates with serum neutralizing antibodies. TV003 vaccinees develop DENV2-reactive memory B cells, including serotype-specific and multivalent specificities in line with the composition of serum antibodies. There is no post-challenge plasmablast response in vaccinees, although stronger and earlier post-TV003 plasmablast responses associate with sterile humoral protection from DENV2 challenge. TV003 vaccine triggers plasmablasts and memory B cells, which, with support from CD4+ T cells, functionally link early vaccine viremia and the serum antibody responses.

Abstract: Summary
Prevotella spp. are a dominant bacterial genus within the human gut. Multiple Prevotella spp. co-exist in some individuals, particularly those consuming plant-based diets. Additionally, Prevotella spp. exhibit variability in the utilization of diverse complex carbohydrates. To investigate the relationship between Prevotella competition and diet, we isolated Prevotella species from the mouse gut, analyzed their genomes and transcriptomes in vivo, and performed competition experiments between species in mice. Diverse dominant Prevotella species compete for similar metabolic niches in vivo, which is linked to the upregulation of specific polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs). Complex plant-derived polysaccharides are required for Prevotella spp. expansion, with arabinoxylans having a prominent impact on species abundance. The most dominant Prevotella species encodes a specific tandem-repeat trsusC/D PUL that enables arabinoxylan utilization and is conserved in human Prevotella copri strains, particularly among those consuming a vegan diet. These findings suggest that efficient (arabino)xylan-utilization is a factor contributing to Prevotella dominance.

Abstract: Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic ribonucleoprotein granules induced by environmental stresses. They play an important role in the stress response by integrating mRNA stability, translation, and signaling pathways. Recent work has connected SG dysfunction to neurodegenerative diseases. In these diseases, SG dynamics are impaired because of mutations in SG proteins or protein quality control factors. Impaired SG dynamics and delayed SG dissolution have also been observed for SGs that accumulate misfolding-prone defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). DRiP accumulation inside SGs is controlled by a surveillance system referred to as granulostasis and encompasses the molecular chaperones VCP and the HSPB8-BAG3-HSP70 complex. BAG3 is a member of the BAG family of proteins, which includes five additional members. One of these proteins, BAG6, is functionally related to BAG3 and able to assist degradation of DRiPs. However, whether BAG6 is involved in granulostasis is unknown. We report that BAG6 is not recruited into SGs induced by different types of stress, nor does it affect SG dynamics. BAG6 also does not replace BAG3’s function in SG granulostasis. We show that BAG3 and BAG6 target different subsets of DRiPs, and BAG3 binding to DRiPs is mediated by HSPB8 and HSP70. Our data support the idea that SGs are sensitive to BAG3-HSP70-bound DRiPs but not to BAG6-bound DRiPs. Additionally, only BAG3 is strongly upregulated in the stress recovery phase, when SGs dissolve. These data exclude a role for BAG6 in granulostasis and point to a more specialized function in the clearance of a specific subset of DRiPs.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in KCNH2 can lead to long QT syndrome type 2. Variable disease manifestation observed with this channelopathy is associated with the location and type of mutation within the protein, complicating efforts to predict patient risk. Here, we demonstrated phenotypic differences in cardiomyocytes derived from isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) genetically edited to harbor mutations either within the pore or tail region of the ion channel. Electrophysiological analysis confirmed that the mutations prolonged repolarization of the hiPSC-CMs, with differences between the mutations evident in monolayer cultures. Blocking the hERG channel revealed that the pore-loop mutation conferred greater susceptibility to arrhythmic events. These findings showed that subtle phenotypic differences related to KCNH2 mutations could be captured by hiPSC-CMs under genetically matched conditions. Moreover, the results support hiPSC-CMs as strong candidates for evaluating the underlying severity of individual KCNH2 mutations in humans, which could facilitate patient risk stratification.

Abstract: Several generations of cardiac physiologists have verified that basal cardiac contractility depends strongly on the transsarcolemmal Na gradient, and the underlying molecular mechanisms that link cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) to the Na gradient have been elucidated in good detail for more than 30 years. In brief, small increases of cytoplasmic Na push cardiac (NCX1) Na/Ca exchangers to increase contractility by increasing the myocyte Ca load. Accordingly, basal cardiac contractility is expected to be physiologically regulated by pathways that modify the cardiac Na gradient and the function of Na transporters. Assuming that this expectation is correct, it remains to be elucidated how in detail signaling pathways affecting the cardiac Na gradient are controlled in response to changing cardiac output requirements. Some puzzle pieces that may facilitate progress are outlined in this short review. Key open issues include (1) whether the concept of local Na gradients is viable, (2) how in detail Na channels, Na transporters and Na/K pumps are regulated by lipids and metabolic processes, (3) the physiological roles of Na/K pump inactivation, and (4) the possibility that key diffusible signaling molecules remain to be discovered.

Abstract: By observing the dynamic changes of extracellular histones H1, H2A, H4, and NF-κB expression in brain tissues after brain injury in rats, we explore the association among the expression of extracellular histones H1, H2A, H4, and NF-κB following traumatic brain injury (TBI), as well as the effect of different atmospheres absolute hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) intervention on the expression and possible mechanisms. A total of 120 SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Sham-operated (SH), TBI (traumatic brain injury) group, traumatic brain injury and hyperbaric oxygen treatment 1.6ATA (TBI + HBO1) group, and traumatic brain injury and hyperbaric oxygen treatment2.2ATA (TBI + HBO2) group, with 30 rats in each group. The rats in each group were then randomly divided into five smaller time-specific sub-groups: 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h after surgery. TBI models were established, and the brain tissue around the lesion was taken at different time points. On the one hand,we detected the level of local histones H1, H2A, H4, and NF-κB by RT-PCR and Western Blot. On the other hand, we used immunohistochemical methods to detect the expression of NF-κB, while using the TUNEL method to observe the cell apoptosis in experimental groups after brain injury. Extracellular histones H1, H2A, H4, and NF-κB proteins were highly expressed at 3 h, then with a slight fluctuation, reached to peak at 48 h after the injury. HBO can affect the expression of histones H1, H2A, H4, and NF-κB. The decline of each indicator in the 1.6ATA group was significantly lower than that in the 2.2ATA group, especially within 6 h (P < 0. 05). In addition, NF-κB expression was consistent with the pathological changes of apoptosis in experimental groups. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy with relatively low pressure (1.6ATA) at the early stage can significantly inhibit the expression of extracellular histones H1, H2A, H4, and NF-κB around the lesion, reduce the apoptosis of nerve cells, and thus play an important role in alleviating secondary brain injury.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, chromatin organization undergoes drastic reorganization during oocyte development. However, the dynamics of three-dimensional chromatin structure in this process is poorly characterized. Using low-input Hi-C (genome-wide chromatin conformation capture), we found that a unique chromatin organization gradually appears during mouse oocyte growth. Oocytes at late stages show self-interacting, cohesin-independent compartmental domains marked by H3K27me3, therefore termed Polycomb-associating domains (PADs). PADs and inter-PAD (iPAD) regions form compartment-like structures with strong inter-domain interactions among nearby PADs. PADs disassemble upon meiotic resumption from diplotene arrest but briefly reappear on the maternal genome after fertilization. Upon maternal depletion of Eed, PADs are largely intact in oocytes, but their reestablishment after fertilization is compromised. By contrast, depletion of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) proteins attenuates PADs in oocytes, which is associated with substantial gene de-repression in PADs. These data reveal a critical role of Polycomb in regulating chromatin architecture during mammalian oocyte growth and early development.

Abstract: Summary
The rodent olfactory bulb (OB) is continuously supplied with adult-born cells maturing into GABAergic neurons. Using in vivo ratiometric Ca2+ imaging to readout ongoing and sensory-driven activity, we asked whether mature adult-born cells (mABCs) in the glomerular layer of the bulb become functionally identical to resident GABAergic (ResGABA) neurons. In awake head-restrained mice the two cell populations differed significantly in terms of ongoing spontaneous activity, with 24% of mABCs contributing to a strongly active cell cluster, absent among ResGABA cells. Odor-evoked responses of mABCs were sparse, less reliable, and had smaller amplitudes compared with ResGABA cells. The opposite was seen under anesthesia, with response reliability increasing and response size of mABCs becoming larger than that of ResGABA cells. Furthermore, ongoing activity of mABCs showed increased sensitivity to ketamine/xylazine and was selectively blocked by the antagonist of serotonin receptors methysergide. These functional features of mABCs clearly distinguish them from other OB interneurons.

Abstract: Summary
Pioneering microbial genomic surveys have revealed numerous untapped biosynthetic gene clusters, unveiling the great potential of new natural products. Here, using a combination of genome mining, mutasynthesis, and activity screening in an infection model comprising Caenorhabditis elegans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we identified candidate virulence-blocking amychelin siderophore compounds from actinomycetes. Subsequently, we developed unreported analogs of these virulence-blocking siderophores with improved potency by exploiting an Amycolatopsis methanolica strain 239T chorismate to salicylate a biosynthetic subpathway for mutasynthesis. This allowed us to generate the fluorinated amychelin, fluoroamychelin I, which rescued C. elegans from P. aeruginosa-mediated killing with an EC50 value of 1.4 μM, outperforming traditional antibiotics including ceftazidime and meropenem. In general, this paper describes an efficient platform for the identification and production of classes of anti-microbial compounds with potential unique modes of action.

Abstract: Summary
The histone chaperone FACT and histone H2B ubiquitination (H2Bub) facilitate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) passage through chromatin, yet it is not clear how they cooperate mechanistically. We used genomics, genetic, biochemical, and microscopic approaches to dissect their interplay in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show that FACT and H2Bub globally repress antisense transcripts near the 5′ end of genes and inside gene bodies, respectively. The accumulation of these transcripts is accompanied by changes at genic nucleosomes and Pol II redistribution. H2Bub is required for FACT activity in genic regions. In the H2Bub mutant, FACT binding to chromatin is altered and its association with histones is stabilized, which leads to the reduction of genic nucleosomes. Interestingly, FACT depletion globally restores nucleosomes in the H2Bub mutant. Moreover, in the absence of Pob3, the FACT Spt16 subunit controls the 3′ end of genes. Furthermore, FACT maintains nucleosomes in subtelomeric regions, which is crucial for their compaction.

Abstract: Summary
Apicomplexan parasites cause major human disease and food insecurity. They owe their considerable success to highly specialized cell compartments and structures. These adaptations drive their recognition, nondestructive penetration, and elaborate reengineering of the host’s cells to promote their growth, dissemination, and the countering of host defenses. The evolution of unique apicomplexan cellular compartments is concomitant with vast proteomic novelty. Consequently, half of apicomplexan proteins are unique and uncharacterized. Here, we determine the steady-state subcellular location of thousands of proteins simultaneously within the globally prevalent apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. This provides unprecedented comprehensive molecular definition of these unicellular eukaryotes and their specialized compartments, and these data reveal the spatial organizations of protein expression and function, adaptation to hosts, and the underlying evolutionary trajectories of these pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Activating KRAS mutations are found in over 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs), yet KRAS has remained a difficult target to inhibit pharmacologically. Here, we demonstrate, using several human and mouse models of PDACs, rapid acquisition of tumor resistance in response to targeting KRAS or MEK, associated with integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-mediated increased phosphorylation of the mTORC2 component Rictor, and AKT. Although inhibition of mTORC1/2 results in a compensatory increase in ERK phosphorylation, combinatorial treatment of PDAC cells with either KRAS (G12C) or MEK inhibitors, together with mTORC1/2 inhibitors, results in synergistic cytotoxicity and cell death reflected by inhibition of pERK and pRictor/pAKT and of downstream regulators of protein synthesis and cell survival. Relative to single agents alone, this combination leads to durable inhibition of tumor growth and metastatic progression in vivo and increased survival. We have identified an effective combinatorial treatment strategy using clinically viable inhibitors, which can be applied to PDAC tumors with different KRAS mutations.

Abstract: Leptin, an adipocyte-derived satiety hormone, has been previously linked to cardioprotection. We have shown before that leptin conferred resistance to ischemic damage in the heart in long-lived transgenic αMUPA mice overexpressing leptin compared to the wild type (WT) FVB/N control mice. To better understand the contribution of leptin to the ischemic heart, we measured here the expression of genes encoding leptin and ischemia-related proteins in αMUPA and WT mice in the heart vs adipose tissue after MI. In addition, we investigated gene expression in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes under hypoxia in the absence and presence of exogenously added leptin or a leptin antagonist. We used real time RT-PCR and ELISA or Western blot assays to measure, respectively, mRNA and protein levels. The results have shown that circulating leptin levels and mRNA levels of leptin and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the heart were elevated in both mouse genotypes after 24 h myocardial infarction (MI), reaching higher values in αMUPA mice. In contrast, leptin gene expression in the adipose tissue was significantly increased only in WT mice, but reaching lower levels compared to the heart. Expression of the proinflammatory genes encoding TNFα and IL-1β was also largely increased after MI in the heart in both mouse types, however reaching considerably lower levels in αMUPA mice indicating a mitigated inflammatory state. In cardiomyocytes, mRNA levels of all aforementioned genes as well as HIF-1α and SOD2 genes were elevated after hypoxia. Pretreatment with exogenous leptin largely reduced the mRNA levels of TNFα and IL-1β after hypoxia, while enhancing expression of all other genes and reducing ROS levels. Pretreating the cells with a leptin antagonist increased solely the levels of leptin mRNA, suggesting a negative regulation of the hormone on the expression of its own gene. Overall, the results have shown that leptin affects expression of genes in cardiomyocytes under hypoxia in a manner that could mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress, suggesting a similar influence by endogenous leptin in αMUPA mice. Furthermore, leptin is likely to function in the ischemic murine heart more effectively in an autocrine compared to paracrine manner. These results suggest that leptin can reduce ischemic damage by modulating gene expression in the heart.

Abstract: Summary
Although obesity is known to be critical for cancer development, how obesity negatively impacts antitumor immune responses remains largely unknown. Here, we show that increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) driven by activated STAT3 in CD8+ T effector cells is critical for obesity-associated breast tumor progression. Ablating T cell Stat3 or treatment with an FAO inhibitor in obese mice spontaneously developing breast tumor reduces FAO, increases glycolysis and CD8+ T effector cell functions, leading to inhibition of breast tumor development. Moreover, PD-1 ligation in CD8+ T cells activates STAT3 to increase FAO, inhibiting CD8+ T effector cell glycolysis and functions. Finally, leptin enriched in mammary adipocytes and fat tissues downregulates CD8+ T cell effector functions through activating STAT3-FAO and inhibiting glycolysis. We identify a critical role of increased oxidation of fatty acids driven by leptin and PD-1 through STAT3 in inhibiting CD8+ T effector cell glycolysis and in promoting obesity-associated breast tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages form a major cell population in the tumor microenvironment. They can be activated and polarized into tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) by the tumor-derived soluble molecules to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Here, we used comparative metabolomics coupled with biochemical and animal studies to show that cancer cells release succinate into their microenvironment and activate succinate receptor (SUCNR1) signaling to polarize macrophages into TAM. Furthermore, the results from in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that succinate promotes not only cancer cell migration and invasion but also cancer metastasis. These effects are mediated by SUCNR1-triggered PI3K-hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) axis. Compared with healthy subjects and tumor-free lung tissues, serum succinate levels and lung cancer SUCNR1 expression were elevated in lung cancer patients, suggesting an important clinical relevance. Collectively, our findings indicate that the secreted tumor-derived succinate belongs to a novel class of cancer progression factors, controlling TAM polarization and promoting tumorigenic signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The role of leptin receptor (OB-R) signaling in linking pluripotency with growth and development and the consequences of dysfunctional leptin signaling on progression of metabolic disease is poorly understood. Using a global unbiased proteomics approach we report that embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying the db/db mutation exhibit metabolic abnormalities, while their reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) show altered expression of proteins involved in embryonic development. An upregulation in expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (Eif4e) and Stat3 binding to the Eif4e promoter was supported by enhanced protein synthesis in mutant iPSCs. Directed differentiation of db/db iPSCs toward the neuronal lineage showed defects. Gene editing to correct the point mutation in db/db iPSCs using CRISPR-Cas9, restored expression of neuronal markers and protein synthesis while reversing the metabolic defects. These data imply a direct role for OB-R in regulating metabolism in embryonic fibroblasts and key developmental pathways in iPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Plasma dihydroceramides are predictors of type 2 diabetes and related to metabolic dysfunctions, but the underlying mechanisms are not characterized. We compare the relationships between plasma dihydroceramides and biochemical and hepatic parameters in two cohorts of diabetic patients. Hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis are assessed by their plasma biomarkers. Plasma lipoprotein sphingolipids are studied in a sub-group of diabetic patients. Liver biopsies from subjects with suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are analyzed for sphingolipid synthesis enzyme expression. Dihydroceramides, contained in triglyceride-rich very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), are associated with steatosis and steatohepatitis. Expression of sphingolipid synthesis enzymes is correlated with histological steatosis and inflammation grades. In conclusion, association of plasma dihydroceramides with nonalcoholic fatty liver might explain their predictive character for type 2 diabetes. Our results suggest a relationship between hepatic sphingolipid metabolism and steatohepatitis and an involvement of dihydroceramides in the synthesis/secretion of triglyceride-rich VLDL, a hallmark of NAFLD and type 2 diabetes dyslipidemia.

Abstract: Summary
Progressive lung fibrosis is a major cause of mortality in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We demonstrate that immune complexes (ICs) activate human monocytes to promote lung fibroblast migration partly via osteopontin (OPN) secretion, which is amplified by autocrine monocyte colony stimulating factor (MCSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) activity. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrate that elevated OPN expression in SSc lung tissue is enriched in macrophages, partially overlapping with CCL18 expression. Serum OPN is elevated in SSc patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and prognosticates future lung function deterioration in SSc cohorts. Serum OPN levels decrease following tocilizumab (monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor) treatment, confirming the connection between IL-6 and OPN in SSc patients. Collectively, these data suggest a plausible link between autoantibodies and lung fibrosis progression, where circulating OPN serves as a systemic proxy for IC-driven profibrotic macrophage activity, highlighting its potential as a promising biomarker in SSc ILD.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed tumors among human worldwide. Angiogenesis and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment are closely associated with CRC development. Nevertheless, the mechanisms revealing CRC progression are still not fully understood. 5′-Nucleotidase domain containing 2 (NT5DC2), a member of the NT5DC family, modulates various cellular events to mediate tumor growth, and thus serves as a disgnostic biomarker. Here, we explored the potential of NT5DC2 on tumor progression in CRC. We first found that NT5DC2 expression was significantly up-regulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. CRC patients with higher NT5DC2 expression showed poor overall survival. Furthermore, CRC cell lines stably transfected with shNT5DC2 lentivirus plasmids exhibited markedly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion compared with the negative control group. Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression levels were remarkably reduced in CRC cells with NT5DC2 deletion, along with evidently reduced tube formation in the HUVECs cultured in the collected conditional medium. The expression levels of CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and its receptor CCR2 were found to be greatly down-regulated in CRC cells transfected with shNT5DC2. Moreover, NT5DC2 knockdown markedly suppressed the activation of protein kinase-B/nuclear transcription factor κB (AKT/NF-κB) signaling in CRC cells. Furthermore, we found that NT5DC2 deletion obviously reduced the TAM recruitments through suppressing CCL2/CCR2 and AKT/NF-κB signaling pathways. Intriguingly, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that VEGF reduction was necessary for shNT5DC2-inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and TAM recruitment. In vivo studies also confirmed that NT5DC2 knockdown effectively reduced the tumor growth and VEGF expression in a xonegraft mouse model with CRC. Lung metastasis of CRC cells was also hindered by NT5DC2 deletion in vivo. Collectively, our results indicated a previously unrecognized NT5DC2/VEGF/CCL2 axis involved in CRC development and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
In this study, we incorporate analyses of genome-wide sequence and structural alterations with pre- and on-therapy transcriptomic and T cell repertoire features in immunotherapy-naive melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade. Although tumor mutation burden is associated with improved treatment response, the mutation frequency in expressed genes is superior in predicting outcome. Increased T cell density in baseline tumors and dynamic changes in regression or expansion of the T cell repertoire during therapy distinguish responders from non-responders. Transcriptome analyses reveal an increased abundance of B cell subsets in tumors from responders and patterns of molecular response related to expressed mutation elimination or retention that reflect clinical outcome. High-dimensional genomic, transcriptomic, and immune repertoire data were integrated into a multi-modal predictor of response. These findings identify genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of tumors and immune cells that predict response to immune checkpoint blockade and highlight the importance of pre-existing T and B cell immunity in therapeutic outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
The proteolytic turnover of mitochondrial proteins is poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of dynamic isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to gain a global overview of mitochondrial protein turnover in yeast cells. Intriguingly, we found an exceptionally high turnover of the NADH dehydrogenase, Nde1. This homolog of the mammalian apoptosis inducing factor, AIF, forms two distinct topomers in mitochondria, one residing in the intermembrane space while the other spans the outer membrane and is exposed to the cytosol. The surface-exposed topomer triggers cell death in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli. The surface-exposed topomer is degraded by the cytosolic proteasome/Cdc48 system and the mitochondrial protease Yme1; however, it is strongly enriched in respiratory-deficient cells. Our data suggest that in addition to their role in electron transfer, mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenases such as Nde1 or AIF integrate signals from energy metabolism and cytosolic proteostasis to eliminate compromised cells from growing populations.

Abstract: Conventional cancer cell lines and animal models have been mainstays of cancer research. More recently, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and hPSC-derived organoid technologies, together with genome engineering approaches, have provided a complementary platform to model cancer progression. Here, we review the application of these technologies in cancer modeling with respect to the cell-of-origin, cancer propagation, and metastasis. We further discuss the benefits and challenges accompanying the use of hPSC models for cancer research and discuss their broad applicability in drug discovery, biomarker identification, decoding molecular mechanisms, and the deconstruction of clonal and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. In summary, hPSC-derived organoids provide powerful models to recapitulate the pathogenic states in cancer and to perform drug discovery.

Abstract: Mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) arises from several KMT2A-gene chromosomal translocations. Shb gene deficiency has been found to exhibit pleiotropic effects in different models of leukemia, and consequently, this study aimed to investigate MLL-AF9-induced leukemia in Shb deficiency. Bone marrow cells from wild type and Shb knockout (KO) mice were transduced with the MLL-AF9 gene. Shb KO MLL-AF9 cells proliferated at an increased rate, exhibited altered expression of certain cytokine genes (Kitl, Csf3, IL6, IL1b) and higher expression of cell cycle genes (Ccnd2, Ccne1). Mice receiving Shb KO MLL-AF9 cells showed longer latency without displaying any difference in rates of leukemic cell proliferation, indicating a dichotomy between the in vitro and in vivo phenotypes. The mice with Shb deficient MLL-AF9 cells had a lower content of leukemic bone marrow cells allowing elevated normal hematopoiesis, explaining the longer latency. Finally, Shb knockout GFP-positive bone marrow cells showed a higher percentage of cells expressing myeloid markers. The result suggests a role of Shb in the progression of leukemia and that the relevance of the Shb gene is context-dependent as inferred from the differences between the in vivo and in vitro responses. These findings help to obtain an increased understanding of human MLL-AF9 leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T follicular helper cells (Tfh) are key drivers of antibody development. During Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children, the activation of Tfh is restricted to the Th1 subset and not associated with antibody levels. To identify Tfh subsets that are associated with antibody development in malaria, we assess Tfh and antibodies longitudinally in human volunteers with experimental P. falciparum infection. Tfh cells activate during infection, with distinct dynamics in different Tfh subsets. Th2-Tfh cells activate early, during peak infection, while Th1-Tfh cells activate 1 week after peak infection and treatment. Th2-Tfh cell activation is associated with the functional breadth and magnitude of parasite antibodies. In contrast, Th1-Tfh activation is not associated with antibody development but instead with plasma cells, which have previously been shown to play a detrimental role in the development of long-lived immunity. Thus, our study identifies the contrasting roles of Th2 and Th1-Tfh cells during experimental P. falciparum malaria.

Abstract: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with poorest survival outcome and is prone to metastasis. TUFT1 and the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), DANCR, play vital roles in metastasis and progression of various cancers. However, the correlation between TUFT1 and DANCR in TNBC and their downstream molecular mechanisms are still undetermined. We demonstrated that upregulation of TUFT1 in TNBC was related to a worse survival in TNBC patients. The TNBC cells invasiveness was augmented by TUFT1 in a dose-dependent manner, while inhibiting TUFT1 repressed the invasiveness. Particularly, the expression of TUFT1 was positively correlated with the expression of DANCR in TNBC tissues. In addition, TUFT1 increased DANCR expression, while silencing DANCR ameliorated the invasiveness of TNBC cells induced by TUFT1. As demonstrated, TUFT1 interacted with miR-874-3p. Subsequently, qRT-PCR together with luciferase reporter further demonstrated that DANCR acted as competing endogenous (ceRNA) for miR-874-3p, thereby regulating the de-repression of SOX2 and advancing epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TNBC. The present research shows that TUFT1 promotes the malignant development in TNBC via enhancing the expression of DANCR. The upregulation of DANCR may contribute to the progression and tumor invasiveness of TNBC, considering that DANCR functions as a miR-874-3p sponge, thus modulating SOX2 positively. Collectively, the present study explored the molecular mechanism underlying TUFT1 in TNBC, raising a TUFT1-mediated therapy for the treatment of patients with TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin is an essential growth factor for the survival and self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Although it is best known as the principal hormone promoting glycolysis in somatic cells, insulin's roles in hESC energy metabolism remain unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that insulin is essential to sustain hESC mitochondrial respiration that is rapidly decreased upon insulin removal. Insulin-dependent mitochondrial respiration is stem cell specific, and mainly relies on pyruvate and glutamine, while glucose suppresses excessive oxidative phosphorylation. Pharmacologic and genetic manipulations reveal that continuous insulin signal sustains mitochondrial respiration through PI3K/AKT activation and downstream GSK3 inhibition. We further show that insulin acts through GSK3 inhibition to suppress caspase activation and rescue cell survival. This study uncovers a critical role of the AKT/GSK3 pathway in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration and cell survival, highlighting insulin as an essential factor for accurate assessment of mitochondrial respiration in hESCs.

Abstract: Summary
H2S-producing enzymes in bacteria have been shown to be closely engaged in the process of microbial survival and antibiotic resistance. However, no inhibitors have been discovered for these enzymes, e.g., 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST). In the present study, we identified several classes of inhibitors for Escherichia coli MST (eMST) through high-throughput screening of ∼26,000 compounds. The thiazolidinedione-type inhibitors were found to selectively bind to Arg178 and Ser239 residues of eMST but hardly affected human MST. Moreover, the pioglitazone of this class concentration dependently accumulates the 3-mercaptopyruvate substrate and suppresses the H2S and reactive sulfane sulfur products in bacteria. Importantly, pioglitazone could potentiate the level of reactive oxygen species in cellulo and consequently enhance the antimicrobial effects of gentamicin and macrophages in culture. This study has identified the bioactive inhibitor of eMST, paving the way for the pharmacological targeting of eMST to synergistically control the survival of E. coli.

Abstract: Although, the Red sea is highly rich with fish fauna but still the information known is so limited for the researchers especially about the fish physiology baselines. So, in the present study we investigated the heamto-biochemical parameters and cell characterization of two fish having the same feeding habitats. Fish specimens of Red Sea goatfish (Parupeneus forsskali) and Klunzinger's wrasse (Thalassoma klunzingeri) were captured from Hurghada, Egypt. Haematological and biochemical analysis as well as blood cells characterization were performed. The morphological and cytochemical aspects of peripheral blood cells of the two species were studied by light microscopy. Thalassoma klunzingeri showed lower Hct and Hb values and RBCs count. Fusiform to spindle shape thrombocytes were found only in the blood of Parupeneus forsskali while spiked thrombocytes were found only in the blood of Thalassoma klunzingeri. This investigation may be helpful as a tool to monitor the health status of the two species and will be used as biomarkers for clinical pathology.

Abstract: Structures of cellular organelles are intertwined with their functions that undergo alterations once the organelles are stressed. Since organelle functions are dependent on each other, an organelle-specific stress possibly influences the structure and function of its associated organelles. In this perspective, our study demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-specific stress induced by tunicamycin in primary astroglial culture is associated with altered mitochondrial dynamics and matched with the changes as observed in the aging rat brain. However, the exogenous addition of biotin, a highly lipogenic and mitochondrial vitamin, ameliorates ER stress even though its direct targets are not known within ER. Alternatively, the increased biotinylation of mitochondrial carboxylases preserves its basal respiratory capacity by upregulating mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and, possibly, its associated role on mitochondrial fusion. Furthermore, the Mfn2 increase by biotin augments physical interaction between ER and functional mitochondria to exchange biomolecules as a part of ER stress resolution. This suggests an increased demand for micronutrient biotin under ER stress resolves the same by undergoing appropriate structural and metabolic contacts between ER and mitochondria. These findings provide a paradigm to resolve stress in one organelle by sustaining the metabolic commitments of another interdependent organelle. The findings also highlight a novel role of biotin in inducing Mfn2 expression and localization under ER stress in addition to its known role as a co-enzyme.

Abstract: Urbanization in low-income countries represents an important inflection point in the epidemiology of disease, with rural populations experiencing high rates of chronic and recurrent infections and urban populations displaying a profile of noncommunicable diseases. To investigate if urbanization alters the expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, we queried gene microarray data from rural and urban populations living in Morocco (GSE17065). The R Bioconductor packages edgeR and limma were used to identify genes with different expression. The experimental design was modeled upon location and sex. Nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins were identified from the MitoCarta2.0 database. Of the 1158 genes listed in the MitoCarta2.0 database, 847 genes (73%) were available for analysis in the Moroccan dataset. The urban-rural comparison with the greatest environmental differences showed that 76.5% of the MitoCarta2.0 genes were differentially expressed, with 97% of the genes having an increased expression in the urban area. Enrichment analysis revealed 367 significantly enriched pathways (adjusted p value < 0.05), with oxidative phosphorylation, insulin secretion and glucose regulations (adj.p values = 6.93E-16) being the top three. Four significantly perturbed KEGG disease pathways were associated with urbanization—three degenerative neurological diseases (Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s diseases) and herpes simplex infection (false discover rate corrected p value (PGFdr) < 0.2). Mitochondrial RNA metabolic processing and translational elongation were the biological processes that had the greatest enrichment (enrichment ratios 14.0 and 14.8, respectively, FDR < 0.5). Our study links urbanization in Morocco with changes in the expression of the nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins.

Abstract: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) is a DNA damage sensor that gets activated in proportion to the damage, helping cells to determine whether to repair the damage or initiate cell death processes. We have previously shown PARP1's significance in the developmental processes of Dictyostelium discoideum in addition to its role in oxidative stress and UV-C stress induced cell death. In this study, we show the significance of ROS in PARP1 mediated responses of D. discoideum under different stress conditions. Interestingly, our results suggest differential kinetics of PARP1 activation and implications of ROS in starvation and cadmium induced cell death events. Increased accumulation of Poly (ADP-ribose), a product of PARP activation, could be detected within minutes post cadmium stress, whereas PARP1 activation was only a later event with starvation. Starvation induced PARP1 activation was supported by the depletion of ATP and NAD+, while PARP inhibitor confers protective effect during starvation. During starvation, cell death is induced in two phases, a primary ROS driven PARP1 independent early necrotic phase followed by a PARP1 driven ROS dependent paraptotic phase; both of which comprise mitochondrial changes. Cadmium (Cd) exerted a dose-dependent effect on cell death; a low dose of 0.2 mM Cd led to paraptosis and a higher dose of 0.5 mM Cd led to necrosis in D. discoideum cells within 24 h. Interestingly, glutathione (GSH) exposure could rescue cells from Cd stress mediated cell death. Besides unicellular cell death, the developmental arrest induced by cadmium and oxidative stress could be rescued by reinstating the redox equilibrium using GSH. In conclusion, we underscore the significant link between PARP1 and ROS in regulating the process of cell death and development in D. discoideum.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation and histone H1 mediate transcriptional silencing of genes and transposable elements, but how they interact is unclear. In plants and animals with mosaic genomic methylation, functionally mysterious methylation is also common within constitutively active housekeeping genes. Here, we show that H1 is enriched in methylated sequences, including genes, of Arabidopsis thaliana, yet this enrichment is independent of DNA methylation. Loss of H1 disperses heterochromatin, globally alters nucleosome organization, and activates H1-bound genes, but only weakly de-represses transposable elements. However, H1 loss strongly activates transposable elements hypomethylated through mutation of DNA methyltransferase MET1. Hypomethylation of genes also activates antisense transcription, which is modestly enhanced by H1 loss. Our results demonstrate that H1 and DNA methylation jointly maintain transcriptional homeostasis by silencing transposable elements and aberrant intragenic transcripts. Such functionality plausibly explains why DNA methylation, a well-known mutagen, has been maintained within coding sequences of crucial plant and animal genes.

Abstract: Neural crest cells are an embryonic multipotent stem cell population. Recent studies in model organisms have suggested that neural crest cells are specified earlier than previously thought, at blastula stages. However, the molecular dynamics of early neural crest specification, and functional changes from pluripotent precursors to early specified NC, remain to be elucidated. In this report, we utilized a robust human model of cranial neural crest formation to address the distinct molecular character of the earliest stages of neural crest specification and assess the functional differences from its embryonic stem cell precursor. Our human neural crest model reveals a rapid change in the epigenetic state of neural crest and pluripotency genes, accompanied by changes in gene expression upon Wnt-based induction from embryonic stem cells. These changes in gene expression are directly regulated by the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Furthermore, prospective cranial neural crest cells are characterized by restricted stem cell potential compared to embryonic stem cells. Our results suggest that human neural crest induced by Wnt/β-catenin signaling from human embryonic stem cells rapidly acquire a prospective neural crest cell state defined by a unique molecular signature and endowed with limited potential compared to pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is a member of TGF-β superfamily. Among hematopoietic cells, this factor is mainly produced by erythroid series and is recently considered a biomarker of ineffective erythropoiesis (IE). Whether IE induces enhanced GDF-15 expression or is prompted by it, has remained elusive. In this study we investigated how high levels of GDF-15 contribute to IE-associated erythroid dysplasia. We assessed mRNA levels of GDF-15 during erythroid maturation as well as in patients with IE using qRT-PCR. Later, the erythroid colony-forming capacity of GDF-15-treated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) was evaluated by CFC assay. Any effect of elevated levels of GDF-15 on erythroid maturation was ultimately examined by expression analysis of erythroid-associated transcription factors and flow cytometry analysis of CD235a expression. GDF-15 mRNA expression increased during erythroid differentiation and also in β-thalassemia and MDS patients which was directly correlated with erythropoiesis severity. Treating the cells with high GDF-15 concentration (50 ng/ml) resulted in an approximate 30% decline in the capacity of erythroid colony formation of HSCs and CD235a positive cells. Additionally, erythroid-specific transcription factors showed significant down-regulation in the early stages of erythroid differentiation. According to the expression level of GDF-15 and the role it plays in the erythroid system, high-levels of this factor could be an auto-modulatory mechanism to control the excessive production of erythroid cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mode of delivery strongly influences the early infant gut microbiome. Children born by cesarean section (C-section) lack Bacteroides species until 6–18 months of age. One hypothesis is that these differences stem from lack of exposure to the maternal vaginal microbiome. Here, we re-evaluate this hypothesis by comparing the microbial profiles of 75 infants born vaginally or by planned versus emergent C-section. Multiple children born by C-section have a high abundance of Bacteroides in their first few days of life, but at 2 weeks, both C-section groups lack Bacteroides (primarily according to 16S sequencing), despite their difference in exposure to the birth canal. Finally, a comparison of microbial strain profiles between infants and maternal vaginal or rectal samples finds evidence for mother-to-child transmission of rectal rather than vaginal strains. These results suggest differences in colonization stability as an important factor in infant gut microbiome composition rather than birth canal exposure.

Abstract: Prenatal glucocorticoid overexposure could largely influence pituitary-adrenal activity and anxiety-like behavior in offspring. Our aim was to study the possible potentiating effect of moderate dose of fructose – common ingredient of today’s diet – on prenatal glucocorticoid treatment-induced hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis changes. Pregnant female rats were treated with multiple dexamethasone (Dx) doses (3 x 0.5 mg/kg/b.m. Dx; 16th-18th gestational day). Half of female offspring from control and Dx treated dams were supplemented with 10% fructose solution, from weaning till adulthood. Immunohistochemistry, unbiased stereological evaluation and hormonal analysis are used to provide the morpho-functional state of pituitary and adrenal gland. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed using the light/dark box test and the elevated plus maze test. Prenatally Dx exposed females, with or without fructose consumption, had markedly reduced adrenocortical volume (p < 0.05) comparing to controls. Increased basal plasma ACTH level in these females (p < 0.05) maintained corticosterone concentration at control level produced by smaller adrenal glands. In parallel, anxiety-like behavior was shown by both tests used. In conclusion, prenatal Dx exposure cause negative psychophysiological outcome reflected in increased HPA axis activity and anxiety behavior in female offspring, while moderately increased fructose consumption failed to evoke any alteration or to potentiate effects of prenatal Dx exposure.

Abstract: Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces a series of endogenous biochemical changes that lead to secondary degeneration, including apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effect and mechanism of action of MGMT in strengthing neuronal apoptosis following SCI. To determine MGMT-mediated apoptosis in spinal cord injury, we performed western blot and analyzed the expression change of MGMT with different timepoints. Western blot analysis showed the upregulation of MGMT has a peak at 21 days in injured spinal cord tissues. Expression and location was observed in the neurons after SCI. Upregulation of p53, Bax, cleaved caspase3 and cleaved caspase9 and downregulation of Bcl2 were detected after SCI. Co-localization of cleaved caspase3 with MGMT indicated MGMT involved in apoptosis taking place after SCI. In addition, we carried out H2O2 stimulation to further confirm MGMT played a role in neuron apoptosis process and activated p53 signaling pathway in vitro. Finally, based above data, we packaged lenti-associated virus inhibit MGMT expression and injected into rat spinal cords after SCI model was built. LV-MGMT not only reduces the neuron apoptosis, but also increases GAP43 expression and promotes hindlimbs locomotor function recovery. Taken together, the in vivo data and the in vitro observations prove MGMT-mediated apoptosis in the injured spinal cord.

Abstract: Summary
R loops arising during transcription induce genomic instability, but how cells respond to the R loop-associated genomic stress is still poorly understood. Here, we show that cells harboring high levels of R loops rely on the ATR kinase for survival. In response to aberrant R loop accumulation, the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)-Chk1 pathway is activated by R loop-induced reversed replication forks. In contrast to the activation of ATR by replication inhibitors, R loop-induced ATR activation requires the MUS81 endonuclease. ATR protects the genome from R loops by suppressing transcription-replication collisions, promoting replication fork recovery, and enforcing a G2/M cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, ATR prevents excessive cleavage of reversed forks by MUS81, revealing a MUS81-triggered and ATR-mediated feedback loop that fine-tunes MUS81 activity at replication forks. These results suggest that ATR is a key sensor and suppressor of R loop-induced genomic instability, uncovering a signaling circuitry that safeguards the genome against R loops.

Abstract: Summary
The acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system plays an important role in bacterial and viral infections. Here, we report that either pharmacological inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase with amitriptyline, imipramine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, or maprotiline or genetic downregulation of the enzyme prevents infection of cultured cells or freshy isolated human nasal epithelial cells with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoviral particles (pp-VSV) presenting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike), a bona fide system mimicking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection activates acid sphingomyelinase and triggers a release of ceramide on the cell surface. Neutralization or consumption of surface ceramide reduces infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Treating volunteers with a low dose of amitriptyline prevents infection of freshly isolated nasal epithelial cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. The data justify clinical studies investigating whether amitriptyline, a safe drug used clinically for almost 60 years, or other antidepressants that functionally block acid sphingomyelinase prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: F-box and WD domain protein 7 (FBXW7) is reported to bind with c-Myc in mouse spermatogonial stem cells, regulating self-renewal; however, the pattern and stage of expression of FBXW7 in human testes are unclear. In the present study, we examined the expression of human FBXW7 in adult testis, and analyzed fixed sections from adult testes and fetal testes to determine the cell type-specific expression pattern of FBXW7. The results showed that FBXW7α and FBXW7β genes are expressed in the testis; however, only FBXW7α protein could be detected. FBXW7 was not detected in human spermatogonial stem cells. Interestingly, FBXW7 was mainly expressed in the cell nuclei of later stage germ cells and differentiated somatic cells. We also observed high FBXW7 expression in human fetal germ cells, particularly in prespermatogonia. Our results raised the possibility that FBXW7 has different functions in humans and mice. The cell type-specific expression pattern of FBXW7 suggests that it performs regulatory functions during the late stage of human spermatogenesis instead of being involved in the self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebral organoids (COs) are rapidly accelerating the rate of translational neuroscience based on their potential to model complex features of the developing human brain. Several studies have examined the electrophysiological and neural network features of COs; however, no study has comprehensively investigated the developmental trajectory of electrophysiological properties in whole-brain COs and correlated these properties with developmentally linked morphological and cellular features. Here, we profiled the neuroelectrical activities of COs over the span of 5 months with a multi-electrode array platform and observed the emergence and maturation of several electrophysiologic properties, including rapid firing rates and network bursting events. To complement these analyses, we characterized the complex molecular and cellular development that gives rise to these mature neuroelectrical properties with immunohistochemical and single-cell transcriptomic analyses. This integrated approach highlights the value of COs as an emerging model system of human brain development and neurological disease.

Abstract: The 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70s) are a conserved class of chaperones that play critical roles during the normal life cycle of plants. HSP70s are particularly involved in the regulation of biotic and abiotic stress responses. In this paper, the potential roles of this protein were investigated. A reverse genetic approach was employed for transient silencing of hsp70 gene in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) to evaluate different growth and physiological parameters under normal conditions and during the response to drought stress. A combined ANOVA (analysis of variance) and HCA (hierarchical clustering analysis) showed that hsp70 silencing led to severe growth retardation and mortality, significant membrane damage and leakage, decline in relative water content, low rate of pigment accumulation, and reduced antioxidant enzyme activity under normal and drought stress conditions. Among the different parameters, proline was the only trait that was unaffected by gene silencing and accumulated by similar amounts to that of nonsilent plants. In conclusion, HSP70 played critical roles in maintaining the cellular homeostasis of plants during adaptation to drought and under normal plant life conditions. It was speculated that proline was, to some extent, involved in improving the loss of protein folding or function resulting from HSP70 deficiency, and played a crucial role in the adaptation of plants on exposure to stress.

Abstract: Summary
Hydroxychloroquine is being investigated for a potential prophylactic effect in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Circulating leukocytes from the blood of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients show increased responses to Toll-like receptor ligands, suggestive of trained immunity. By analyzing interferon responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors conditioned with heat-killed Candida, trained innate immunity can be modeled in vitro. In this model, hydroxychloroquine inhibits the responsiveness of these innate immune cells to virus-like stimuli and interferons. This is associated with a suppression of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation of inflammation-related genes, changes in the cellular lipidome, and decreased expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Our findings indicate that hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity in vitro, which may not be beneficial for the antiviral innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients.

Abstract: Summary
Lymphocytes in barrier tissues play critical roles in host defense and homeostasis. These cells take up residence in tissues during defined developmental windows, when they may demonstrate distinct phenotypes and functions. Here, we utilized mass and flow cytometry to elucidate early features of human skin immunity. Although most conventional αβ T (Tconv) cells in fetal skin have a naive, proliferative phenotype, a subset of CD4+ Tconv and CD8+ cells demonstrate memory-like features and a propensity for interferon (IFN)γ production. Skin regulatory T cells dynamically accumulate over the second trimester in temporal and regional association with hair follicle development. These fetal skin regulatory T cells (Tregs) demonstrate an effector memory phenotype while differing from their adult counterparts in expression of key effector molecules. Thus, we identify features of prenatal skin lymphocytes that may have key implications for understanding antigen and allergen encounters in utero and in infancy.

Abstract: In animal models with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the status epilepticus (SE) leads to a dramatic increase in number of newly born neuron in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of dentate gyrus. How the SE confers a modulation in the dentate neurogenesis is mostly unknown. Gadd45b is involved in epigenetic gene activation by DNA demethylation. This study was performed to present a novel mechanism underling SE-induced dentate neurogenesis. A transient induction (12 hrs to 3 days) of Gadd45b was observed in dentate gyrus of mice after pilocarpine-induced SE. Labeling the dividing cells with BrdU, we next found that the induction of Gadd45b was required to increase the rate of cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus at 7 and 14 days after SE. Afterward, the DNA methylation levels for candidate growth factor genes critical for the adult neurogenesis were assayed with Sequenom MassARRAY Analyzer. The results indicated that Gadd45b was necessary for SE-induced DNA demethylation of specific promoters and expression of corresponding genes in the dentate gyrus, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Using Timm staining, we further suggested that SE-induced Gadd45b might contribute to the subsequent mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in the chronically epileptic hippocampus via epigenetic regulation of dentate neurogenesis at early stage after SE. Together, Gadd45b links pilocarpine-induced SE to epigenetic DNA modification of secreted factors in the dentate gyrus, leading to extrinsic modulation on the neurogenesis.

Abstract: Constant neuroregeneration in adult olfactory epithelium maintains olfactory function by basal stem cell proliferation and differentiation to replace lost olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Understanding the mechanisms regulating this process could reveal potential therapeutic targets for stimulating adult olfactory neurogenesis under pathological conditions and aging. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in astrocytes promotes forebrain neurogenesis but its function in the olfactory system is unknown. Here, we show in mouse olfactory epithelium that CNTF is expressed in horizontal basal cells, olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) and a small subpopulation of OSNs. CNTF receptor alpha was expressed in Mash1-positive globose basal cells (GBCs) and OECs. Thus, CNTF may affect GBCs in a paracrine manner. CNTF−/− mice did not display altered GBC proliferation or olfactory function, suggesting that CNTF is not involved in basal olfactory renewal or that they developed compensatory mechanisms. Therefore, we tested the effect of increased CNTF in wild type mice. Intranasal instillation of a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor, FAK14, upregulated CNTF expression. FAK14 also promoted GBC proliferation, neuronal differentiation and basal stem cell self-renewal but had no effective in CNTF−/− mice, suggesting that FAK inhibition promotes olfactory neuroregeneration through CNTF, making them potential targets to treat sensorineural anosmia due to OSN loss.

Abstract: Ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (USP4), has been reported to participate in the progression of various cancers due to its role in post-translational modulation. However, the prognostic significance and mechanism of USP4 in pancreatic cancer (PC) have not been well elucidated before. In the present study, we found that USP4 expression was higher in PC tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues and PC patients with high level of USP4 expression have a poor prognosis via immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics analyses. In vitro study showed that knockdown of USP4 inhibited PC cells proliferation, migration and invasion. Mechanistically, USP4 can activate nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway via stabilizing TNF receptor associated factor 6 at its protein level to promote the ability of proliferation, migration and invasion of PC cells. The results of this study revealed that USP4 plays a tumor-promoting role in PC and can be used as a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for patients with resected PC.

Abstract: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive response that is implicated in multiple metabolic pathologies, including hepatic steatosis. In the present study, we analyzed publicly available RNAseq data to explore how the execution of the UPR is orchestrated in specimens that exhibit hepatocyte ballooning, a landmark feature of steatosis. By focusing on a panel of well-established UPR genes, we assessed how the UPR is coordinated with the whole transcriptome in specimens with or without hepatocyte ballooning. Our analyses showed that neither average levels nor correlation in expression between major UPR genes such as HSPA5 (BiP/GRP78), HSP90b1 (GRP94), or DDIT3 (CHOP) is altered in different groups. However, a panel of transcripts depending on the stringency of the analysis ranged from 16 to 372 lost its coordination with HSPA5, the major UPR chaperone, when hepatocyte ballooning occurred. In 13 genes, the majority of which is associated with metabolic processes, and the coordination with the HSPA5 was reversed from positive to negative in livers with ballooning hepatocytes. In order to examine if during ballooning, UPR genes abolish established and acquire novel functionalities, we performed gene ontology analyses. These studies showed that among the various UPR genes interrogated, only DDIT3 was not associated with conventional functions linked to endoplasmic reticulum stress during ballooning, while HSPA90b1 exhibited the highest function retention between the specimens with or without ballooning. Our results challenge conventional notions on the impact of specific genes in disease and suggest that besides abundance, the mode of coordination of UPR may be more important for disease development.

Abstract: The mechanical properties of erythrocytes have been investigated by different techniques. However, there are few reports on how the viscoelasticity of these cells varies during malaria disease. Here, we quantitatively map the viscoelastic properties of Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized human erythrocytes. We apply new methodologies based on optical tweezers to measure the viscoelastic properties and defocusing microscopy to measure the erythrocyte height profile, the overall cell volume, and its form factor, a crucial parameter to convert the complex elastic constant into complex shear modulus. The storage and loss shear moduli are obtained for each stage of parasite maturation inside red blood cells, while the former increase, the latter decrease. Employing a soft glassy rheology model, we obtain the power-law exponent for the storage and loss shear moduli, characterizing the soft glassy features of red blood cells in each parasite maturation stage. Ring forms present a liquid-like behavior, with a slightly lower power-law exponent than healthy erythrocytes, whereas trophozoite and schizont stages exhibit increasingly solid-like behaviors. Finally, the surface elastic shear moduli, low-frequency surface viscosities, and shape recovery relaxation times all increase not only in a stage-dependent manner but also when compared to healthy red blood cells. Overall, the results call attention to the soft glassy characteristics of Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized erythrocyte membrane and may provide a basis for future studies to better understand malaria disease from a mechanobiological perspective.

Abstract: Summary
While obesity and associated metabolic complications are linked to inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT), the causal factors remain unclear. We hypothesized that the local metabolic environment could be an important determinant. To this end, we compared metabolites released from WAT of 81 obese and non-obese women. This identified glutamine to be downregulated in obesity and inversely associated with a pernicious WAT phenotype. Glutamine administration in vitro and in vivo attenuated both pro-inflammatory gene and protein levels in adipocytes and WAT and macrophage infiltration in WAT. Metabolomic and bioenergetic analyses in human adipocytes suggested that glutamine attenuated glycolysis and reduced uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) levels. UDP-GlcNAc is the substrate for the post-translational modification O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) mediated by the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase. Functional studies in human adipocytes established a mechanistic link between reduced glutamine, O-GlcNAcylation of nuclear proteins, and a pro-inflammatory transcriptional response. Altogether, glutamine metabolism is linked to WAT inflammation in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
In animal models, time-restricted feeding (TRF) can prevent and reverse aspects of metabolic diseases. Time-restricted eating (TRE) in human pilot studies reduces the risks of metabolic diseases in otherwise healthy individuals. However, patients with diagnosed metabolic syndrome often undergo pharmacotherapy, and it has never been tested whether TRE can act synergistically with pharmacotherapy in animal models or humans. In a single-arm, paired-sample trial, 19 participants with metabolic syndrome and a baseline mean daily eating window of ≥14 h, the majority of whom were on a statin and/or antihypertensive therapy, underwent 10 h of TRE (all dietary intake within a consistent self-selected 10 h window) for 12 weeks. We found this TRE intervention improves cardiometabolic health for patients with metabolic syndrome receiving standard medical care including high rates of statin and anti-hypertensive use. TRE is a potentially powerful lifestyle intervention that can be added to standard medical practice to treat metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: In their role as molecular chaperones, heat shock proteins (Hsps) mediate protein folding thereby mitigating cellular damage caused by physiological and environmental stress. Nauplii of the crustacean Artemia franciscana respond to heat shock by producing Hsps; however, the effects of cold shock on Hsp levels in A. franciscana have not been investigated previously. The effect of cold shock at 1°C followed by recovery at 27°C on the amounts of ArHsp90, Hsp70, ArHsp40, and ArHsp40-2 mRNA and their respective proteins in A. franciscana nauplii was examined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunoprobing of western blots. The same Hsp mRNAs and proteins were also quantified during incubation of nauplii at their optimal growth temperature of 27 °C. qPCR analyses indicated that the abundance of ArHsp90, Hsp70, and ArHsp40 mRNA remained relatively constant during both cold shock and recovery and was not significantly different compared with levels at optimal temperature. Western blotting revealed that ArHsp90, ArHsp40, and ArHsp40-2 were generally below baseline, but at detectable levels during the 6 h of cold shock, and persisted in early recovery stages before declining. Hsp70 was the only protein that remained constant in quantity throughout cold shock and recovery. By contrast, all Hsps declined rapidly during 6 h when nauplii were incubated continuously at 27°C optimal temperature. Generally, the amounts of ArHsp90, ArHsp40, and ArHsp40-2 were higher during cold shock/recovery than those during continuous incubation at 27 °C. Our data support the conclusion that low temperature preserves Hsp levels, making them available to assist in protein repair and recovery after cold shock.

Abstract: Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), the non-selective cation channel, was found that can mediate the generation of multiple sclerosis, while the mechanism is still controversial. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is a critical trigger of multiple sclerosis which results from the syndrome of neuronal inflammation and demyelination. In this work, we suggested that TRPA1 can mediate the LPC-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in OLN-93 oligodendrocyte. The expression of TRPA1 in OLN-93 was detected by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence. The calcium overload induced by LPC via TRPA1 was detected by calcium imaging. The mechanism of LPC-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) generation, mitochondria membrane depolarization, nitric oxide (NO) increase, and development of superoxide production via TRPA1 was verified by using confocal imaging. The cell injury elicited by LPC via TRPA1 was confirmed by both CCK-8 and LDH cytotoxicity detection. These results indicate that TRPA1 plays an important role of the LPC-induced oxidative stress and cell damage in OLN-93 oligodendrocyte. Therefore, inhibition of TRPA1 may protect the LPC-induced demyelination.

Abstract: Summary
The multifunctional histone chaperone, SET, is essential for embryonic development in the mouse. Previously, we identified SET as a factor that is rapidly downregulated during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation, suggesting a possible role in the maintenance of pluripotency. Here, we explore SET's function in early differentiation. Using immunoprecipitation coupled with protein quantitation by LC-MS/MS, we uncover factors and complexes, including P53 and β-catenin, by which SET regulates lineage specification. Knockdown for P53 in SET-knockout (KO) ESCs partially rescues lineage marker misregulation during differentiation. Paradoxically, SET-KO ESCs show increased expression of several Wnt target genes despite reduced levels of active β-catenin. Further analysis of RNA sequencing datasets hints at a co-regulatory relationship between SET and TCF proteins, terminal effectors of Wnt signaling. Overall, we discover a role for both P53 and β-catenin in SET-regulated early differentiation and raise a hypothesis for SET function at the β-catenin-TCF regulatory axis.

Abstract: Summary
In 2014, an outbreak of avian A/H10N7 influenza virus occurred among seals along North-European coastal waters, significantly impacting seal populations. Here, we examine the cross-species transmission and mammalian adaptation of this influenza A virus, revealing changes in the hemagglutinin surface protein that increase stability and receptor binding. The seal A/H10N7 virus was aerosol or respiratory droplet transmissible between ferrets. Compared with avian H10 hemagglutinin, seal H10 hemagglutinin showed stronger binding to the human-type sialic acid receptor, with preferential binding to α2,6-linked sialic acids on long extended branches. In X-ray structures, changes in the 220-loop of the receptor-binding pocket caused similar interactions with human receptor as seen for pandemic strains. Two substitutions made seal H10 hemagglutinin more stable than avian H10 hemagglutinin and similar to human hemagglutinin. Consequently, identification of avian-origin influenza viruses across mammals appears critical to detect influenza A viruses posing a major threat to humans and other mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Direct reprogramming has been widely explored to generate various types of neurons for neurobiological research and translational medicine applications, but there is still no efficient reprogramming method to generate retinal ganglion cell (RGC)-like neurons, which are the sole projection neurons in the retina. Here, we show that three transcription factors, Ascl1, Brn3b, and Isl1, efficiently convert fibroblasts into RGC-like neurons (iRGCs). Furthermore, we show that the competence of cells to enter iRGC reprogramming route is determined by the cell-cycle status at a very early stage of the process. The iRGC reprogramming route involves intermediate states that are characterized by a transient inflammatory-like response followed by active epigenomic and transcriptional modifications. Our study provides an efficient method to generate iRGCs, which would be a valuable cell source for potential glaucoma cell replacement therapy and drug screening studies, and reveals the key cellular events that govern successful neuronal fate reprogramming.

Abstract: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have important roles in transcription, pre-mRNA processing/transport, mRNA degradation, translation, and non-coding RNA processing, among others. RBPs that are expressed in response to cold stress, such as Cirp and Rbm3, could regulate RNA stability and translation in hibernating mammals that reduce their body temperatures from 37°C to as low as 0–5°C during torpor bouts. RBPs including Cirp, Rbm3, and stress-inducible HuR translocate from the nucleus to stabilize mRNAs in the cytoplasm, and thereby could regulate which mRNA transcripts are protected from degradation and are translated, versus stored, for future protein synthesis or degraded by nucleases during cell stress associated with metabolic rate depression. This is the first study to explore the transcriptional/translational regulation, and subcellular localization of cold-inducible RBPs in a model hibernator, the 13-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). Cirp protein levels were upregulated in liver, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue throughout the torpor-arousal cycle whereas Rbm3 protein levels stayed constant or decreased, suggesting an important role for Cirp, but likely not Rbm3, in the hibernator stress response. Increased cytoplasmic localization of Cirp in liver and muscle and HuR in liver during torpor, but no changes in the relative levels of Rbm3 in the cytoplasm, emphasizes a role for Cirp and possibly HuR in regulating mRNA processing during torpor. This study informs our understanding of the natural adaptations that extreme animals use in the face of stress, and highlight natural stress response mediators that could be used to bolster cryoprotection of human organs donated for transplant.

Abstract: Summary
Currently an in vitro model that fully recapitulates the human embryonic gonad is lacking. Here we describe a fully defined feeder-free protocol to generate early testis-like cells with the ability to be cultured as an organoid, from human induced pluripotent stem cells. This stepwise approach uses small molecules to mimic embryonic development, with upregulation of bipotential gonad markers (LHX9, EMX2, GATA4, and WT1) at day 10 of culture, followed by induction of testis Sertoli cell markers (SOX9, WT1, and AMH) by day 15. Aggregation into 3D structures and extended culture on Transwell filters yielded organoids with defined tissue structures and distinct Sertoli cell marker expression. These studies provide insight into human gonadal development, suggesting that a population of precursor cells may originate from a more lateral region of the mesoderm. Our protocol represents a significant advance toward generating a much-needed human gonad organoid for studying disorders/differences of sex development.

Abstract: Summary
Geographically dispersed patients, inconsistent treatment tracking, and limited infrastructure slow research for many orphan diseases. We assess the feasibility of a patient-powered study design to overcome these challenges for Castleman disease, a rare hematologic disorder. Here, we report initial results from the ACCELERATE natural history registry. ACCELERATE includes a traditional physician-reported arm and a patient-powered arm, which enables patients to directly contribute medical data and biospecimens. This study design enables successful enrollment, with the 5-year minimum enrollment goal being met in 2 years. A median of 683 clinical, laboratory, and imaging data elements are captured per patient in the patient-powered arm compared with 37 in the physician-reported arm. These data reveal subgrouping characteristics, identify off-label treatments, support treatment guidelines, and are used in 17 clinical and translational studies. This feasibility study demonstrates that the direct-to-patient design is effective for collecting natural history data and biospecimens, tracking therapies, and providing critical research infrastructure.

Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is an endoplasmic reticulum calcium sensing protein important for SOCE. We generated a mouse model expressing the STIM1 R304W mutation, causing Stormorken syndrome in humans. Stim1R304W/R304W mice showed perinatal lethality, and the only three animals that survived into adulthood presented with reduced growth, low body weight, and thoracic kyphosis. Radiographs revealed a reduced number of ribs in the Stim1R304W/R304W mice. Microcomputed tomography data revealed decreased cortical bone thickness and increased trabecular bone volume fraction in Stim1R304W/R304W mice, which had thinner and more compact bone compared to wild type mice. The Stim1R304W/+ mice showed an intermediate phenotype. Histological analyses showed that the Stim1R304W/R304W mice had abnormal bone architecture, with markedly increased number of trabeculae and reduced bone marrow cavity. Homozygous mice showed STIM1 positive osteocytes and osteoblasts. These findings highlight the critical role of the gain-of-function (GoF) STIM1 R304W protein in skeletal development and homeostasis in mice. Furthermore, the novel feature of bilateral subgingival hair growth on the lower incisors in the Stim1R304W/R304W mice and 25 % of the heterozygous mice indicate that the GoF STIM1 R304W protein also induces an abnormal epithelial cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Phagocytosis is a key function in various cells throughout the body. A deficiency in photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) causes vision loss in inherited retinal diseases and possibly age-related macular degeneration. To date, there are no effective therapies available aiming at recovering the lost phagocytosis function. Here, we developed a high-throughput screening assay based on RPE derived from human embryonic stem cells (hRPE) to reveal enhancers of POS phagocytosis. One of the hits, ramoplanin (RM), reproducibly enhanced POS phagocytosis and ensheathment in hRPE, and enhanced the expression of proteins known to regulate membrane dynamics and ensheathment in other cell systems. Additionally, RM rescued POS internalization defect in Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK) mutant hRPE, derived from retinitis pigmentosa patient induced pluripotent stem cells. Our platform, including a primary phenotypic screening phagocytosis assay together with orthogonal assays, establishes a basis for RPE-based therapy discovery aiming at a broad patient spectrum.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in CAPN3 cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy R1 (LGMDR1, formerly LGMD2A) and lead to progressive and debilitating muscle wasting. Calpain 3 deficiency is associated with impaired CaMKIIβ signaling and blunted transcriptional programs that encode the slow-oxidative muscle phenotype. We conducted a high-throughput screen on a target of CaMKII (Myl2) to identify compounds to override this signaling defect; 4 were tested in vivo in the Capn3 knockout (C3KO) model of LGMDR1. The leading compound, AMBMP, showed good exposure and was able to reverse the LGMDR1 phenotype in vivo, including improved oxidative properties, increased slow fiber size, and enhanced exercise performance. AMBMP also activated CaMKIIβ signaling, but it did not alter other pathways known to be associated with muscle growth. Thus, AMBMP treatment activates CaMKII and metabolically reprograms skeletal muscle toward a slow muscle phenotype. These proof-of-concept studies lend support for an approach to the development of therapeutics for LGMDR1.

Abstract: Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 spike employs mobile receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to engage the human ACE2 receptor and to facilitate virus entry, which can occur through low-pH-endosomal pathways. To understand how ACE2 binding and low pH affect spike conformation, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures—at serological and endosomal pH—delineating spike recognition of up to three ACE2 molecules. RBDs freely adopted “up” conformations required for ACE2 interaction, primarily through RBD movement combined with smaller alterations in neighboring domains. In the absence of ACE2, single-RBD-up conformations dominated at pH 5.5, resolving into a solitary all-down conformation at lower pH. Notably, a pH-dependent refolding region (residues 824–858) at the spike-interdomain interface displayed dramatic structural rearrangements and mediated RBD positioning through coordinated movements of the entire trimer apex. These structures provide a foundation for understanding prefusion-spike mechanics governing endosomal entry; we suggest that the low pH all-down conformation potentially facilitates immune evasion from RBD-up binding antibody.

Abstract: Summary
Theory and experiments suggest that organisms would benefit from pre-adaptation to future stressors based on reproducible environmental fluctuations experienced by their ancestors, but the mechanisms driving pre-adaptation remain enigmatic. We report that the [SMAUG+] prion allows yeast to anticipate nutrient repletion after periods of starvation, providing a strong selective advantage. By transforming the landscape of post-transcriptional gene expression, [SMAUG+] regulates the decision between two broad growth and survival strategies: mitotic proliferation or meiotic differentiation into a stress-resistant state. [SMAUG+] is common in laboratory yeast strains, where standard propagation practice produces regular cycles of nutrient scarcity followed by repletion. Distinct [SMAUG+] variants are also widespread in wild yeast isolates from multiple niches, establishing that prion polymorphs can be utilized in natural populations. Our data provide a striking example of how protein-based epigenetic switches, hidden in plain sight, can establish a transgenerational memory that integrates adaptive prediction into developmental decisions.

Abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a unique subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a generally aggressive and heterogeneous clinical course. Chemokines are one of the complex components in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and they play a vital role in tumor progression and metastasis. There is no information about the monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG)/CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) axis in patients with MCL. In the present study, we discovered that CXCR3 was highly expressed in MCL tissues and some cell lines including Maver, Z138, and Jeko-1, and significantly associated with clinical factors reflecting high tumor burden in MCL patients. Moreover, elevated serum MIG at diagnosis showed a close relationship with advanced disease and poor prognosis in MCL patients. Additionally, the role of CXCR3 in promoting the proliferation and inhibiting the apoptosis of primary MCL cells and Jeko-1 cells was validated by in vitro experiments. Further research indicated that the MIG/CXCR3 axis mediated MCL cell migration to the TME through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, the MIG/CXCR3 axis might be a potential target with fewer off-target side effects than other targets in MCL.

Abstract: Summary
Tracing DNA repair factors by fluorescence microscopy provides valuable information about how DNA damage processing is orchestrated within cells. Most repair pathways involve single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), making replication protein A (RPA) a hallmark of DNA damage and replication stress. RPA foci emerging during S phase in response to tolerable loads of polymerase-blocking lesions are generally thought to indicate stalled replication intermediates. We now report that in budding yeast they predominantly form far away from sites of ongoing replication, and they do not overlap with any of the repair centers associated with collapsed replication forks or double-strand breaks. Instead, they represent sites of postreplicative DNA damage bypass involving translesion synthesis and homologous recombination. We propose that most RPA and recombination foci induced by polymerase-blocking lesions in the replication template are clusters of repair tracts arising from replication centers by polymerase re-priming and subsequent expansion of daughter-strand gaps over the course of S phase.
