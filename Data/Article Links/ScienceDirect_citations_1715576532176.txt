Abstract: Introduction
In the current scenario, in which evidence-based medicine is almost obligatory, therapeutic approaches are increasingly being restricted to measures that are proven to bring benefits to the patient. Transfusion therapy follows the same concept. Even though it can be an essential support procedure in some situations, it must be carefully used, exclusively in situations in which the literature assures scientific support for its usage. Transfusion exposes patients to risks and complications, so it is necessary that we, as doctors, continue working to reduce possible mistakes involving the practice of this type of therapy.
Objective
To analyze if the red blood cell requests are properly made, analyzing the indication written on them (by the doctor, comparing them to the references in the actual literature.
Method
In this research, we have analyzed and reviewed the requests for red blood cell concentrates between August and September of 2018 received at the Hematology and Hemotherapy Center studied to find the most common mistakes made by requesters/doctors.
Results
A total of 397 of the 754 analyzed requests were evaluated as inadequate. Therefore, 1 out of every 2 transfusions performed did not have their requests properly completed in the city of Cascavel, Paraná.
Conclusions
The number of inappropriate requests was high during the studied period, especially when compared to studies available in the literature. The number of inadequacies suggests that the blood component requests and the subsequent evaluation by the transfusion agency needs to be better addressed in clinical practice.

Abstract: The corrosion behaviors of stainless steels in various high-temperature molten salt have been extensively investigated. However, the tribological behavior of the alloys acting as moving parts in the molten salt is rarely reported. In this work, 316H stainless steel was selected to comparatively study its high-temperature tribo-corrosion performance in molten solar salt (60% NaNO3+40% KNO3, wt.). Under the drying sliding condition, the wear rate increases at 500 °C though the friction coefficient decreases compared to that at room temperature. In contrast, compared to the 500 °C dry sliding condition, the wear resistance of 316H at 500 °C in molten nitrate salt is remarkably improved owing to the lubrication effect of the molten salt and the enhanced oxidation tendency on the worn surface.

Abstract: Converting the UV-blue irradiation into longer wavelength can efficiently ameliorate the insufficient solar spectral response and enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of silicon solar cells, whereas there is still no appropriate strategy to make the corresponding luminescence downshifting materials compatible with commercial silicon photovoltaic modules practically. Herein, we first demonstrate an in-situ fabricated CsPbBr3 PQDs/POE encapsulation adhesive film, which can simultaneously achieve continuously large-scale manufacture through melt extrusion and possess well compatibility with the encapsulation technique of silicon photovoltaic modules. According to the separate granulation preparation and technical optimization, the composited adhesive film exhibits an intensive PL emission at 515 nm with a full width at a half-maximum of 20 nm and an ultra high PLQY of 98.2%. Moreover, less than 5% PL intensity decline even after keeping in 50 °C/90 RH aging condition for >2400 h proves its excellent working stability and barrier property. By means of hot pressing operation, the silicon solar cells encapsulated with CsPbBr3 PQDs/POE adhesive film harvest an absolute PCE enhancement of 0.68%. This work provides a way of great potential towards further improving the silicon photovoltaic industry and corresponding optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Introduction
Oncohematological patients require the evaluation for possible infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS) by neoplastic cells at diagnosis and/or during the monitoring of the chemotherapeutic treatment. Morphological analysis using conventional microscopy is considered the method of choice to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, despite technical limitations.
Objective
This study aimed to compare the performance of the cytomorphology and flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FC) in the detection of CNS infiltration.
Method
We evaluated 520 CSF samples collected from 287 oncohematological patients for whom the detection of neoplastic cells was simultaneously requested by cytomorphology and FC.
Results
Laboratory analyses revealed 435/520 (83.7%) conclusive results by the two methods evaluated, among which 385 (88.5%) were concordant. Discordance between the methods was observed in 50/435 (11.5%) samples, 45 (90%) being positive by FC. Furthermore, the FC defined the results in 69/72 (95.8%) inconclusive samples by cytomorphology. The positivity of FC was particularly higher among hypocellular samples. Among 431 samples with a cell count of < 5/μL, the FC identified neoplastic cells in 75 (17.4%), while the cytomorphology reported positive results in 26 (6%). Among the samples that presented adequate cell recovery for evaluation by both methods (506/520), the comparative analysis between FC and cytomorphology revealed a Kappa coefficient of 0.45 (CI: 0.37–0.52), interpreted as a moderate agreement.
Conclusion
The data showed that the CSF analysis by FC helps in the definition of CNS infiltration by neoplastic cells, particularly in the cases with dubious morphological analysis or in the evaluation of samples with low cellularity.

Abstract: Salinity-gradient osmotic energy conversion is one of the key energy-effective strategies to alleviate global power scarcity and is highly dependent on the saline solution temperature. In this study, a solar thermal boosted salinity-gradient osmotic energy conversion with phase change thermal storage is proposed. Phase change materials (PCMs) are integrated into a solar-driven salinity-gradient osmotic energy conversion system to overcome intermittent solar illumination during the entire diurnal cycle. A graphene oxide membrane (GOM)-based experiment is conducted to study the time-dependent solution temperature, current, and power density with three thermal management materials: Cu/PCM composite, pure PCM, and a reference case without PCM in one diurnal cycle, as well as their periodic stability. The solution temperature can be effectively improved by the solar thermal effect. The utilized PCMs, which absorb solar heat during the daytime and release latent heat at nighttime, can effectively maintain the solution temperature to suppress the power decline at night, thereby improving the power generation capacity of the osmotic system during the entire cycle. The combined interaction mechanism of temperature and solution evaporation on the solution concentration, ion diffusivity, ion conductance, ion selectivity, and power density is revealed. The contributions of ion diffusivity, ion conductance, ion selectivity and solution concentration on the power density are obtained. In an illumination cycle, the power density undergoes three processes of growth stage (0 < t < 5 h), high power output stage (5 < t < 13h), and decline stage (13 < t < 23 h). In addition, the present design also demonstrates a consistent solution temperature and short-current stability during successive cycles.

Abstract: A V2O5 film fabricated by a nanoparticle deposition system (NPDS) was used to demonstrate a highly durable electrochromic device (ECD). The V2O5 film deposited on both the electrodes functioned as a complementary layer during the redox reaction to balance the charge inside the device. Thereby, it mitigated the load applied to the ECD by enabling its electrochromic reaction within the range of ±1 V. The fabricated ECD showing different colors at opposite voltages were applied to both the electrodes. Meanwhile, a TiO2-based opaque electrolyte was used to show different colors of V2O5 thin films independently. The fabricated ECD can display three colors: yellow, green, and blue. Furthermore, each color variation is completed within 10 s. According to the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) data, the color differences (ΔE) between yellow and green, green and blue, and yellow and blue were measured to be approximately 27, 17, and 44, respectively. Meanwhile, the fabricated ECD showed almost a similar level of electrochromic performance even after 500 repeated runs. Moreover, the charge capacity of the ECD after a 10,000-cycle cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis was 49.01 mC/cm2 (the initial charge capacity was measured to be 47.31 mC/cm2). This verified the high durability of the device. Thus, an ECD capable of coloration under a low voltage range of ±1 V was fabricated using a dry deposition method with a TiO2-based opaque electrolyte, to vividly display different colors at both sides of the device simultaneously. The unique device can independently display different colors on both the electrodes. The dry deposition method was applied to deposit an identical V2O5 electrochromic film on the electrodes and an opaque electrolyte. The device has potential applications in functional electrochromic displays.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Introduction
Improving survival of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in adult patients has been a challenge. Despite intensive chemotherapy treatment, overall survival is poor. However, several studies demonstrate that young adult patients have better survival when treated with pediatric-based intensive regimens. Considering these results, We decided to treat newly diagnosed ALL patients according to age and risk factors. The goal of this study was to describe the results of this intensive chemotherapy treatment approach for ALL adult patients diagnosed at our institution.
Methods
Fifty-eight ALL patients, diagnosed from 2004 to 2013, were included in the analysis. Patients were assigned to either the St. Jude Total Therapy XIIIB high-risk arm (St Jude) or the CALGB 8811 (CALGB). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used for the survival analyses and the Cox proportional hazard regression, for multivariable analysis.
Results
The overall survival was 22.9% at 10 years. The St. Jude improved survival, compared to the CALGB (p = 0.007), with 32.6% vs. 7.4% survival rate at 10 years. However, no survival benefit was found for patients younger than 20 years old (p = 0.32). The multivariable analysis demonstrated that undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) had beneficial impact on survival (p = 0.0007 and p = 0.004, respectively).
Conclusion
ALL is a disease of poor prognosis for adults. The joint effort to standardize treatment and seek solutions is the way to start improving this scenario.

Abstract: The vehicle integrated photovoltaic (VIPV) technology, which consists in integrating PV solar panels in the surfaces of electric vehicles, is a promising technology to increase car autonomy. Free-form curved PV surfaces are demanded to meet the specific design constraints of the automotive. The proper characterization of three dimensional PV surfaces requires specific methods and equipment that must be developed. This paper describes the design principles and requirements of a solar simulator for characterization of curved PV modules. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by means of ray-tracing simulations, the results show the advantages provided by the use of a collimated light source in comparison to the conventional solar simulators used for flat modules. The light beam divergence of a non-collimated light source produces a non-uniformity boost between 2% and 20% depending on the module size and curvature. The module performance will be affected by this non-uniform irradiance, but the performance loss will also depend on specific characteristics of the module such as curvature, number and size of cells, series/parallel electrical connection and number of by-pass diodes. On the contrary, the proposed collimated solar simulator reproduces the solar illumination profile over the curved surface. The Helios 3198, a solar simulator with collimated light developed for concentrator modules, has been adapted accordingly to the design proposed. A module of 1 m of curvature has been tested, the short-circuit current of the cells follows the ideal cosine response of the curvature, differences are lower than 0.5% which proves the quality of the collimated beam.

Abstract: Thermochemical energy storage (TCES) technology plays a vital role in utilizing solar energy to produce electricity. However, traditional TCES technologies such as calcium looping route suffer from unsatisfactory long-term durability. Lithium looping has demonstrated excellent cyclic stability, but it has been rarely employed for energy storage. In this work, organolithium-derived Li4SiO4 heat carrier was synthesized and further decorated with alkali doping. The porous microstructures and wrinkled surfaces of organolithium-derived Li4SiO4 were demonstrated, with alkali doping facilitating the formation of low-temperature eutectic materials and reducing CO2 diffusion resistance, thereby enhancing its cyclic energy storage performance. Li4SiO4 doped with 3 wt% K2CO3 shows energy storage density of as high as 638.23 kJ/kg, equal to a high conversion of 81.41% over long storage/release tests of 15 cycles. The high energy density and excellent cyclic durability of Li4SiO4 were attributed to its porous microstructures and formed eutectic melts. Furthermore, for practical application, the carbonation (or heat release) temperature for Li4SiO4 looping TCES system was optimized. To sum up, Li4SiO4 exhibits great potential as a candidate for thermochemical energy storage in solar energy utilization due to its excellent long-term cyclic durability.

Abstract: Leakage-free phase change materials (PCM) are used as passive energy storage systems that thermoregulate indoor environments. In this research, we synthesized highly porous hybrid materials based on non-covalent physical interactions between (poly)ethylene glycol (PEG) and modified cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), namely lignin-containing CNF (LCNF) or acetylated CNF (ACNF). The PEG/CNF hybrid, termed phase change nanohybrids (PCN), were ultra-lightweight (0.022–0.043 g/cm3), mechanically resilient, and displayed a high latent energy storage, up to 204 J/g. The PCN systems (specific heat capacity as high as 2.24 J/g K) were effective in thermal regulating 2.23 °C with a 1 mm thickness coverage while maintaining thermal stability. The PCN also demonstrated favorable thermal management under excess solar heating, providing 33.5 °C of insulative protection with a 1.5 cm thick system. The PCNs have exceptional acoustic absorbance (100% absorbance for 1600 Hz and 50% at lower frequencies, 500 Hz). Trace metal oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles improved the PCN thermoregulating abilities, revealing desirable opportunities in multi-functional applications. Our biobased PCN is a promising insulation and passive energy storage alternative for thermal protection in smart building, electronic, packaging, energy storage system and aerospace sectors.

Abstract: Improving the conversion efficiency of n-TOPCon solar cell is still a hot topic. The selective poly-Si based passivating contacts (Poly-SEs) are ideal candidates for reducing the parasitic absorption and contact resistivity of n-type silicon solar cells and for providing better current collection. In this work, we used LPCVD and the POCl3 tube furnace diffusion methods to fabricate the selective poly-Si based passivating contacts, and studied the influences of key process parameters of the SiOx layer formation process (the oxidation duration (toxidation) and the constant pressure duration (tpressure)), and POCl3 tube diffusion process parameters (the POCl3-N2 carrier gas flow rate at the deposition, deposition temperature, drive-in temperature) on the n+-poly-Si profiles, recombination current density (J0), contact resistivity (ρc) of n-TOPCon solar cells. The results showed that the toxidation and tpressure had a significant impact on J0 and ρc which were mainly related to the distribution number of O and Si4+ content on the growth of the SiOx layer. And the influence of the drive-in temperature of phosphorus (P) diffusion process on J0 value is stronger than that of the deposition temperature, which was mainly related to the chemical passivation of SiOx layer induced by P-indiffusion into Si at high temperature. The reduction in the thickness of poly-Si from 110 nm to 30 nm led to an increase in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) per nanometer of ∼0.0093 mA/cm2 per nm. The Poly-SEs were fabricated by 3D printing mask technology and secondary LPCVD/phosphorus diffusion with J0, n+ ≈ 5 fA/cm2 (n+-poly-Si layer ≈ 50 nm) and J0, metal,n++ ≈ 73.8 fA/cm2 (n++-poly-Si layer ≈ 110 nm), and the efficiency was improved by 0.12% owing to the increase in Jsc value of 0.28 mA/cm2. After optimizing the passivation process, the industrial-grade TOPCon bifacial cells reached an efficiency (Eff), Voc, Jsc, and FF values as high as 25.4%, 721 mV, 42.2 mA/cm2, and 83.5%, respectively.

Abstract: To improve the utilization efficiency of solar energy, Ag@Fe3O4 core-shell nanoparticles with strong light absorption capacity were prepared, and showed good photothermal and photoelectric properties. Synergistic effects of nanoparticle concentration, light intensity and metal foam on photothermal and photoelectric properties were studied. The results showed that the SPR effect of nanoparticles improves the light absorption ability. Compared with deionized water, the addition of nanoparticles can increase the temperature by 6.10% and the power generation efficiency by 18.75%. When the concentration exceeds a certain range, the increase in concentration no longer plays a positive role. The increase of light intensity can increase the voltage and output power by up to 45.28% and 44.78%. However, it will increase the temperature gradient between the surface and the bottom of the nanofluids, increase the heat loss, and lead to a decrease in power generation efficiency. The synergistic effect of nanoparticles and metal foam can better improve the photothermal performance. The addition of metal foam can increase the power generation efficiency by 5.65%.

Abstract: Receiver systems in concentrated solar power plants have to withstand harsh desert conditions and high temperatures, while maintaining high efficiencies converting solar radiation to thermal energy within a heat transfer fluid. The need to improve high absorbing receiver coatings with respect to their lifetime is essential to enhance the economic efficiency of such plants. Diffusion coatings based on Cr and Mn are shown to provide intrinsic self-healing properties forming black Cr–Mn-oxides in situ. Oxidation tests in air are conducted at temperatures between 527 and 710 °C up to 100 h. Thereby, solar absorptances up to 93% and optical coatings efficiencies up to 80% are obtained on coated VM12 steel with the best coating performance shown at around 650 °C. Thermocyclic oxidation for up to 640 h at a maximum temperature of 650 °C proves that there is a slight drop in solar absorptance after around 50 h of exposure, but afterwards it remains stable. Additionally, it is found that coated VM12 performs better in comparison to P91 steel. A mechanism of oxide formation and coating consumption is proposed showing the importance of Mn diffusion on oxide formation. In the beginning of the exposure, Mn2O3 and cubic MnxCr3-xO4 (β-spinel) form, which transform to tetragonal MnxCr3-xO4 (α-spinel) and with continuing exposure also to Cr2O3. For analysis, metallographic investigations are combined with methods such as Raman-spectroscopy, XRD, spectrophotometry, qualitative and quantitative EPMA measurements.

Abstract: The viologen-based gel is typical kind of electrochromic materials, there are currently two main limited problems for application in electrochromic devices (ECD). The electrochromic layer may be damaged due to aging, film stress, etc., or viologen dimerization occurs after repeated service cycles, which have a significant impact on the reliability of ECD. To address these limitations, we synthesized benzyl boronic acid viologen (BBV) and mixed it with an electrolyte containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The boronic acid group in BBV can form boronic ester linkages with the hydroxyl group in PVA, resulting in a self-healing all-in-one electrochromic gel. The immobilized viologen with boronic ester linkages would slow down its diffusion rate and effectively mitigate its poor cycling stability caused by dimerization. Meanwhile, the reversibility of the dynamically cross-linked boronic ester linkages leads to self-healing ability of the electrochromic gel. The all-in-one electrochromic gel demonstrated excellent mechanical properties, with a tensile strength of 33 kPa, and significant self-healing performance within 30 min at room temperature, with a healing efficiency of 96.57%. The ECD prepared using this gel exhibited excellent properties, with a response time of 3.9 s for coloring and 7.4 s for bleaching at a driving voltage of 0 to 1.3 V, as well as good optical contrast (71.33%) and high cycling stability (10,000 cycles/82.66%).

Abstract: Solid-solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) with low volume change, no leakage, lack of corrosion and extensive service lives are used more and more widely in the application field of thermal energy storage (TES). In this study, eco-friendly polylactic acid (PLA)/polyurethane (PU) phase change composites with good recyclability and excellent form stability for TES were obtained by melt blending in a twin-screw eccentric rotor extruder. The experimental results show that the introduction of PLA is helpful to enhance the mechanical strength and leak-free performance of the PLA/PU composites. When the content of PLA achieved 20% in the PLA/PU composites, the relative enthalpy efficiency (η) of PP-20 is 79.14%, which is beneficial for the function of TES. Especially, PP-40 showed excellent flexibility, reversibility and durability whose tensile stress (14.0 MPa) and tensile strain (48.15%) were pretty good at room temperature. After reprocessed many times, PP-40 showed good recyclability whose enthalpy of fusion reduced (60.69 J/g) but could still reach 91.51% of the original. The above results imply that the PLA/PU composites provide an efficient way for the green use and reprocessing of SSPCMs in the field of TES.

Abstract: Conventional recycling methods to separate pure silicon from photovoltaic cells rely on complete dissolution of metals like silver and aluminium and the recovery of insoluble silicon by employing multiple leaching reagents. A common approach that eschews hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment is the double reagent approach which utilizes nitric acid (HNO3) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) to separate the metals from silicon cell. However, the double reagent approach is unable to remove the anti-reflective coating and use of KOH leads to formation of insoluble precipitates, in turn affecting the purity of recovered silicon. Herein, we report a single reagent approach for a streamlined process for recovery of high purity silicon with unmatched recovery yield. Phosphoric acid, (H3PO4) identified as a reagent for this approach, directly targets the anti-reflective coating and separates the Ag and Al present on the Si wafer surfaces. This approach led to an impressive recovery rate of 98.9% with a high purity of 99.2%, as determined by X-ray fluorescence and Inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. Such high-purity of recovered silicon enables upcycling into anodes for lithium-ion battery, with the battery performance comparable to as-purchased silicon. Such recovered silicon lithium-ion battery anodes demonstrated a high specific capacity of 1086.6 mAh g−1 (62.3% of its initial specific capacity), even after 500 cycles at a high charging rate of 1.0C while maintaining high coulombic efficiency (>99%).

Abstract: Introduction
Although extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a promising second-line therapy in the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), its use is limited by its high cost. This study aims to describe the clinical evolution of patients who underwent ECP therapy for cGVHD and to perform an economic analysis of the therapy
Methods
This was a case series between 2016 and 2020 describing the clinical response to ECP and a micro-cost analysis of the therapy using time-driven activity-based costing.
Results
Six patients underwent ECP for corticosteroid-dependent cGVHD The cost per ECP session is 14,960.90 Brazilian reais (BRL), which primarily consists of the ECP kit with an activator (82.78%), followed by the hospital's physical structure (14.66%), human resources (2.48%) and exams/inputs (0.08%). The number of sessions performed ranged from 2 to 42. The total cost of the therapy per patient ranged from BRL 30,000 to 500,000.
Conclusion
The response of the patient with cGVHD to treatment with ECP was variable. These micro-costing results can be used to develop remuneration and cost control strategies in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation programs, as well as in further economic studies.

Abstract: We have investigated bifacial Ge-incorporated Sb2Se3 thin-film solar cells by modeling and simulating a back buffer layer including Cu2O to optimize the bifacial device performance. A Ge-incorporated Sb2Se3 absorber layer was grown using Vapor Transport Deposition to extract the input parameters for the simulation, followed by exploring the properties of the transparent back buffer layer. After selecting a Cu2O back buffer layer, we conducted the optimization study of bifacial Ge-doped Sb2Se3 devices by varying a set of devices and materials parameters. The optical bandgap is characterized as 1.23 eV for Ge-incorporated Sb2Se3 absorber and the absorption coefficient is 3 × 105 cm−1 at 600 nm. Using these input parameters, we simulated the device configuration of ZnO:Al/i-ZnO/CdS/Ge-Sb2Se3/back buffer layer/transparent conductive oxide. Firstly, we checked the impact of conduction and valence band offsets on device performance, indicating the valence band offset of the back buffer layer plays a significant role. In particular, zero or small positive valence band offset minimizes a Schottky hole barrier, which could reduce hole current clamping near the back buffer region. As for back buffer doping concentration, high back buffer doping concentration (1 × 1015 cm−3 or higher) is required to improve device performance even with zero valence band offset, whereas low absorber doping concentration (<1 × 1014 cm−3) enables higher efficiency due to the enlarged energy band bending. For bifacial device performance, a Cu2O back buffer layer is simulated by varying critical input parameters such as absorber thickness, doping concentration, and defect concentration near the back buffer interface. The best efficiency of front-side illumination is 19.7%, Voc (744.4 mV), Jsc (40.14 mA/cm2), and FF (66.1%) and that of the rear-side illumination is 13.0%, Voc (724.5 mV), Jsc (31.6 mA/cm2), and FF (56.7%). Consequently, the bifaciality factor is 66%.

Abstract: We study the preparation of high-quality p-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (p-TOPCon) using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technology in this work. We propose to use different plasmas to treat the ultrathin SiOx to improve the passivation quality of p-TOPCon. Experimentally, we use the nitric acid oxidation (NAOS) SiOx as the precursor and use pure N2, pure H2, and N2O/H2 plasmas to treat the SiOx precursor layer. Three observations are found. 1) Pure H2 plasma treatment can improve the SiOx quality by increasing the Si4+ content, but the passivation quality is not improved because of the etching effect of H2 plasma and the reduction of SiOx thickness. 2) The pure N2O plasma can improve the passivation quality but increases the contact resistivity (ρc) because of the increase of the SiOx thickness. 3) The N2O/H2 plasma treatment improves the passivation quality more effectively than pure N2O plasma, and meanwhile, it also keeps the contact resistivity at an acceptable value for high-efficiency solar cells. We assume that the atomic H provides the energy to etch the weak and dangling bonds and make SiOx thinner, while the atomic O that makes SiOx thickness unchanged balances the etching effect of atomic H. With the optimized N2O/H2 plasma treatment, the passivation quality of p-TOPCon is improved, featuring the best implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of ∼732 mV and the lowest single-sided saturation current density (J0,s) of ∼6 fA/cm2 on the lifetime sample with the n-type silicon substrate and the AlOx/SiNx capping layer. These results demonstrate that the plasma treatment is a promising way to boost the passivation quality of PECVD p-TOPCon structures. Finally, as an example, we use numerical simulation to predict the performances of the solar cells integrating the p-TOPCon structure on the rear side of n-c-Si and demonstrate a 24.8% efficiency with the p-TOPCon whose SiOx is improved by the optimized plasma treatment.

Abstract: Thermochemical energy storage has broad application prospect with the advantages of high energy density and trans-regional storage capability. For MgCO3/MgO reaction couple, conversion rate of MgO carbonation with molten alkali nitrates is significantly enhanced. However, its kinetic mechanism is still controversial. In this work, molecular dynamics research on MNO3-MgO-CO2 (M is Li/Na/K/Na0.n5K0.5) interface was carried out to reveal the mechanism and regulate its performance. Results indicate that MNO3 plays a dominant role in facilitating MgO(s) → Mg2+ + O2− after melting. Lattice distortion is observed on the surface of MgO due to oxygen ion exchange between NO3– and MgO, breaking MgO balance. Interestingly, generated oxygen vacancies become highly reactive sites. Overall, the participation of molten MNO3 gives rise to triple-phase boundary that works as a efficient pathway for CO2 to penetrate deeper into MgO. Subsequently, structure-activity relationships between microstructure and carbonation kinetics was proposed. Among all the dopants studied, Na0.5K0.5NO3 not only creates strong distortion of the MgO lattice with oxygen defect concentration of 0.0787 mol%, but also exhibits a small-contact angle of 67.5° on MgO at 320 °C and 0.1 MPa, boosting MgO carbonation. The ambient temperature plays opposite effects on interface wettability of molten MNO3 and thermodynamic driving force, causing a parabolic kinetics with a peak rate at 332 °C. Small and uniformly dispersed dopants are beneficial for energy carriers to adsorb CO2. The above regulation provides a guiding principle for the preparation of thermochemical energy carriers in subsequent applications.

Abstract: Intense illumination treatments on silicon heterojunction cells (SHJ) have recently gained interest to improve the final cell efficiency and are now being implemented into cell manufacturing tools. However, additional efforts are still required to clarify the robustness of such approach. Indeed, it has been reported that the positive effects of the intense illumination treatments applied to cells may be partly lost during module assembly. Therefore, in order to circumvent these potential issues, we reveal herein a broad investigation on the interest of intense illumination treatments directly at module level, using an experimental lab tool provided by Applied Materials, Baccini (Italy). Efficiency gains up to +0.3 %abs have been achieved within a treatment process time compatible with industry requirements. The gains remained stable for two months after a slight decrease during the first days (−0.05 %abs). Moreover, the reliability tests against UV, thermal cycling and damp heat did not reveal any detrimental influence of the post-treatments applied to the modules, further highlighting the fast illumination post-treatment as promising candidate for the next generation of high technologically advanced photovoltaic modules manufacturing production lines.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Introduction
Haploinsufficiency of the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA2 is associated with a broad spectrum of diseases, including infection susceptibility and neoplasms. We aimed to investigate GATA2 variants in patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) and/or fungal infections (FI) without known immunodeficiencies.
Method
We performed GATA2 genotyping in patients with NTM and/or FI.
Results
Twenty-two patients were enrolled (seventeen FI, four NTM and one with both infections). The pathogenic variant NG_029334.1:g.16287C>T was found in one patient (4.5%) and two asymptomatic offsprings. We also found the likely-benign variant NG_029334.1:g.12080G>A (rs2335052), the benign variant NG_029334.1:g.16225C>T (rs11708606) and the variant of uncertain significance NG_029334.1:g.16201G>A (rs369850507) in 18.2%, 27.3%, and 4.5% of the cases, respectively. Malignant diseases were additionally diagnosed in six patients.
Conclusion
Although detected in 45.4% of the patients, most GATA2 variants were benign or likely benign. Identifying a pathogenic variant was essential for driving both the patient's treatment and familial counseling. Pathogenic variants carriers should receive genetic counseling, subsequent infection prevention measures and malignancies surveillance. Additionally, case-control genotyping should be carried out in Brazil to investigate whether the observed variants may be associated with susceptibility to opportunistic infections and/or concurrent neoplasms.

Abstract: Thermal Energy Storage (TES) based on molten salts is thought to play a major role for the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy carriers in the future. Solar Salt, a mixture of NaNO3–KNO3 is currently the state-of-the-art heat transfer and storage material in Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants which produce electricity from a Rankine cycle with steam temperatures up to 550 °C. To allow a technology transfer and adapt Solar Salt based TES systems to modern, high temperature Rankine cycles (e.g. Tsteam > 600 °C), the thermal stability of Solar Salt needs to be increased well above 615 °C. At these temperatures, the formation of nitrites, which depends on the oxygen partial pressure above the melt, needs to be suppressed effectively to prevent further decomposition into corrosive oxide ions. In this work, the thermodynamics of the nitrite-forming reaction at different oxygen partial pressure are explored in a temperature range up to 650 °C from isothermal experiments in the 100 g-scale and limitations of the ideal description are revealed. The measured apparent oxide ion formation rates at 100 g-scale were below previous findings. The activation energy found was 60 ± 15 kJ/mol and the preexponential factor 1*10−5±0.00005s−1. The effect of closing the storage system in terms of gas and salt phase at 645 °C are also explored to understand if and how pressure formation and oxygen release correlate. The results of this work finally contribute to an understanding of the decomposition reactions of Solar Salt at previously untouched temperatures.

Abstract: Moisture ingress is one of the key fault mechanisms responsible for photovoltaic (PV) devices degradation. Understanding moisture induced degradation (MID) mechanisms in field-aged PV modules is more reflective of the reality in the field. In the present work, MID products of reclaimed solar cells from 20-year-old field-aged silicon PV modules is investigated. The defective areas in the PV modules were identified using visual inspection, electroluminescence (EL), ultraviolet fluorescence (UV–F), and infrared thermal (IR-T) techniques. SEM-EDS analysis is used to elucidate the role of moisture on the observed degradation mechanisms. Degradation of the ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulation produces acetic acid, carbon dioxide, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, and chlorine. Migration of metal ions under the influence of moisture ingress makes the formation of oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, phosphates, acetates, and carbonates of silver, lead, tin, copper, zinc, and aluminum feasible. Also, other competing reactions can lead to the formation of stannates of copper, silver, sodium, and zinc. Another observation is that, in the presence of MID species, Pb is preferentially corroded (to form lead acetate complexes) instead of the expected sacrificial Sn in the solder. These MID species account for different defects and fault modes that lead to parasitic resistance losses. This is witnessed by the 1.2%/year degradation in the Pmax of the PV module.

Abstract: Efficient absorption of solar radiation with minimal thermal losses is required for efficient solar-to-thermal energy conversion. For this purpose, spectrally selective and omnidirectional surfaces are required that have strong, ideally unity, absorption in the solar spectral window for all incident angles and low, ideally zero, emissivity in the spectral range of blackbody radiation at operating temperature. In this article, we propose theoretically and experimentally lithographic free broadband and omnidirectional solar absorber for high-temperature applications made in a dielectric-metal-dielectric-metal fashion. We have used chromium (Cr), titanium (Ti), and tungsten (W) as a metal layer in the designed absorber due to their high thermal stability at high temperatures and compared their performance. The power balance equation is used to calculate the steady-state temperature considering free and forced convection conditions. W-based absorber shows >90% absorption in the solar window below cutoff wavelength for blackbody working at 600 K with <10% emissivity in the thermal window. Finally, we fabricate the W-based sample and experimentally measure the temperature rise of 100 K under one sun condition. The designed absorber can be used for several solar-thermal applications including solar-steam to electricity generation, water purification, space heating, and solar-thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Poly (ADPRibose) Polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) are clinically approved for the treatment of BRCA-mutated hereditary breast and ovarian cancers with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, based on synthetic lethality concept. However, ∼90% of breast cancers are BRCA-wild type; they repair PARPi mediated damage through HR, leading to intrinsic de novo resistance. Hence, there is an unmet need of exploring novel targets in HR-proficient aggressive breast cancers for PARPi treatment. RECQL5 physically interacts and disrupts RAD51 from pre-synaptic filaments, aiding HR resolution, replication fork protection and preventing illegitimate recombination. In the current investigation, we show that targeted inhibition of HR by stabilization of RAD51-RECQL5 complex by a pharmacological inhibitor of RECQL5 (4a; 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivative) in the presence of PARPi [talazoparib (BMN673)] leads to abolition of functional HR with uncontrolled activation of NHEJ repair. This was assessed by GFP based NHEJ reporter assay, KU80 recruitment and in vitro NHEJ based plasmid ligation assay. Concomitant treatment with talazoparib and 4a generates copious amounts of replication stress, prolonged cell cycle arrest, extensive double strand breaks (DSBs) and mitotic catastrophe, leading to sensitization of HR-proficient breast cancers. Suppression of NHEJ activity abolishes 4a-mediated sensitization of breast cancers to PARPi treatment. Imperatively, 4a was ineffective against normal mammary epithelial cells, which expresses low RECQL5 vis-à-vis breast cancer cells. Moreover, functional inhibition of RECQL5 suppresses metastatic potential of breast cancer cells in response to PARPi. Together, we identified RECQL5 as a novel pharmacological target for expanding PARPi based treatment horizon for HR-proficient cancers.

Abstract: Introduction
Intrathecal chemotherapy is a mainstay component of acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. In Mexico, there is a considerable practice variability in aspects, such as the manner of preparation and the administration technique.
Objective
Our objective was to describe the different techniques used for the application of ITC and review the existing recommendations in the literature.
Method
A cross-sectional, nationwide survey study was conducted by an electronic questionnaire sent to hematologists and oncologists in Mexico. We collected demographic data, personal experience, intrathecal chemotherapy techniques, drug preparation and postprocedural conduct.
Results
We received 173 responses. Twenty percent had an anesthesiologist administering sedation and pain management. The platelet count considered safe was 50 × 109/L in 48% of the participants. In 77% (n = 133) of the cases, the conventional needle with stylet used was, 49% did not receive any added diluent in the intrathecal chemotherapy and only 42% were recommended to rest in a horizontal position for more than 30 min.
Conclusion
We identified a considerable variation in the administration of intrathecal chemotherapy across the hematologists in Mexico. We discuss the implications and opportunities in reducing the variation in our setting, highlighting the unmet need to establish guidelines that should be evaluated by the Mexican professional society to produce a position paper regarding practice standardization.

Abstract: Solar photovoltaic (PV) energy is a crucial supply technology in the envisioned renewable energy system. With enormous amounts of PV modules being installed, some will be affected by early-life failures and the resulting e-waste from PV modules is raising environmental concerns. A failure of growing importance is the defect in the glass layer(s) of glass-glass PV modules. In this research, an experimental glass repair technique for glass-glass PV modules was tested and examined. The PV modules with glass defects under test did not show internal defects in the PV cells, while the repaired specimens performed properly at each phase in the repair process compared to reference modules, the IEC standards and manufacturer warranty. After a damp-heat test the repaired PV modules showed no signs of water ingress, suggesting that the glass layer was restored as a proper barrier. However, definite conclusions should be made with caution since the non-repaired specimens neither showed visible signs of water ingress. While the practical application of the reparation technique has still some uncertainties, glass reparation is found to be technically feasible and effective. Furthermore, economic and energetic analyses indicate that glass defect reparation is economically interesting and energetically desirable.

Abstract: In pursuit of high-performance electrochromic conjugated polymers (ECPs), three benzotriazole-thiophene ECPs employing benzotriazole as acceptor and different thiophene repeating units as donors, namely, PBTz-T, PBTz-BT, and PBTz-TT, were synthesized via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DHAP). Meanwhile, following the above ECPs model, we investigated the effect of corresponding conjugated chain length of monomers on their optical, electrochemical and electrochromic properties. The results showed that along with the increase of the numbers of thiophene in the repeating unit of ECPs, the electronic and optical band gaps decreased, the UV–Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra showed significant bathochromic shift, and the electrochemical cycle stability gradually improved. PBTz-T exhibited giant coloration efficiency (916 cm2 C−1 at 530 nm), which is one of the best results in the visible region. And higher coloration efficiency means less energy consumption, which holds great potential for various applications, including electrochromic back covers of smartphones. PBTz-BT displayed the highest transmittance (28% at 550 nm), and BTz-TT illustrated the fastest switching time (0.6 s/0.5 s for doping/dedoping process). Flexible electrochromic device (ECD) fabricated employed PBTz-T as functional layer gradually changed from red (reduction) to dark green (oxidation), and maintained good cycling stability.

Abstract: In this work, PbO-TeO2-Bi2O3-SiO2 lead-containing glass and TeO2-Bi2O3-ZnO-Li2O lead-free glass were synthesized in order to investigate the difference between them and find out the reason why lead-free paste can't be used on monocrystalline wafer commercially. Their flowability and reactivity with SiNx were characterized. Lead-free glass presents lower flow temperature, better wettability and stronger etching ability to SiNx than lead-containing glass. Button test was carried out and large white particles was identified on the interface for lead-free glass. These results indicates the excessive flowability and etching to SiNx for lead-free glass. The morphology of grid line and interface between silver electrode and silicon wafer were investigated on dependence of temperature. The lead-containing and lead-free glasses went through similar evolution of silver sintering and interface microstructure with lead-free glass better facilitating silver sintering through liquid phase sintering due to its lower flow temperature. The thicker glass layer and more Ag crystallites with large size can be observed from cross-sectional micrographs for lead-free glass. Therefore, lead-free paste exhibits lower Voc and FF than lead-containing glass owing to its ecxessive corrosion of SiNx, thicker glass layer and large Ag crystallites.

Abstract: This work investigates the temperature dependence of the performance of In(Ga)As-based solar cells made from sub-monolayer (SML) quantum dots (QDs), quantum wells (QWs), and Stranski-Krastanov QDs (SK-QDs). Well-defined sub-bandgap peaks are observed in external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for all samples. Apparently, changes in minority carrier lifetime affect both the sub-bandgap and the above bandgap EQE. Lateral confinement of carriers in the SMLs and QDs also affects the temperature dependence of the EQE. Finally, a “U” shaped curve was observed from the temperature dependence of the short-circuit current (ISC) from these nanostructure-based solar cells. This is due to the competition between the decreasing bandgap and the increasing carrier loss to recombination within the nanostructures as the temperature increases. In contrast, the solar cell's open-circuit voltage and power efficiency decrease monotonically with temperature.

Abstract: Tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells have gradually dominated the industrial silicon solar cells. In this paper, we have adopted the tube plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technology integrating with nano SiOx (Tox) and in-situ phosphorus-doped polysilicon (n + poly-Si), in which Tox is prepared by plasma-assisted oxygen (O2) oxidation. Passivation and contact performance of TOPCon solar cells have been investigated under different thicknesses of Tox, and the following simulation has confirmed the optimal electrical properties, i.e., the implied open-circuit voltage (iVOC) of the hydrogenated lifetime sample is promoted to more than 736.1 mV on the textured wafer, corresponding to a lowest single-sided saturation current density (J0) of 4.6 fA/cm2, and the contact resistivity of 1.55 mΩ cm2 extracted from the transmission line method. Characterizations are carried out to conform the rear stack passivation layers satisfy the requirement of the high-efficiency TOPCon solar cells. Finally, we have fabricated the large-sized TOPCon solar cells with an average efficiency of 24.5% and a maximum efficiency of 24.7%, respectively. The above work has demonstrated the tube PECVD technology integrating with plasma-assisted O2 oxidation and in-situ doped poly-Si has the potential for the mass-production TOPCon in industry.

Abstract: Dopant-free passivating contacts have the potential to be deposited at low costs while exhibiting excellent electrical performance for photovoltaic devices. However, one significant issue of such a technology is the unsatisfactory environmental stability compared to the conventional doped-silicon contacts. Herein, we propose a strategy for improving the stability and the electrical properties of typical electron-selective contacts (ESCs) with a i-a-Si:H/LiF/Al stack by inserting thermally evaporated thin metal films as protective layers. Particularly, Yb, Mg, Ti and Ni materials are investigated in detail to address their electrical behaviors, including contact and passivation properties, as well as their stability under annealing treatments. Finally, the Ti-modified ESC exhibited the highest device performance and the best thermal stability, enabling the development of front and back contacted silicon heterojunction solar cells with a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.14% and maintaining more than 90% of the initial PCE after annealing at 200 °C. The protective metal layer deposited by a facile approach offers a surplus of opportunity to develop high-efficient and cost-effective dopant-free crystalline silicon solar cells.

Abstract: This paper describes the fabrication of bandgap grading Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells via sputtering and post-selenization/sulfurization using SeS2 powder as a sulfur source. The material characteristics and photovoltaic performances of the solar cells were assessed as functions of S/(S + Se) ratio. In experiments, an appropriate S/(S + Se) ratio resulted in grains with the preferred vertical orientation and fewer grain boundaries (GB) to hinder carrier transport, which together reduced charge transfer resistance. A suitable S/(S + Se) ratio also resulted in an S depth profile with a V-shaped distribution, which allowed bandgap grading in the depletion region. An excessively high S/(S + Se) ratio gradually altered the energy band at GBs from downward bending to upward bending, which increased the likelihood of electron-hole recombination at GBs. A high S/(S + Se) ratio also promoted excessive grain growth in various directions, which increased surface roughness and prevented the uniform coverage of the CdS layer, thereby reducing device performance. The optimal S/(S + Se) ratio of 0.27 resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.1%, which is a new efficiency record for antimony chalcogenide-based thin film solar cells prepared via sputtering and post-selenization.

Abstract: With focus on a higher heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency, future developments in the field of thermal energy storage are aiming at higher operational temperatures. For that, increased decomposition rates of nitrate and nitrite are the limiting factor. Until now only small-scale laboratory experiments have been performed at temperatures above 565 °C. This study presents the to our knowledge for the first-time experiment on the thermal stability of Solar Salt (60 wt-% NaNO3, 40 wt-% KNO3) at temperatures up to 600 °C with synthetic air purge gas flow in a 100 kg scale. The key to the received data is a build-in gas system with direct gas analyzer, a sample extraction system and post-analysis of salt samples, that allows determination of molten salt decomposition products. Our research provides clear evidence of the feasibility in elevating the reactor temperature to 600 °C.

Abstract: Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is most commonly presented in older adults; however, it appears 10 years earlier in Latin American countries. Clinical evolution in older adults from this populations has not been characterized. We analyzed outcomes and survival predictors.
Methods
Patients ≥ 55 years old diagnosed with AML at a hematology referral center from 2005 to 2020 receiving intensive chemotherapy (IC), low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) and best supportive care (BSC) were included. Survival analysis included the Kaplan-Meier and Cox models and the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR).
Results
Seventy-five adults were included and the overall survival (OS) was 4.87, 1.67 and 1.16 months, using IC, LDAC and BSC, respectively. The IC led to a higher OS (p < 0.001) and was a protective factor for early death, at a cost of more days spent hospitalized and more non-fatal treatment complications; non-significant differences were found between the LDAC and BSC. Eight (10.7%) patients underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation, with a higher OS (p = 0.013). Twenty (26.7%) patients achieved complete remission; 12 (60%) relapsed with a 6-month CIR of 57.9% in those < 70 years old vs. 86.5% in those ≥ 70 years old, p = 0.034. Multivariate analysis showed the white blood cell count (WBC) and IC had a significant impact on the patient survival, whereas chronological age and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) did not.
Conclusion
AML in low-middle income countries demands a different approach; the IC improves survival, even with a high incidence of relapse, and should be offered as first-line treatment. Eligibility criteria should include WBC and a multidimensional evaluation. The age per se and the CCI should not be exclusion criteria to consider IC.

Abstract: The figure of merit (FOM) is a widely used metric to characterize the solar-thermal conversion performance of solar absorber layers. Many of previous works have reported FOMs estimated from the radiative properties measured at room temperature. However, advanced concentrated solar power (CSP) plants operate at very high temperatures (∼750°C), which can strongly affect the absorber’s radiative properties. The present work proposes using a 1-D conduction-based reference bar technique to directly measure the converted thermal energy to determine the FOM at high absorber temperatures (≳750°C) while operating under a large solar concentration (∼1200× suns). Using the finite difference method, we carefully analyze several key parameters influencing the design of the experimental setup, such as temperature distribution, material properties, heat loss, and sensor accuracy. In addition, a rigorous uncertainty analysis is incorporated into the FOM to ascertain the confidence level of the result. We validate this new technique on a custom-built tungsten reference bar with an oxidized Inconel 625 solar-thermal absorber. A good agreement between the model and the experiment shows the reliability of the FOM measurement with a well-defined uncertainty. The same method can be implemented to measure the high-temperature FOM of most surface or volumetric solar absorbers for CSP.

Abstract: Hafnium oxide (HfO2) thin film has received tremendous research interests as a passivation layer of crystalline silicon (c-Si) due to its thermal stability and positive fixed charges. HfO2 films were prepared both on P-type and N-type polished c-Si via a remote plasma atomic layer deposition process. Post annealing was carried out in oxygen, atmosphere (Air) and nitrogen (N2) at temperature of 500 °C. Electrical characterization was done through a regular metal-insulator-semiconductor structure and capacitance-voltage measurements. The oxide fixed charge (Qf) and density of interface traps (Dit) between HfO2 and c-Si were extracted. Qf and Dit reveal the potential of HfO2 for field effect and chemical passivation, respectively. Effective lifetime measurements by microwave photoconductivity decay in Si wafers passivated with HfO2 were applied to characterize surface recombination velocity to directly evaluate the overall passivation quality. The impacts of post-annealing gas ambient on passivation qualities on Si by HfO2 thin films are systematically studied. The results show that N2-annealed sample possesses the highest Qf of 1.73 × 1012 cm−2 and therefore provides the best field effect passivation. Air-annealed sample has lowest Dit of 1.0 × 1012 eV−1cm−2 and therefore provides the best chemical passivation. Air-annealed sample possesses the highest effective lifetime of 290 μs at injection level of 1 × 1015 cm−3, which means that good passivation was obtained for N-type Si wafer passivated with HfO2 after annealing in Air.

Abstract: Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) receivers, especially those adopted in Solar Tower (ST) configurations, operate at high temperatures and low stresses making them susceptible to creep damage. Creep modelling used to predict components' life and therefore the accuracy of creep modelling can significantly impact life estimation, prediction of failures, and ultimately the design. The accuracy of creep modelling is highly variable and depends on the choice of model, the choice of fitting functions, and sometimes depends on ‘judgement’ decisions by the modeller. In this article the Larson-Miller and Wilshire creep models are fitted to three common power generation materials (Grade 22, SS316 and Inconel 740H) with differently sized datasets. Region splitting via activation energy is also examined. The fits are examined for accuracy and bias for stress, temperature and rupture time by a statistical process of bootstrapping to provide a better understanding of the impact of the creep model and dataset size on the design and lifing of CSP receivers.

Abstract: Spinel oxide host MgAl2O4 was chemically engineered to derive solar reflective colored pigments. The spinel oxides of the formula MgAl2-xFexO4 (x = 0.5–2.0) and Mg1-xMxAl₂O₄ (x = 0.1–0.5, M = Cu, Ni, Mn) were synthesized by combustion route. Cationic disorder in the parent MgAl2O4 was noted to transform into ordered arrangement with Fe3+ and Mn2+ ionic substitution. Fe3+ ion substitution imparted brick brown color of varied hue. Whereas, substitution of Mg2+ ion by Mn2+ and Ni2+ (x = 0.1) ions resulted in coffee brown color of light and dark shades and cyan color respectively. The optical band gap of the host (3.9 eV) decreased to 2.6–2.0 eV with Fe3+ substitution, 2.5–2.0 eV with Mn2+ ion substitution and with Ni2+ ion substitution showed slight decrease to 3.8 eV. The % solar reflectance of the phases MgAl2-xFexO4 was determined to be 73–80% with 80% in the case of MgAl1·0Fe1·0O4.

Abstract: The photothermal effect is proved to favor the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation, but the impact of the photothermal effect on the band bending in the heterojunction has seldom been revealed. In this work, we constructed a Z schematic heterojunction by heteroatoms doping, the carbon quantum dots (CQDs) was anchored to trigger the local heat under the NIR irradiation. With the photothermal effect, the photocurrent density of (Ti, Zn)–Fe2O3@Ti–Fe2O3 reached 1.02 mA/cm2 (1.23 VRHE), 2.30 mA/cm2 (1.60 VRHE), which yielded an increased by 1.3 folds, 1.7 folds, respectively. Detailed studies showed that the photothermal effect would enlarge the contact potential difference in the heterojunction and band bending at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface (SEI). Furthermore, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics was also accelerated, which was evidenced by the Tafel slope decreasing from 88 mV/decade to 78 mV/decade. Despite the photovoltage being reduced, the advantages of the photothermal effect still out weighted the disadvantages.

Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon oxide (a-SiOx:H) alloy is considered as a promising alternative to hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in crystalline silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells due to its reduced parasitic absorption induced by the incorporation of oxygen. However, the large valence band offset (ΔEV) between a-SiOx:H and crystalline silicon (c-Si) usually leads to low fill factor (FF) for the solar cells. Here, we designed a trilyer a-SiOx:H(i) stacked passivation scheme underneath the rear emitter (p) for the SHJ solar cell on n-type c-Si wafer via depositing the a-SiOx:H(i) layers with different oxygen contents by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Highly efficient SHJ solar cells with the average efficiency of 25.37% were obtained by optimizing the trilayer a-SiOx:H(i) passivation structure with an oxygen-rich layer inserted between two oxygen-less layers. Comparing to the solar cells with complete a-Si:H passivation layers, higher short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the solar cells were achieved, which indicated excellent passivation and low parasitic absorption contributed from the a-SiOx:H(i) stacked layers. At the same time, FF of the solar cells was also increased slightly. The corresponding improvement mechanisms were analyzed carefully. As a demonstration, the highest efficiency of the SHJ solar cells passivated by the trilayer a-SiOx:H(i) scheme for rear emitter was up to 25.44%.

Abstract: In this study, the edge passivation effectiveness and long-term stability of Nafion polymer in n-type interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells are investigated. For new module technologies such as half-cut, triple-cut, or shingled modules, cutting of the cells introduces unpassivated edges with a high recombination rate and this limits the module power. These cut edges can be “repassivated” after cutting and in this work Nafion polymer is used to achieve this. First, different edge types, namely emitter edges (n+/n/p+) and back surface field (BSF) edges (n+/n/n+), as well as different cutting techniques such as laser cut and cleave (L&C), thermal laser separation (TLS), and mechanical cleaving are evaluated. It is found that TLS and mechanical cleaving enable good repassivation on both BSF and emitter edges. Second, industrial-size IBC solar cells are made to assess the effect of the edge repassivation on performance. On 1/4-cut M2 size IBC cells with two emitter edges, efficiency is improved by over 0.3%abs. However, an efficiency improvement was not observed for similar cells with BSF edges, due to an insufficient passivation at the bulk edges. Last, the real-world stability of the Nafion repassivation is evaluated in industrially relevant module stacks by laminating the repassivated wafers with ethylvinylacetate (EVA) or polyolefin elastomer (POE) encapsulants and then exposing them to industry standard testing of 1000 h under damp heat conditions (85 °C, 85% relative humidity). The tests reveal that the repassivation is stable in EVA encapsulants but not in POE.

Abstract: Introduction
Brazil has many inequities in the healthcare provided nationwide. Therefore, in order to access challenges in treatment, available resources and current practices, to identify barriers in delivering a good quality of care among Brazilian centers treating children and adolescents with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and to generate a future prospective guideline, a customized online survey was distributed to pediatric hematologists and oncologists across the country.
Results
A total of 97 surveys were completed (35% response rate), from 47 cities in all Brazilian regions and 79 units of care, with a median of 1 answer by the center (range 1 - 5). Most respondents work at an institution supported exclusively by public/philanthropic resources (58%), with an average of 5 to 9 new cases/year (49%), and 41% have 4 to 6 oncologists/centers. Additionally, 22% have no easy access to the intensive care unit, 26% have no access to Rasburicase, 28% have no access to Rituximabe as front-line therapy and 41% have unreliable methotrexate monitoring levels. Those differences cannot be explained thoroughly by regional wealth variances, nor by the financing model. Regarding the pathology service, 70% consider having reasonable quality assistance, but the timeframe to deliver diagnosis is satisfactory to 46%. There is no uniform management of care, with the current guideline from the Sociedade Brasileira de Oncologia Pediátrica being adopted by 54 to 59%, depending on the NHL subtype.
Conclusion
This study provides insights into the heterogeneity of care among Brazilian centers. Recognizing those diversities will support the design of effective strategies and collaboration nationwide.

Abstract: In this paper, we prepared Na–K co-doped Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) films by solution method. By optimizing the distribution of the K-doping (uniform or localized K-doping) in the precursor films, the efficiencies of CZTSSe solar cells were improved. The effect of the K-doping distribution on the properties of CZTSSe films and solar cells were investigated. Compared to the solar cells without K-doping, the uniform K-doping in the precursor film increased the solar cell efficiency from 10.4% to 11.7%. In comparison, the localized K-doping in the bottom and in the top of the precursor films yielded solar cells with efficiencies of 12.4% and 10.1%, respectively. It was determined that the K-doping distribution primarily had an influence on carrier recombination in the depletion regions of CZTSSe solar cells. Whereas k-doping at the top of the precursor film greatly enhances the carrier recombination in the depletion region, the bottom doping has the opposite effect. The reason could be that the variation of the K-doping distribution modified the crystallization of the CZTSSe films. As the result, the defect properties of the CZTSSe films were altered. Moreover, the effect of the bottom K-doping on the back contact properties of CZTSSe solar cells was investigated by impedance spectroscopy. Though the K-doping can reduce the back contact barrier of the solar cell, the back contact barrier still achieved the height of 228 meV. The results indicated that the back contact barrier would be an important limiting factor for the efficiency of CZTSSe solar cell.

Abstract: This work reports a facile two-step method of producing highly efficient ZnO photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting under solar light conditions and describes the role of surface oxygen vacancies (VO) in their enhanced PEC performance. The photoanode fabrication involves post-growth oxidation of a metallic Zn layer, which produces a nanostructured ZnO film consisting of ∼50 nm diameter nanorods containing a high concentration of VO defects. The PEC activity of the ZnO films is investigated by studying water oxidation in an aqueous electrolyte under simulated solar illumination. The relationship of PEC and charge transfer characteristics of the ZnO photoanodes with ionized surface VO defects is established using cathodoluminescence, X-ray photoemission, voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry. The combined results show that the photoanode fabricated in this work possesses a high surface density of ionized VO states that facilitate the effective transportation of holes for water oxidation. It is found that the photoanode exhibits an exceptional photocurrent density of 1.14 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE, being one of the best performances reported in the literature for ZnO-based photoelectrodes so far. Our results demonstrate a simple, low-cost method for fabricating highly efficient VO rich ZnO-based PEC photoanodes that is suitable for large scale production.

Abstract: Introduction
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is an autoimmune disorder that can present in primary or secondary forms. The literature looking at impact of baseline fluorescent antinuclear antibody (FANA) positivity on outcomes of AIHA patients is infrequent.
Objective
To study the impact of baseline FANA positivity in patients with primary AIHA.
Method
A prospective cohort study involving 29 consecutive primary AIHA patients presenting to the Haematology department from 2013 to 2015 was analysed. After recording baseline investigations including fluorescent ANA, all patients were treated as per the standard therapeutic protocols. Clinical remission, disease free survival, relapse, mortality were compared between the FANA positive and FANA Negative AIHA groups.
Results
Baseline FANA positivity was found in 17 patients (58.62%). Both the groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, Hemoglobin, LDH at presentation, number of lines of treatment needed and duration of follow up. Evan's syndrome was seen in six of FANA positive patients which was statistically significant (0 v/s 6, p = 0.023). FANA positive patients had significantly higher rates of relapse per patient month follow up (1.22 v/s 3.57, p = 0.023) and lower rates of complete response (83.33% v/s 35.29%, p = 0.0118) and relapse free survival at five years. Morbidity and mortality were numerically higher in FANA positive patients.
Conclusion
Baseline FANA positivity among AIHA patients was found to be associated with lower complete response rates and higher relapse rates with possible higher rates of morbidity. Presence of FANA will give us prognostic value and help us in deciding the treatment options.

Abstract: Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells have achieved a record efficiency of 26.81% in a front/back-contacted (FBC) configuration. Moreover, thanks to their advantageous high VOC and good infrared response, SHJ solar cells can be further combined with wide bandgap perovskite cells forming tandem devices to enable efficiencies well above 33%. In this study, we present strategies to realize high-efficiency SHJ solar cells through combined theoretical and experimental studies, starting from the optimization of Si-based thin-film layers to the implementation of electrodes with reduced indium and silver usage. Advanced opto-electrical simulations, which enable comprehensive theoretical understandings of the main physical mechanisms governing carriers’ collection and light management, provide clear pathways for device designs and experimental optimizations. We present the fabricated FBC-SHJ solar cells in both monofacial and bifacial configurations with the best efficiencies of 24.18% and 23.25%, respectively. We point out that to achieve optimum device performance, the compositional materials should be holistically optimized and evaluated as part of the contact stacks with adjacent layers. As an outlook beyond the classical FBC-SHJ solar cell architecture, we propose various novel SHJ-based solar cell architectures. Their potential performance was assessed and compared via rigorous opto-electrical simulations and a maximal efficiency of 27.60% was simulated for FBC-SHJ solar cells featuring localized contacts.

Abstract: The key to construct an efficient direct Z-scheme heterojunction lies in the selection of two semiconductors with matching Fermi energy levels, visible light response capability and the elaborately designed interface. Herein, a research method that theoretical calculation first and then experimental study was employed to develop an efficient direct Z-scheme V2O5/C3N5 photocatalyst for hydrogen production. First, the theoretical calculations on the V2O5 (110)/C3N5 (001) heterojunction suggested the large interface binding energy between these two components, their visible-light absorption properties and matching Fermi energy levels, and the charge difference density of V2O5/C3N5 allowing the migration path of photogenerated carriers in composite structure, which satisfies the requirements for constructing a direct Z-scheme. Then, the V2O5/C3N5 heterojunction was experimentally constructed by calcining the mixture of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and ammonium metavanadate, which Z-scheme charge transfer path was further verified by free radical trapping and in situ irradiated XPS analyses. We also found that N–O bonding was formed between C3N5 and V2O5, which could provide a favorable interface for facilitating the charge transfer within the heterojunction. The optimal V2O5/C3N5-3.7 heterojunction exhibited a H2 yield of 329.9 μmol/h under the visible light irradiation, 19.8 times that of single C3N5, and showed an apparent quantum efficiency of 7.21% at 420 nm. The high charge separation of the V2O5/C3N5 heterojunction is revealed to be mainly responsible for the enhancement in its photocatalytic activity. This work sheds light on the research method that consists of theoretical design first and then experimental study for constructing high-efficiency direct Z-scheme heterojunctions.

Abstract: SiNx and SiOxNy layers deposited by the PECVD method are commonly used in silicon solar cells for their excellent thin film properties. In this study, we perform an experimental analysis of the optical, chemical and electrical properties of these films prepared under different process conditions. The C–V measurements for the interface analysis reveal that SiOxNy layers for any refractive index have lower interface state density and fixed charge density than SiNx layers. Additionally, our calculations on the FTIR spectra indicate that SiNx, when compared with SiOxNy, has a significantly higher hydrogen amount which is important in reducing the interface traps. Furthermore, we explain the passivation results obtained from PCD measurement for single SiNx, single SiOxNy and their stack layers on p-type and n-type Si wafers by C–V and FTIR measurements. Our results suggest that depositing a very thin SiOxNy having low Dit beneath SiNx having high Qf and H amount provides superior passivation on p and n-type Si wafers, which is improved further by a subsequent fast-firing process.

Abstract: Renewable energy from a natural resource is currently significant awareness and is being discussed by researchers worldwide to solve the energy crises. This work paves the way for developing efficient solar-to-thermal energy storage conversion based on the “Soft-rigid” structural formation mechanism of carbon aerogel. Here, low-cost wasted pomelo peels derived three-dimensional (3D) porous networked carbon aerogels (PCAs) as a support matrix for paraffin wax (PW) as organic phase change materials (PCM). Moreover, composite phase change materials (CPCMs) show ultralow density, excellent thermal stability, enhanced thermal and electrical conductivities, outstanding shape stability, and leakage-proof ability. The impregnation loading ratio of PW-based CPCM3 reached 95.6%, ascribed to the unique “Soft-rigid” network structure of PCAs. More importantly, the change in the “Soft-rigid” structure endows PCA750 with a high compressive strength of 466 kPa at 60% compression rates. The obtained CPCM2 displayed a significant latent thermal storage capacity of 159.9 J/g and exhibited superior thermal reliability after 25 frequent heating/cooling cycles. The effective carbonization temperature of CPCM2 caused a significant increase in light absorbance; thus, high solar-to-thermal energy conversion efficiency (85.1%). This study provides new ways to convert waste low–value biomass materials into high-value renewable energy (solar-thermal-electricity) with long-term reusability via a simple and green technology. These are tremendous economic benefits in the thermal energy storage sectors.

Abstract: The problem of worldwide scarcity of clean water can be resolved efficiently by utilizing the significant heat localizing capability of the solar-driven interfacial evaporator with a nominal impact on the environment. A novel flexible, recyclable, hydrophilic photothermal composite membrane containing a blend of mesoporous Co3O4 nanorod and nanoporous nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon hollow spheres has been proposed. The composite membrane exhibits an enhanced broadband optical absorption which leads to a high interfacial evaporation rate (2.28 kg m−2 h−1) and a notable solar-to-steam generation efficiency (93%) under sunlight (900 W/m2) at 3.5 wt% NaCl salinity. The lower salt accumulation on the evaporation surface and the remarkable recyclability of the photothermal membrane under sunlight prove its practical usability in the desalination of seawater, water purification, salt production, and solar energy harvesting.

Abstract: Silicon (Si), with its indirect bandgap, is a non-ideal absorber. Thus, various strategies to boost silicon solar cells' efficiency, including advanced texturing, multilayer anti-reflecting coating, and rear reflectors are utilized. Dielectrics, deposited at elevated temperatures under a vacuum environment, are currently used to reduce the parasitic metal absorption at the rear. This work demonstrates that solution-based silica aerogel thin film is a flawless candidate for rear reflectors due to cost-effective deposition and near unity refractive index. We demonstrate that the morphology of aerogel thin films, spin-coated at room temperature under an ambient atmosphere, can be controlled by altering the solution concentration and spin-coating speed. We demonstrate ∼0.25 mA cm−2 short-circuit current density gain in the near-infrared region compared to cells with optimized indium zirconium oxide rear reflectors. Additionally, we show that incorporating aerogel in silicon heterojunction solar cells reduces the overall indium consumption required for TCO by more than 50%.

Abstract: In this study, the impact of various growth parameters, such as wafer temperature, device structures, and substrate misorientation, on the quality of InGaP epitaxial layers and solar cells grown in a planetary MOVPE reactor using TBP as a P source were investigated and optimized. Results showed that the carrier lifetime in unintentionally n-doped InGaP significantly decreased as the growth temperature increased from 560 to 590 °C. At temperatures above 600 °C, the growth of InGaP was unsuccessful due to extremely rough surface morphology. The study revealed that InGaP rear homojunction and rear heterojunction solar cells using n-type InGaP base layers displayed improved photo-carrier collection and performance compared to traditional front junction solar cells with p-type InGaP base layers. Notably, InGaP grown on GaAs (001) with a 5° miscut towards (111)A was found to have better quality, while InGaP grown on GaAs (001) with a 6° tilt towards (111)B had worse results in terms of carrier lifetime, PL intensity, and solar cell performance.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) spheroids generated in a three-dimensional (3D) culture system serve as a surrogate model that maintain stem cell characteristics since these mimic the in vivo behavior of cells and tissue more closely. Our study involved a detailed characterization of the spheroids generated in ultra-low attachment flasks. The spheroids were evaluated and compared for their morphology, structural integrity, viability, proliferation, biocomponents, stem cell phenotype and differentiation abilities with monolayer culture derived cells (2D culture). The in-vivo therapeutic efficacy of DPSCs derived from 2D and 3D culture was also assessed by transplanting them in an animal model of the critical-sized calvarial defect. DPSCs formed compact and well-organized multicellular spheroids when cultured in ultra-low attachment condition with superior stemness, differentiation, and regenerative abilities than monolayer cells. They maintained lower proliferative state and showed marked difference in the cellular biocomponents such as lipid, amide and nucleic acid between DPSCs from 2D and 3D cultures. The scaffold-free 3D culture efficiently preserves DPSCs intrinsic properties and functionality by maintaining them in the state close to the native tissues. The scaffold free 3D culture methods allow easy collection of a large number of multicellular spheroids of DPSCs and therefore, this can be adopted as a feasible and efficient method of generating robust spheroids for various in-vitro and in-vivo therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Luminescence imaging is a fast and non-destructive method to spatially resolve non-uniform electrical properties of solar cells. The spatial resolution of these images determines the smallest identifiable features. The higher the spatial resolution of an image, the better the capability to detect small defects. However, high-resolution cameras with high near-infrared light sensitivity that are suited to luminescence imaging of crystalline silicon are often expensive. In this study, we present a method, based on deep learning, that enhances the spatial resolution of luminescence images computationally with minimal cost. We also demonstrate the ability to overcome noise which is inevitable in any imaging system. This approach provides a simple and promising path toward reducing the cost of luminescence imaging systems and enhancing the capability of existing systems.

Abstract: The research community is giving a great deal of attention to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to the rapid increase in their power conservation efficiency (PCE), which has reached 25.7% in a relatively short period of time. Nevertheless, the hazardous nature of (Pb) based perovskites, which are the most prevalent, has been a significant hindrance to its commercial viability. Cations with similar properties, including Ge2+ and Sn2+, have been studied due to their similar oxidation states to Pb2+. Earlier research has shown that the outcome of the degradation of γ-CsSnI3 is Cs2SnI6, as the Sn2+ ion experiences an oxidation process and transforms into Sn4+. In this study, a numerical evaluation was conducted using the SCAPS-1D program with the aim of improving the stability and performance of a device that has already been demonstrated experimentally (ITO/NiOx/γ-CsSnI3/PCBM/Al). First, we have chosen a p-n junction (γ-CsSnI3-Cs2SnI6) rather than a classical p-n junction (γ-CsSnI3-PCBM). The n-type Cs2SnI6 is deposited on the p-type γ-CsSnI3 because it has the potential to prevent or slow down further degradation of the γ-CsSnI3, thus acting as a protective layer. Subsequently, the optimization of the γ-CsSnI3 layer was carried out by altering its thickness, reducing the number of defects (Nt), and controlling the concentration of acceptors (NA). We also optimized the concentration of defects at NiOx/γ-CsSnI3 and γ-CsSnI3/Cs2SnI6 interfaces. We also looked into how variables such as the ITO work function, shunt resistance, series resistance, and temperature influence the device's performance. Finally, we successfully obtained a stable lead-free solar device with an efficiency of 8.48% when measured at room temperature and 9.12% when measured at 280 K.

Abstract: Introduction
Data on the prevalence of clinically significant antigens (Rh, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, MNSs, Lewis, P and Lutheran) among the Indian donor population is sparse.
Objective
This prospective study was aimed at determining the prevalence of 21 clinically significant antigens for the first time in the South Indian donor population.
Method
A total of 672 regular O group blood donors were enrolled for Rh (C,c, E, e) and Kell (K) antigens typing. Of these, 188 donors were typed for other clinically significant antigens (k, Kpa, Kpb, Jka, Jkb, Fya, Fyb, M, N, S, s, P1, Lea, Leb, Lua and Lub).
Results
Antigen frequencies were expressed in percentages. In our study, R1R1 and rr were the most common phenotypes among D+ and D- donors, respectively. Among the Rh antigens, the e antigen was expressed by 97.5% and 100% of D+ and D- donors, respectively. The K antigen was found in only 0.15% of donors. In the Duffy and Kidd blood group system, Fy (a+b+) and Jk (a+b+) were the most frequent phenotypes, respectively. In the MNSs blood group system, M+N+ and S-s+ were the most common phenotypes reported. The Le (a-b+) was found to be the phenotype with the highest prevalence in the Lewis blood group system. The Lu (a-b+) was the only phenotype found in the Lutheran blood group system.
Conclusion
Knowledge regarding the prevalence of antigens in a given population is essential in developing cost-effective in-house panels and a rare donor registry comprising donors typed negative for a high-frequency antigen or a combination of common multiple antigens.

Abstract: Hierarchical metal mesh structures are fabricated for use as transparent conductive electrodes in electrochromic devices with large-band transmittance switching. Electrochromic materials (WO3 and Ta:NiO) are deposited by plasma sputtering on the metal mesh and characterized in a custom-made electrochemical setup allowing in-situ photo-spectrometer measurement. Both films deposited on metal mesh exhibit high transmittance, not only in the visible but also in the NIR spectrum. Electrochromic devices based on the WO3 cathode and Ta:NiO anode combined with the hierarchical metal mesh are fabricated. The resulting device achieves remarkable optical modulation in the full spectral range of solar radiation compared to conventional ITO-based devices. This study paves the way for development of hierarchical metal mesh-based electrochromic devices which offer high potential for energy savings through wide band modulation of solar heat gain in buildings in countries with warm and cold seasons.

Abstract: Carrier transportation and efficiency of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells are seriously inhibited due to heterojunction interface (HEI) recombination. Herein, we firstly propose a novel HEI doping strategy to address HEI recombination issue by introducing Cu-poor (& Al-rich) CuAlO2 (CAO). Our results indicate that interfacial elements interdiffusion took place between Cu from absorber and Al from CAO during selenization. Then, occupation of Al on the Cu site leads to the absorber shallow bulk inversion from p to n-type, and thereout constructs a desirable homogeneous field passivation (HFP) for HEI. It has not only a superior photo-induced charge carrier transportation function and penalizes the probability of electron-hole recombination but also leads to the superior carrier separation capacity via enlarging depletion region. In addition, CAO itself can bring about a chemical passivation effect owing to its high resistivity. As a result, synergistic passivation effect combining common chemical passivation with novel HFP was realized. Finally, we achieved 9.34% efficiency kesterite device involving chemical and field passivation effects simultaneously despite the relatively not top efficiency. In this regard, HEI doping engineering induced with characteristic Cu-poor (& Al-rich) material for absorber shallow bulk inversion and appreciable passivation effect achieved here shine a new light on the development of kesterite device.

Abstract: To reap in the full benefit of high-efficiency solar cells and modules, the quality of the polymer encapsulant and backsheet (BS) materials is essential. Recent field studies show that early degrading backsheets cause safety issues and inverter shutdowns, resulting in yield losses. The dynamic development of degradation is important but is rarely studied because of the lack of proper datasets with meaningful and sufficient data. We studied inverter data of solar panels with a combined capacity of about 1 MWp for more than nine years including ground impedance (GI), and we labelled BS-types using our in-house identification method. Every inverter was connected to modules with exclusively a single BS-type, namely three-multilayer BSs denoted by their outer air layer: PA (polyamide), FC (fluorinated coating), and PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride). We present, for the first time, an analysis of the degradation dynamics of GI, using a trained Gaussian Process Regression model. Using this model, we derived key degradation parameters, namely GI loss rates and time points for the onset of degradation. We found that PVDF BSs are associated with very low GI loss rates, while loss rates for PA are threefold higher with an onset at 6.6 year of operation for PA. FC BS-related loss rates were humidity dependent and two times higher those of PA; the onset was determined at 4.9 year of operation.

Abstract: Co-extruded backsheets based on polypropylene (PP) are an interesting alternative to laminated backsheets based on polyester films (PET). Backsheet cracking has become a frequent aging induced failure mode in the last years, causing not only safety issues but also reducing the lifetime of PV modules on the long term. In this work the crack susceptibility of four different backsheet types was investigated using solder bump coupon specimens: two co-extruded backsheets based on polyamide (PA) and PP, two laminated backsheet containing a PET core layer and polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) outer layers. The solder bump coupons were exposed to an accelerated stress test sequence of repeated exposure to UV light followed by thermal cycles (TC). Overall, the PP as well as the PVF-PET backsheet showed excellent stability and no susceptibility to material embrittlement or cracking. By comparison, the PA based backsheets showed next to significant discoloration also strong cracking after a few UV-TC test cycles. The PET-PVDF backsheet exhibited cracking after the same number of test cycles as the PA-based backsheets. Overall, the study confirms that co-extruded PP backsheets show great potential to be a valid replacement of standard PET based backsheets in PV modules.

Abstract: Structural stability, surface cleaning and wind speed effect, along with degradation behavior against sun exposure, dust deposition and water (rain) are important technical issues of daytime radiative cool coating for real-world application. Hence, we develop a three-layered coating consisting of an adhesive bottom layer (better stability), a middle layer of novel barium fluoride particle-based composite in PMMA polymer and a top protective cleanable PMMA layer for efficient daytime radiative cooling. Cooling performance is evaluated in terms of cooling flux and sub-ambient temperature drop. Performance degradation behavior of developed coating against sun exposure, water immersion and dust immersion is investigated. The effect of wind velocity on the radiative cooler performance is also evaluated experimentally. A temperature drop of nearly 3–5 °C is observed at the peak solar irradiance and a maximum temperature drop of approximately 7.2 °C is observed during afternoon hours. A maximum cooling power of 65 W/m2 is recorded experimentally in the afternoon. The negligible cooling performance degradation has been observed against sun, dust and water exposures, which confirms long-term sustainability. However, the significant effect of wind speed on cooling performance is observed for developed radiative coating (sub-ambient temperature drop is found to be inversely proportional to wind speed).

Abstract: A long operational lifetime is required for the use of solar cells in real-life photovoltaic applications. The optimization of operational lifetimes is achieved through understanding the inherent degradation phenomena in solar cells. In this study, graphene/Si Schottky-junction solar cells were produced, utilizing liquid-phase-exfoliated graphene as an active surface. The operational and interface stability of these solar cells over a period of 5 years in ambient conditions (following ISOS-D protocols: dark storage/shelf life) was examined, and the origin of their degradation was reported. It was found that the dominant degradation mechanism could be attributed to the degradation of silver contacts. This was indicated by a decrease in shunt resistance, an increase in the ideality factor (due to a higher carrier recombination), and a constant defect density in graphene films for up to 4 years. Measurements across the solar cell's active area during the 5-year period revealed neither significant spatial inhomogeneity, nor shunt channel defects.

Abstract: Introduction
Although still rare, pulmonary embolism (PE) in children has been increasing over the years. Data regarding this group of patients are still sparse, which contributes to the lack of standardized prophylaxis protocols and the misdiagnosis. This study aimed to determine the incidence of pediatric PE at a Brazilian tertiary hospital, describe clinical characteristics and identify possible risk factors. We also analyzed the diagnosis and management of PE.
Methods
This was a retrospective review of tertiary Brazilian single-center data of all pediatric patients (0 – 18 years) with acute PE, diagnosed radiologically, from September 2009 to May 2019.
Results
The incidence of PE was 3.3 cases per 10,000 hospitalized children. All the twenty-three cases had some risk factor identified and sixteen of them (69.5%) had more than one risk factor. The most important were central venous catheter (39.1%), malignancy (34.8%) and recent surgery (34.8%). Among the children with identifiable symptoms (69.5%), the most common was dyspnea (56.2%). Only one patient did not receive antithrombotic therapy because of the high bleeding risk and most patients (70.6%) were treated for 3 to 6 months. Among the nineteen patients alive at the end of the six-month follow-up, ten (52.6%) repeated the PE image control. Seven of them (70.0%) had complete or partial resolution of the thrombosis and none had worsening images.
Conclusion
Our lower incidence than that of the current literature may reflect underdiagnosis due to low suspicion of PE. At least one risk factor was identified in all patients, which emphasizes the importance of increasing awareness of high-risk children.

Abstract: Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) shows attractive potential in utilizing solar energy and easing the global greenhouse effect. However, the strong absorption of traditional silicon (Si) photovoltaic (PV) modules makes the high surface temperature and keeps the black appearance. For the current BIPVs, improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Si PV modules with aesthetic requirements remains a great challenge. Herein, we design a novel transparent-colored radiative cooling nanocomposite coating that can be applied to the cover glass of Si PV modules. The functional coating consists of the non-metallic nanoparticle (Si@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticle) for the structural coloration of PV modules and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as the matrix. The Si@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticle with Mie resonance selectively reflects visible light to generate a structural color. The PMMA exhibits high transmittance above the bandgap of the Si solar cell and good emittance in the mid-infrared region. The simulated results show that the colored PV modules with integrated coatings display a wide range of colors in the CIE−1931 color space and the PCE loss reduction of all the colored PV modules is less than 10%. Meanwhile, the solar transmittance above the Si bandgap T‾solar > 0.9 and the emittance in the atmospheric window ε‾IR > 0.95. The equilibrium temperature of Si PV modules with functional coatings is only 2∼3 K higher than the ideal minimum. This work provides an alternative and convenient method to design the structural colored PV module with radiative cooling for effectively balancing PV module color and PCE, promoting the development of BIPVs.

Abstract: The development of new functional materials plays a pivotal role in creating novel materials for devices such as displays or smart windows, offering new possibilities for indoor comfort and energy saving. Most devices only respond to a single external stimulus (electrical, light, thermal) missing on the potential of incorporating multiple responses. Herein, all-in-one thermo- and electrochromic hydrogels for dual responsive displays are presented. In these multifunctional materials, different viologens and thermoresponsive polymers (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) or poly(N-vinylcaprolactam)) were incorporated simultaneously into hydrogels. By applying these hydrogels on simple sandwich type FTO based devices, it was possible to create single layered dual responsive devices. These devices could change their opacity and color due to their thermochromic (TC) and electrochromic (EC) properties, being able to combine both changes at the same time. The devices showed high optical contrasts, from their almost fully transparent bleached state to their TC and EC states (<5% and ≈70% transmittance at 600 nm, respectively). All phase changes were proven to be reversible by cycling between the bleached, TC, EC and dual TEC states for consecutive times. Therefore, these hydrogels can offer new simple smart window or display designs.

Abstract: Technical barriers including the poor thermal conductivity, low energy conversion efficiency, and melting leakage hindered the large-scale storage of waste heat and solar energy by the shape-stable phase change materials (ss-PCMs). To address the challenges mentioned above, a high-performance ss-PCM is fabricated using the thermal conducive 3D interconnected scaffold that derived from a biomimetically grown yeast-templated zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) precursor. After carbonization, the morphology and porosity-controlled bio-inspired derived ZIF-8@yeast porous carbon (DYC) exhibited unique porous skeleton, which allowing high capillary adsorption and effective chemical interaction for mannitol storage. The obtained DYC/mannitol ss-PCM exhibited high thermal conductivity (1.17 W/mK), high relative enthalpy efficiency (98.96%), and outstanding stability and recyclability. Meanwhile, compared with the pure mannitol, the supercooling degree of the novel DYC/mannitol was decreased by 18.42%. All findings suggested that the ss-PCM by yeast-templated MOFs derived hierarchical porous carbon has good application prospects in high-density energy storage.

Abstract: Silicon heterojunction technology (HJT) is expected to gain a significant market share in the near future. For HJT to deliver a low levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), it needs to have a high initial efficiency and degrade less than 0.5% relative per year. This work investigates damp heat-induced failure modes in silicon HJT glass-backsheet modules. Four unique failure modes are identified after damp heat (DH) testing: point failure (Type-1); failure around the interconnected regions of the busbars and ribbon wires (Type-2); failure between the busbars (Type-3); and failure at/on the interconnected regions of busbars and ribbon wires (Type-4). The Type-1 failure mode is likely caused by a chemical reaction between surface contaminants (introduced to the cells during handling or characterization before encapsulation) and moisture that increase charge carrier recombination and lead to a loss in maximum power (Pmax) of up to 40%rel in this study. Type-2 and Type-3 failure modes cause Pmax losses of ∼5%rel and 50%rel, respectively, in this study and can appear due to exposure to soldering flux used for connecting the ribbon wires and busbars. Finally, the Type-4 failure mode causes a Pmax loss of ∼16%rel in this study after the DH test. The evidence suggests that this failure mode is likely due to the interaction of acetic acid, generated from a reaction between the encapsulation material and moisture, ribbon wires, and silver paste (busbars), resulting in recombination loss. We believe these failure modes must be well understood and mitigated at preferably the solar cell level to ensure that HJT can meet its LCOE potential.

Abstract: Thermal fatigue of soldered interconnections of silicon solar cells is considered one of the key failure modes in photovoltaic (PV) modules. Due to differences in thermal expansion coefficients of the used materials, cracks and disconnected wiring can occur, causing a local increase of resistance. This can lead to hot spots and early failure of a panel. In this research, we develop eddy current soldering as a non-contact soldering technique for tabbing the ribbon of PV cells under a layer of glass. The performance of eddy current soldering was studied in detail by changing an induction coil distance to the treated sample from 2 to 4 mm and varying exposure time. An IR camera monitored temperature profiles at the soldering zone, and I–V curves of samples were extracted to validate the soldering technique and the efficiency of the tabbing process. Electroluminescence imaging was deployed to monitor cracking after the soldering process; scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) were used to investigate the microstructure and cracking within the solder joint and silicon. The results showed that the shortest exposure times at a 2 mm heating distance caused higher risks for cracks in silicon. The intermediate exposures at a 3 mm heating distance increased the likelihood of cracking in the solder joint. For the longest heating times at a distance of 4 mm, the solder joint appeared crack free, although, in some areas, poor wetting of solder was observed. The performance of eddy current soldering under a layer of glass was compared to manually soldered samples. Based on the I–V curves, all samples were functional, and differences between exposure times and manually soldered samples were not evident. Thus, only electrical verification of the solder quality was insufficient. Due to the study, it was concluded that the proper solder interconnections through glass could be made by using the eddy current soldering process and a sufficient exposure time to avoid cracking within the solder joint configuration and silicon.

Abstract: Weight reduction by omitting the use of bulky glass in c-Si photovoltaic (PV) modules is an important consideration of module development for vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (VIPV). Various approaches to achieve lightweight modules are proposed, yet there are many concerns regarding the reliability of such modules compared to standard glass-glass or glass-backsheet configurations. In this work, we investigate the thermo-mechanical behavior of LW modules with a multiwire design specifically aiming to VIPV applications. The developed modules consist of a commercially available carbon-fiber reinforced polypropylene backsheet and are compared to glass-fiber reinforced polypropylene backsheet modules. To enhance the thermo-mechanical reliability, polymer encapsulant and interconnection foil are substituted by glass-fiber reinforced composite encapsulant with the carbon-fiber reinforced polypropylene backsheet, thereby leading to ∼2.9% fill factor (FF) decrease with a limited degradation after 200 thermal cycles. A failure mechanism analysis using electroluminescence and X-ray-based micro-tomography is carried out after thermal cycling tests, clearly demonstrating that thermal stresses introduce deformation of wire interconnects. A modified high-temperature thermal cycling test (- 40 to 110 °C, 3.5 h) is implemented to observe the fast degradation of interconnects in compliance with VIPV conditions. The resulting fatigue stresses account for wire breakage in-between cells in the glass-fiber reinforced polypropylene module, while this effect is less pronounced in the carbon-fiber reinforced polypropylene backsheet module, indicating better thermo-mechanical reliability of the carbon-fiber reinforced polypropylene backsheet module. Herein, the current results could provide guidelines for lightweight PV module design (with a weight of 4.8 kg/m2) in the thermo-mechanical aspect. This research sheds light on the potential of lightweight modules specifically for VIPV applications.

Abstract: To increase the bankability of photovoltaics (PV), a more accurate prediction of the lifetime and degradation-rate of PV modules is required. In past studies, average degradation rates for different technologies have been derived from field data. However, in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) based PV, localized shunts are commonly found in modules coming out of the factory. Although the impact of such localized defects on initial module performance has been studied in the past, their evolution and impact on module performance upon aging remain mostly unknown. In this paper, it is demonstrated that exposure of CIGS devices to elevated temperatures and humidity can result in the partial or complete recovery of localized ohmic shunts. This was observed for three types of shunting defects, each on a different CIGS device characterized before and after damp heat exposure. In each device, the reduction in shunting after damp heat could be observed in illuminated lock-in thermography, photoluminescence and current-voltage measurements. For two of the devices, the positive effect of shunt reduction was counteracted by other degradation mechanisms, such as increase in series resistance of TCO or back contact, while a 4% absolute efficiency increase was observed in the third device. Our data suggests that the shunting is mainly reduced due to oxidation of the materials initially forming the shunting path. The combined effects of moisture degradation and shunt reduction may limit detectability of moisture ingress in electrical performance data. These results illustrate the added value of regular visual inspection and luminescence in quality control.

Abstract: As an electrochromic material, NiO has a distinct color conversion, but its single color variation limits its application. In this study, NiO-based multi-color electrochromic films were prepared by using simple hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. The composite electrochromic film can achieve a variety of color changes in yellow, green, blue and dark brown. NiO provides the substrate for organic copolymers, bringing large contact areas and ion channels, while the copolymerization and recombination of aniline-o-toluidine copolymers achieve a series of rich color changes. The results show that five color changes from colorless to dark brown can be achieved between −1 and 1.5 V. By controlling the applied voltage and the transition between the redox states of the film, the composite film is yellow at 0.2 V, green at 0.5 V, blue at 0.8 V, and dark brown at 1.5 V. The composite film has unprecedented stability. The improvement of cyclic stability is attributed to the uniform and dense coating of nickel oxide on the surface after being combined with copolymer. This encapsulation form will affect the ions entering the deep layer of NiO, reduce the erosion of NiO, and improve the cycling stability of NiO to a certain extent. This is fully demonstrated by the cyclic stability test. After 1000 cycles, the composite film can still show excellent optical modulation range. This study provides reference for the development of NiO multi-color electrochromic materials.

Abstract: Hybrid electrochromic (EC) devices present an interesting configuration in which the advantage of both solid-state and liquid-based devices can be combined in order to optimize the device performances. In this configuration, a solid-state EC material is combined with a redox couple dissolved in the electrolyte. The redox electrolyte offers an unlimited charge capacity, thus allowing to fully exploit the electrochromic properties of the EC material. Here, we present a thiolate/disulphide (T−/T2) redox couple as a new redox shuttle for EC devices. In order to transfer the advantages of the redox couple to a solid state device, it was combined with a fully transparent thermally curable vinyl-acetate polymer. The obtained EC device was compared with that based on I−/I3− showing higher transparency in the visible region of the solar spectrum and higher coloration efficiency. Most interestingly, the device based on T−/T2 shows a slower self-bleaching process and it only loses 30% of its coloration after 1 h at open circuit. Such characteristic represents a great advantage for smart windows applications since it is not necessary to apply potential to maintain the device coloration, thus allowing a great energy saving.

Abstract: This work demonstrates the reduction of cutting-induced losses on tunnel-oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) shingle solar cells via edge passivation using high-throughput layer deposition. TOPCon shingle solar cells with a size of 26.46 mm × 158.75 mm are separated from industrial full-square TOPCon host cells either by laser scribing and mechanical cleaving (LSMC) from the emitter-free rear side or by thermal laser separation (TLS) from the front side. TLS yields up to 0.2%abs more efficient shingle cells directly after singulation in comparison to shingle cells that have been separated by LSMC. Passivated edge technology (PET) is applied by depositing aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layers using two different tools: thermal atomic layer deposition (T-ALD) in a lab-scale tool with a throughput of tens of shingle cells per hour and a high-throughput plasma-enhanced ALD (PE-ALD) prototype tool with a throughput of about 60,000 shingle cells per hour. The energy conversion efficiency of the edge-passivated shingle cells after T-ALD Al2O3 PET is found to be 0.4%abs higher than directly after separation. This gain is the same regardless of whether LSMC or TLS is used for cell separation. For PE-ALD Al2O3 and TLS, a gain of 0.5%abs is measured after PET. Stringing tests with electrically conductive adhesive so far indicate that Al2O3 layers do not negatively affect the resistance of cell to cell interconnections. Thus, low-damage cell cutting in combination with high-throughput Al2O3 layer deposition for edge passivation is a very promising approach to maintain high efficiency for industrial TOPCon solar cells in shingled modules.

Abstract: Several works have been published recently regarding firing stability of passivating contacts featuring P-doped polysilicon on an interfacial oxide (poly-Si/SiOx). Therein, a degradation was reported if the (n) poly-Si/SiOx structure was capped by a dielectric passivation layer during firing due to creation of additional defects in the interfacial oxide. In part A of this study it is shown, that P-doped (n) poly-Si/SiOx structures capped by a SiNy or SiNy/AlOz stack only degrade during firing at moderate temperatures if they previously have been annealed below the optimum annealing temperature Topt. It was found that this degradation is stronger the colder the annealing temperature was below Topt. In part B of this study it is shown, that at excess firing temperatures also samples annealed at or above Topt degrade. Again, this degradation depends on the initial annealing temperature in a similar way that the degradation is stronger the colder the annealing temperature was below Topt. Furthermore, a saturation of the measured surface recombination density was observed for set firing temperatures above 900°C, which points to a saturation of the underlying defect creation mechanism in the interfacial oxide.

Abstract: Effects of temperature-dependent ion migration on power reduction of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under illumination were investigated at temperatures between 15 °C and 45 °C. Mobile-ion concentrations increased with temperature and the power reduction under illumination became faster at high temperatures due to an increase in the number of slow mobile ions and a decrease in the number of fast mobile ions, which was confirmed through ion migration currents. This indicates formation of deep-level defects with low mobility from the fast mobile ions (halide vacancies). Moreover, the transient power responses during maximum-power-point tracking (MPPT) became slower at high temperatures upon illumination, reflecting an increase in the number of slow mobile ions. Furthermore, the light–dark cycling test clarified that the energy yield during 8 h of illumination was reduced by ∼10 rel% per light–dark cycle at 45 °C, which was accompanied by an increase in the concentration of, particularly slow, mobile ions. These results indicate that transient ion-migration analysis for evaluating the concentration of mobile ions (mobile defects) can be effective in understanding the mobile-ion-induced degradation of PSCs.

Abstract: The switching performance of W/VO2 nanoparticles in thermochromic glass laminates was investigated. W/VO2 powder was prepared, and displayed a phase transition temperature and switching enthalpy of 20.9 °C and 37.5 ± 0.2 J g−1, respectively. Using wet bead milling, the particle size was reduced from 24 ± 2 μm to 120 ± 10 nm. In the same process, the switching enthalpy decreased to 18.2 ± 0.6 J g−1 due to partial loss of crystallinity. The kinetics of the structural phase transition were studied using Friedman's differential isoconversional method. This demonstrated that the activation energy |Eα| was inversely proportional to the square of the difference between the material's temperature and the critical switching temperature T0, pointing out that nucleation kinetics were determining the rate. Furthermore, |Eα| decreased upon milling, and kinetic asymmetry was induced. The milled nanoparticles were compounded with PVB to produce thermochromic films, which were applied for laminating glass plates. The impact of nanoparticle size and concentration on the resulting optical properties of the laminate, viz. solar transmission and solar modulation, was studied in detail. The highest solar modulation obtained was 9.4%. The results obtained in this study are of direct importance for the application in smart windows, showing that (i) the W/VO2 particle size needs to be ≤ 100 nm to avoid excessive haze, (ii) both powder production and bead milling require further process optimization to minimize functional performance losses, and (iii) T0 should be set about 3 °C lower to ensure a sufficiently fast switch at the temperature of choice.

Abstract: Light- and elevated Temperature-induced Degradation (LeTID) remains a challenge for the long-term stability of silicon-based solar cells. Despite numerous publications and studies on the subject, only a link with the hydrogen concentration in the silicon bulk has been established. However, the question remains as to how exactly hydrogen interacts with the defect or even forms part of it. In this study, highly sensitive resistivity measurements and photoluminescence/ photoconductance decay measurements are used to establish a precise correlation between the dominant hydrogen species (H2 and GaH) and the evolving defect concentration in fired Ga-doped silicon coated with an hydrogen-rich amorphous silicon nitride (SiNx:H). The correlation appears to be linear in both species over the range investigated but the data imply that the defect concentration is proportional to H2. An investigation of the behavior of GaH during typical degradation conditions confirms that GaH pairs are hydrogen sinks and therefore do not contribute to the formation of LeTID defects. We therefore expect the hydrogen dimer to act as a precursor for LeTID. In addition, the indiffusion of H during the firing step from a SiNx:H layer was investigated and a strong dependence on the peak temperature was found, whereas a weaker dependence on the cooling rate was observed.

Abstract: Concentration photovoltaics are used to achieve solar energy focusing on small-area solar cells, thus obtaining a high efficiency at a reasonable cost. An array of gold plasmonic concentrator cells is proposed here, which can nano-focus the solar radiation down to 60 nm spot size. It works over the entire solar energy bandwidth up to 2400 nm wavelength, which is extended beyond the conventional solar cells known maximum operating wavelength of 1800 nm. The concentrator consists of a coaxial waveguide with a tapered section that can plasmonically nano-focus solar radiation, followed by a straight waveguide section to propagate focused light along a graphene metamaterial for optical absorption. The metamaterial is integrated within the 60 nm gap of the straight waveguide section. The metamaterial consists of 10 concentric graphene shell layers, which are cross-connected by 5 horizontal graphene annuli. The concentrator and metamaterial design maximizes the solar optical absorption efficiency within the graphene metamaterial. The graphene optical absorption is enhanced up to 27 times with an almost flat response covering most of the solar bandwidth. The plasmonic absorption within the gold surfaces of the structure is found to be reasonable. The enhanced optical absorption of the weak solar radiation received within the extended band (1800–2400 nm) can reach up to 50%. The concentrator device is polarization insensitive with a 120o field-of-view. The enhanced optical power absorption in graphene metamaterial could be used in photovoltaic energy harvesting applications.

Abstract: Molten salts are utilized in a wide range of applications including nuclear, fuel cells, Carnot batteries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). In order to enhance the profitability of next-generation CSP plants, increasing their efficiency is imperative. Ternary carbonate salts are capable of elevating the maximum CSP operating temperature, which results in improved power generation efficiency. However, higher temperatures lead to accelerated corrosion and more severe conditions for structural materials. In this study, nanosecond laser micromachining is investigated as a potential corrosion mitigation technique for molten carbonate salts in dynamic conditions. SS310 samples with laser-induced surface textures are subjected to the flow of molten Li2CO3–K2CO3–Na2CO3 at 600 °C for a period of 600 h. Laser treatment significantly impedes corrosion in SS310, as untreated samples display pitting and scaling, while minimal surface changes are noted on treated samples. Cross-sectional analysis of the samples reveals considerable peeling in the untreated samples and a 45% increase in the corrosion rate compared to the treated samples. The concentrations of Cr and Mg in the salt (determined through ICP analysis) are found to be twofold and fourfold higher than those in treated samples. Laser treatment renders Cr and Mg less accessible to the salt ions, particularly Li, which results in improved corrosion resistance.

Abstract: The hole transport material (HTM)-free carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) are widely recognized as competitive candidates towards practical applications. However, the poor mechanical connection at perovskite/carbon interface and the low light transmittance of flexible substrates limit the fabrication of high-efficiency flexible HTM-free C-PSCs. In this paper, we develop flexible HTM-free C-PSCs with enhanced flexibility and light utilization by implanting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into perovskite film and carbon electrode to boost the connection at perovskite/carbon interface as well as by coating a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) antireflection layer to enhance light utilization of the polyethylene naphthalate/indium tin oxide (PEN/ITO) substrates. The CNTs are proven to not only enhance the flexibility of the devices, but also facilitate charge extraction and transfer at perovskite/carbon interface. The average transmittance of the PEN/ITO substrates increase by 3.63% after the incorporation of PMMA antireflection layer. As a result, the flexible HTM-free C-PSC with an architecture of PMMA/PEN/ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/carbon presents a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.44%, which is the highest PCE for flexible HTM-free C-PSC devices. Moreover, this flexible PSC retains more than 84% of the original PCE after bending 1000 cycles at 7 mm bending radius attributed to the enhanced connection at the perovskite/carbon interface.

Abstract: We present SERIS’ biPoly™ technology platform on large-area (M2), n-type rear-junction silicon solar cells featuring selective poly-Si/SiOx based passivated contacts on the front side and full-area poly-Si/SiOx contacts on the rear. The selective poly-Si ‘fingers’ are formed using an industrial ink-jet masking process followed by wet-chemical etching. The metal contacts are formed by an industrial screen-printing process using high-temperature fire-though metal pastes. We obtain excellent passivation on the front and rear surfaces, resulting in iVoc values between 720 mV and 730 mV on unmetallized solar cells. After high-temperature metallization, we achieve 22% efficiency on solar cells with selective poly-Si fingers on the front. We further develop the model for biPoly™ solar cells and with the help of a detailed loss analysis and simulations, identify the various loss components to identify the device modifications required for efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Hole transporting materials (HTMs) are vital in efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To improve the performance of PSCs, it is of great significance to design and optimize HTMs. Here, spiro-biOMe, an analogue of spiro-OMeTAD featuring one additional meta-methoxy group on each diarylamine moiety, is reported. The structure of this new HTM has been further elaborated to give another analogue, spiro-cyclOMe, where an alkyl chain links the two adjacent O atoms. The effect of chemical structure on molecular and photovoltaic properties has been studied. It was found that the hole mobility and thermal stability were noticeably increased in the case of spiro-cyclOMe. When used in the PSC device (used perovskite: Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3), spiro-cyclOMe delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 23%, which is higher than spiro-biOMe (PCE = 20.19%) and spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 22.61%). A device employing spiro-cyclOMe, with an active area of 0.56 cm2, exhibited a PCE of 21.64%. More importantly, PSCs employing spiro-cyclOMe as HTM also showed better stability than those employing spiro-OMeTAD.

Abstract: Insulin resistance is the leading cause of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and dysfunctional insulin receptor signaling is a major manifestation of this insulin resistance. In T2D, the corresponding insulin receptor levels are aberrantly down-regulated, which is one of the major factors underlying obesity-induced insulin resistance in adipose tissue. However, the precise mechanism of insulin receptor impairment in obese individuals remains unclear. In the current study, we established that immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine-rich repeat (Islr) is highly expressed in adipocytes of mice fed a high-fat diet. We further demonstrated that Islr mediates the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of insulin receptor alpha (Insrα) by specifically interacting with proteasome subunit alpha type 4 (Psma4). Islr knockout increased the corresponding Insrα subunit levels and enhanced insulin sensitivity in adipocytes, ultimately improving systemic metabolism. Further, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Islr expression in the white adipose tissue of obese mice increased insulin sensitivity. Overall, Islr regulates insulin sensitivity by interacting with Psma4 to control the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of Insrα in obese mice, indicating that Islr may be a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating insulin resistance.

Abstract: Introduction
Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) leads to dismal outcomes. This study aimed to identify high-risk patients and explore the effects of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in a high CMV-seropositive population.
Methods
The study involved a single-center retrospective cohort in Thailand, analyzing clinical risk factors and CMV-mediated immune responses, correlated with transplant outcomes in AML patients.
Results
Eighty-five patients with AML in complete remission (CR) undergoing HLA-matched myeloablative allo-SCT between 2011 and February 2021 were enrolled. The relapse rate was 27.1% with the median time of 7 months after transplantation. The 3-year relapse-free-survival (RFS) and overall-survival (OS) were 72.2% and 80.8%, respectively. The disease status (>CR1) and absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) were independently significant adverse prognostic factors of RFS and OS. Ninety-two percent of recipient-donor pairs were both CMV seropositive. The CMV reactivation occurred in 54.1% of the patients. The clinically significant CMV infection rate was 49.4%. No CMV syndrome/disease or CMV-related mortality occurred. One-year cumulative incidence of relapse among CMV-reactivation and non-reactivation groups were 14.3% and 25.6%, respectively, without a statistically significant difference. Transplantation-related mortality was 11.1%.
Conclusions
The transplantation beyond CR1 and absence of cGVHD are powerful prognostic factors associated with inferior RFS and OS. In a high CMV prevalence country, there appears to be no impact of CMV reactivation on relapse in AML patients undergoing an allo-SCT.

Abstract: With the increasing use of building-integrated photovoltaic technology, it has become necessary for solar panels to blend in with their surroundings. Diffractive nanostructures can be used to reduce optical losses and create colorful solar cells. To make colors on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin-film solar cells, we fabricated diffractive nanostructures by using nanoscale imprinting and transfer lithography methods. And we investigated how the material types and pattern shapes of the nanostructures influence the optical properties of solar cells, such as the short-circuit current density (JSC), coordination of color appearance, and color quality. We used two types of pillars and grating nanostructures of SiO2 and TiO2 layers on CIGS thin-film solar cells to produce various colors. The SiO2 demonstrated an increase in JSC without significant loss of color quality compared to TiO2. By utilizing a hexagonally arrayed pillar pattern, colors are observed at various angles on an axis different from the incident light, unlike colors observed only at a single angle in the grating structure. The nanoimprinting lithography process allowed us to produce high-quality nanostructures on both rigid glass and flexible stainless-steel substrates.

Abstract: A combination of the two techniques, one that employs seed crystal strips and the other that makes use of graphite soft felts have been proposed and studied to improve the casting process of monocrystalline Si (mono-Si) ingots. The evolution of the melting process of Si seed crystals and the growth of edge Si muliticrystals during the cast of mono-Si ingot has been investigated in detail. The results of the study indicated that these two changes increased the proportion of full mono-Si wafers substantially and led to a considerable reduction in the average dislocation ratio of edge Si bricks based on cast mono-Si ingot. Solar cell devices fabricated based on cast mono-Si ingot with the above two improvement measures exhibited enhancement in their overall photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) by 0.29% and 0.64% (absolute value), in comparison to the solar cells based on mono-Si ingot that was cast using only the seed crystal strips and the conventional ingot, respectively. Therefore, the study provides sufficient evidence that utilization of seed crystal strips and graphite soft felts in combination with each other as supplementary measures to the casting process of mono-Si ingot can be scaled up to be used in the photovoltaic production line for the development of solar cells with higher performance.

Abstract: Introduction
The availability of a clinical decision algorithm for diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may greatly contribute to the diagnosis of CLL, particularly in cases with ambiguous immunophenotypes. Herein we propose a novel differential diagnosis algorithm for the CLL diagnosis using immunophenotyping with flow cytometry.
Methods
The hierarchical logistic regression model (Backward LR) was used to build a predictive algorithm for the diagnosis of CLL, differentiated from other lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs).
Results
A total of 302 patients, of whom 220 (72.8%) had CLL and 82 (27.2%), B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders other than CLL, were included in the study. The Backward LR model comprised the variables CD5, CD43, CD81, ROR1, CD23, CD79b, FMC7, sIg and CD200 in the model development process. The weak expression of CD81 and increased intensity of expression in markers CD5, CD23 and CD200 increased the probability of CLL diagnosis, (p < 0.05). The odd ratio for CD5, C23, CD200 and CD81 was 1.088 (1.050 - 1.126), 1.044 (1.012 - 1.077), 1.039 (1.007 - 1.072) and 0.946 (0.921 - 0.970) [95% C.I.], respectively. Our model provided a novel diagnostic algorithm with 95.27% of sensitivity and 91.46% of specificity. The model prediction for 97.3% (214) of 220 patients diagnosed with CLL, was CLL and for 91.5% (75) of 82 patients diagnosed with an LPD other than CLL, was others. The cases were correctly classified as CLL and others with a 95.7% correctness rate.
Conclusions
Our model highlighting 4 markers (CD81, CD5, CD23 and CD200) provided high sensitivity and specificity in the CLL diagnosis and in distinguishing of CLL among other LPDs.

Abstract: Polar dielectric embedded polymer-based radiative cooling (RCPDP) materials are more attractive since they can not only achieve daytime radiative cooling but also be fabricated on a large scale at a low cost. In this paper, we propose a screening method for dielectric particles with high absorption capacity in the solar spectrum based on electronic energy band structures. We derive the dielectric function of dielectric particles using the four-parameter semi-quantum (FPSQ) model and determine the optical properties of the dielectric particles through the FDTD simulation and Mie theory. Then, we obtain the electromagnetic wave attenuation depth of the hybrid material accounting for the derived effective complex refractive index. Finally, the proposed method is validated with experiments. The results show that the calculated emissivity of the hybrid material is in high agreement with the measurement. Furthermore, α-SiO2 is the most suitable dielectric particle for RCPDP materials among the selected dielectric particles of α-SiO2, α-Al2O3, TiO2, and SiC. This work provides a theoretical explanation for the high performance of RCPDP materials and a theoretical guide for the selection of substrates for achieving radiative cooling.

Abstract: Introduction
Sickle cell anemia is a monogenic disorder caused by a mutation in the β-hemoglobin gene, resulting in sickle hemoglobin that can polymerize. Presentation and clinical course have significant inter-individual variability and classifying these patients for severity is a challenge.
Methods
We applied hierarchical clusters with 10 routine laboratory tests to understand if this grouping could be associated with clinical manifestations. We included 145 adult homozygous patients (SS) at an outpatient clinic in a retrospective study.
Results
We found five clusters by counting those that had been differentiated by unconjugated bilirubin, reticulocytes, LDH, leukocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes. When comparing groups to clinical findings, the clusters were different only for liver abnormality. Cluster 3 had the lower median of reticulocytes, LDH, leukocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes and a higher percentage of patients under treatment. Clusters 4 and 5 had higher frequencies of liver impairment and higher medians of reticulocytes, LDH, leukocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes. Hemolysis and inflammation seemed to influence the grouping.
Conclusion
In our study, cluster analysis showed five groups that exhibited different degrees of inflammation and hemolysis. When comparing clinical data, the result was different only for the criteria of liver abnormality.

Abstract: The comprehensive understanding of the Ohmic contact mechanism on the front metalization is highly desirable for further improvement of crystalline silicon solar cells performance. However, there are still controversial views about current transport paths between silver electrode and silicon emitter. To clarify this significant issue, we applied the selective acid etching (AE) process and the method of mechanical stripping process to prepare proper samples for direct observation of the Ag/Si contact interface. It is revealed that four kinds of Ag crystallites are grown with variant shapes and sizes on the pyramid tips, {111} planes, edges and tiny bumps at valleys of the textured Si surface resulting from anisotropic etching of Si emitter by the flowing molten glass frit during firing and the consequent epitaxially growth of Ag on the etching pits during cooling. All these Ag crystallites are in direct contact with Si emitter, serving as the most important contact points on the Si side. Meanwhile, three kinds of spherical Ag particles are formed in the resolidified glass frit during cooling which are crucial tunneling paths, conducting between glass-covered Ag crystallites on silicon and Ag bulk above. As a whole, four current transport paths are suggested mainly via Ag crystallites, Ag particles or both. In addition, the four electron transport paths are further confirmed by the Kelvin probe force microscopy characterization. The clarification and detailed understanding of all current transport paths are key points to design better silver paste and sintering process, and hence to improve the solar cell performance.

Abstract: The development of microencapsulated phase change materials with excellent photothermal conversion and storage performances is significant for solar energy utilization. Herein, a kind of the novel n-octadecane microcapsules with calcium carbonate-polydopamine (CaCO3-PDA) hierarchical shell was fabricated through a simple one-pot synthetic strategy. The n-octadecane droplets were firstly encapsulated into inorganic CaCO3 shell in the SDBS-templating emulsion, and subsequently the formed n-octadecane microcapsules were further modified by adhesive PDA. The resultant composite microcapsules displayed a regular and compact spherical morphology with a well-defined core-shell microstructure, and the light-absorption PDA coating uniformly deposited onto the CaCO3 shell surface. The phase change microcapsules possessed a satisfactory latent heat storage capability of more than 140 J g−1 and a favorable energy storage efficiency of about 60%. Owing to the existence of CaCO3 shell, the as-prepared n-octadecane microcapsules achieved a remarkable enhancement in the thermal conductivity compared to pristine n-octadecane. With the surface modification of PDA, the composite microcapsules demonstrated not only superior thermal stability and phase change reliability but also improved photothermal effect. Moreover, the microcapsules exhibited stable photothermal conversion and storage performances under the cycling sunlight irradiation. Therefore, the developed composite n-octadecane microcapsules in this work present a promising prospect in the field of solar-to-thermal energy utilization and storage.

Abstract: Here we synthesize a waterproof cross-linked gasochromic thin film obtained by incorporating Prussian blue nanoparticles, polyvinyl alcohol, crosslink agent: 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and catalytic platinum nanoparticles, applied by a single coating and heat process onto a substrate. The cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol-Prussian blue (PVA-PB) films reveal an excellent hydrophilic character. The contrast ratio at 700 nm reaches 87.2. The cycle stability exceeds 200 cycles. The switching time from deep blue to transparency took 14.3 s for bleaching and 600 s for darkening. Surface electron microscopy, electrochemical analysis and Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy were used to investigate a series of waterproof Prussian blue films. The results showed the redox mechanism between polymer matrix, chrome and catalytic nanoparticles.

Abstract: Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells convert thermally emitted photons into electrical power using photovoltaic (PV) detectors. To realize highly efficient thermal energy harvesting using TPV conversion, high-temperature stable spectrally-selective emitters are needed. The deployment of TPV technology lags behind conventional solar-PV technology due to the lack of large-scale fabrication of efficient thermal emitters, which would preferentially emit in the PV cell absorption band. In this work, we demonstrate a simple large-area nanofabrication method based on the hole-mask colloidal lithography and sputtering, which allows one to fabricate tungsten (W) nanodisc spectrally-selective emitters (consisting of a metal-insulator-metal configuration) with a high emissivity below the InGaAsSb PV-cell cut-off wavelength of 2.25 μm and a gradually decreasing emissivity (down to < 10%) in the mid-infrared region. Frequency-domain time-domain (FDTD) simulations reveal that the spectral selectivity is achieved due to the localized surface plasmon resonance of W nanodiscs strongly influenced by the insulator thickness. Importantly, the W emitters show thermal stability at temperatures of up to 1100 °C, and emissivity invariance to changes in polarization and incidence angles up to 65°. This work represents a significant step towards the realization of high-temperature stable efficient thermal emitters by a facile and cost-effective fabrication method, thereby promoting the implementation of photonic/plasmonic thermal emitters in the next-generation thermal energy harvesting systems. The method proposed in this study holds potential for scalability; however, empirical evidence to demonstrate this scalability has not yet been established. Subsequent studies are needed to confirm the scalability of the proposed method and its extensive applicability.

Abstract: As an optical property with excellent dielectric properties combined with antireflection, AlSiON is not currently being investigated as electrochromic devices. Based on the optimized Al3+ solid-state electrolyte Al2SiO5, which is doped with different levels of N elements, the opto-electrical properties of the formed AlSiON in electrochromic devices have been systematically examined. AlSiON with an N-doping ratio of 3.4% achieves outstanding optical modulation (58.17%) and switching speed (22.2 s for coloring and 3.5 s for bleaching), as well as an effective reduction of leakage currents (68.39 μA/cm2) in electrochromic devices. By XPS analysis, the N content of 3.4% AlSiON is internally bonded with a proportion of Si–N to Al–N bonds, which generates a dielectric high Si3N4 composition effectively blocking electron breakdown.

Abstract: Multi-junction all-perovskite tandem solar cells (A-PTSCs) can achieve higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) value beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, only one side of the substrate is used in traditional two-junction tandem devices architecture, so that two-terminal (2-T) tandem devices require the preparation of a high quality and complex interconnection layer (ICL) to connect the two sub-cells and four-terminal (4-T) tandem devices require two substrates for two sub-cells. Here we demonstrate a two-junction A-PTSC using a double-sided ITO (D-ITO) glass substrate. The wide bandgap (W-Eg) perovskite (1.75 eV) as the upper cell and the narrow bandgap (N-Eg) perovskite (1.21 eV) as the bottom cell are deposited on both side of the D-ITO substrate, respectively. By changing the wiring method, on a substrate, 2-T, three-terminal (3-T), and 4-T integrated A-PTSC are obtained with efficiencies of 21.17% for 2-T tandem architecture, 17.71% for 3-T and 21.55% for 4-T. The concept and design here represent a new architecture toward A-PTSCs.

Abstract: In recent years, the mixed halide Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) triggered huge amount of R&D activities, thanks to their excellent optoelectronic properties, fast progressing power conversion efficiencies and low cost potential. On top of that, with their high specific power & compatibility with flexible substrate, PSCs appear as a promising mid/long-term alternative photovoltaic technology for space applications. However, the harsh space environment requires particularly robust PV solutions, especially against electrons & protons irradiations; detailed evaluation and comprehension of ageing under irradiations are thus key steps on PSCs development path. In this paper, we focus on perovskite materials and subsequently solar cells proton radiation hardness, with a fluence up to 5 x 1014 protons/cm2 at 1 MeV. Optical, microstructural and electrical characterisations, both in-situ and ex-situ, are used to track the evolutions of 4 different perovskite stoichiometries under irradiation. To this end, single layers, sub-assemblies and full solar cells stack were exposed to protons flux. This systematic approach allowed us to highlight the differences in radiation hardness of PSCs constituting layers: the photo-active Cs0.05FA0.95Pb(I1-xBrx)3 materials exhibits outstanding radiation hardness under the tested conditions, while the PTAA Hole Transport Layer (HTL) appears as a weak contact layer driving cells performance degradation at high fluences.

Abstract: We demonstrate a novel method to fabricate passivated interdigitated back contact (IBC) crystalline silicon solar cells incorporating a maskless, patterned plasma etching step. After deposition in a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) chamber, the intrinsic and doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon and microcrystalline silicon layers (necessary for the passivated interdigitated contacts in such heterojunction technology (HJT) devices) are patterned via a single, maskless etching step, also performed in a PECVD chamber. The patterning step relies on selectively lighting an etching plasma within slits in the patterned powered electrode when it is placed very close to the substrate. The process flow is characterized and optimized at each step using spectroscopic ellipsometry, photoluminescence, and surface photovoltage mapping. It is shown that a critical step is the removal of a damaged layer formed on the surface after the patterned etching. Without this step, the IBC-HJT solar cells systematically exhibit S-shaped curves in their current-voltage (I–V) characteristics (giving fill factors below 25%). Once this critical step is included, the solar cells display I–V curves with fill factors above 65%, demonstrating the advantage of the maskless plasma patterning process.

Abstract: Electroplating technology which has the potential of reducing silver consumption and lowering fabrication costs has been widely used in the photovoltaic (PV) devices. However, the poor wettability of the polysilicon film limits the application of the electroplating technology on tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells (SCs). In this work, we propose a carbon (C)-doped polysilicon with highly polar C–Si bonds to improve the surface wettability of polysilicon film. By reducing the hydrogen bubble retention during plating, a uniform, dense, and void-free Ni seed layer can be obtained. To maintain the good conductivity of polysilicon, a double-layer polysilicon structure consisting of a C-doped and a C-free polysilicon films was constructed for TOPCon device fabrication. The new design shows an excellent passivation quality with an implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of 745 mV for the lifetime sample and a good contact performance with a low contact resistivity (ρc) of 2–3 mΩ cm2 between plated grids and polysilicon films. Finally, the proof-of-concept TOPCon devices with the double-layer polysilicon structure and plated metal electrodes deliver a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.18%. Therefore, the C-doped polysilicon combined with the electroplating technology demonstrated in this work shows great potential to obtain high-efficiency and low-cost TOPCon SCs in the PV industry.
