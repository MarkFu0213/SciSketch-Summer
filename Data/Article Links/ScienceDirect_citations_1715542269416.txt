Abstract: Summary
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are associated with mutations affecting synaptic components, including GluN2B-NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and neurobeachin (NBEA). NBEA participates in biosynthetic pathways to regulate synapse receptor targeting, synaptic function, cognition, and social behavior. However, the role of NBEA-mediated transport in specific trafficking routes is unclear. Here, we highlight an additional function for NBEA in the local delivery and surface re-insertion of synaptic receptors in mouse neurons. NBEA dynamically interacts with Rab4-positive recycling endosomes, transiently enters spines in an activity-dependent manner, and regulates GluN2B-NMDAR recycling. Furthermore, we show that the microtubule growth inhibitor kinesin KIF21B constrains NBEA dynamics and is present in the NBEA-recycling endosome-NMDAR complex. Notably, Kif21b knockout decreases NMDAR surface expression and alters social behavior in mice, consistent with reported social deficits in Nbea mutants. The influence of NBEA-KIF21B interactions on GluN2B-NMDAR local recycling may be relevant to mechanisms underlying ASD etiology.

Abstract: Summary
Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention with potential benefits for healthspan improvement and lifespan extension. In 53 (34 CR and 19 control) non-obese adults, we tested the hypothesis that energy expenditure (EE) and its endocrine mediators are reduced with a CR diet over 2 years. Approximately 15% CR was achieved over 2 years, resulting in an average 8.7 kg weight loss, whereas controls gained 1.8 kg. In the CR group, EE measured over 24 hr or during sleep was approximately 80–120 kcal/day lower than expected on the basis of weight loss, indicating sustained metabolic adaptation over 2 years. This metabolic adaptation was accompanied by significantly reduced thyroid axis activity and reactive oxygen species (F2-isoprostane) production. Findings from this 2-year CR trial in healthy, non-obese humans provide new evidence of persistent metabolic slowing accompanied by reduced oxidative stress, which supports the rate of living and oxidative damage theories of mammalian aging.

Abstract: Summary
Platinum-based chemotherapeutics represent a mainstay of cancer therapy, but resistance limits their curative potential. Through a kinome RNAi screen, we identified microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase 1 (MAST1) as a main driver of cisplatin resistance in human cancers. Mechanistically, cisplatin but no other DNA-damaging agents inhibit the MAPK pathway by dissociating cRaf from MEK1, while MAST1 replaces cRaf to reactivate the MAPK pathway in a cRaf-independent manner. We show clinical evidence that expression of MAST1, both initial and cisplatin-induced, contributes to platinum resistance and worse clinical outcome. Targeting MAST1 with lestaurtinib, a recently identified MAST1 inhibitor, restores cisplatin sensitivity, leading to the synergistic attenuation of cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in human cancer cells and patient-derived xenograft models.

Abstract: Calcium ions are involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Fourteen genes encoding calcium binding proteins have been identified in Dictyostelium. CBP7, one of the 14 CBPs, is composed of 169 amino acids and contains four EF-hand motifs. Here, we investigated the roles of CBP7 in the development and cell migration of Dictyostelium cells and found that high levels of CBP7 exerted a negative effect on cells aggregation during development, possibly by inhibiting chemoattractant-directed cell migration. While cells lacking CBP7 exhibited normal development and chemotaxis similar that of wild-type cells, CBP7 overexpressing cells completely lost their chemotactic abilities to move toward increasing cAMP concentrations. This resulted in inhibition of cellular aggregation, a process required for forming multicellular organisms during development. Low levels of cytosolic free calcium were observed in CBP7 overexpressing cells, which was likely the underlying cause of their lack of chemotaxis. Our results demonstrate that CBP7 plays an important role in cell spreading and cell-substrate adhesion. cbp7 null cells showed decreased cell size and cell-substrate adhesion. The present study contributes to further understanding the role of calcium signaling in regulation of cell migration and development.

Abstract: Summary
During vertebrate fertilization, sperm chromatin remodeling occurs concomitantly with maternal chromosome segregation at anaphase II, leading to simultaneous formation of two pronuclei. In mammals, these processes take much longer than in other vertebrates. Here, we explore the molecular basis and physiological importance of this mammalian-specific temporal regulation using mouse oocytes. We demonstrate the involvement of protein phosphatase in temporal regulation. Early onset of pronuclear formation causes paternal-biased abnormalities in pronuclear morphology and chromosome segregation at the first mitosis. After oocyte activation, CDK1-MASTL-ENSA, a protein phosphatase 2A-suppressive pathway, remains active despite the absence of cyclin B and contributes to delayed pronuclear formation. Sustained activation of MASTL involves ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK)-mediated phosphorylation of Thr297, which is conserved only among mammalian MASTLs. Our findings reveal the role of RSK in mouse oocytes, showing that the RSK-MASTL pathway allows mammalian-specific prolonged meiotic exit and ensures the faithful conversion from sperm to paternal pronuclei.

Abstract: Multipotent neural stem cells could generate neurons and glial cells. Wide studies have been conducted to disclose the mechanism underlying neural stem cell differentiation and multiple factors have been identified in this field, one of which is bioactive components including natural herbal medicine. In this study, we found that magnesium lithospermate B is able to promote proliferation of neural stem cell in vitro. Besides, magnesium lithospermate B also induces generation of more neuronal cells and less glial cells. The in vivo studies indicates that magnesium lithospermate B enhances local neurogenesis since more Ki67+ and Thy1+ cells are observed in hippocampal region with injection of magnesium lithospermate B. Interestingly, enhancing proliferation and neurogenesis occurs in medial forebrain bundle of Parkinson’s Disease model and behavioral studies demonstrates that motor function is significantly improved in magnesium lithospermate B-treated disease models. Furthermore, we also found that effect of MLB on proliferation and differentiation of NSCs was mediated by PI3K/Akt signaling. Collectively, our study shows the important role of magnesium lithospermate B in neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation, accordingly providing a simple and efficient method to induce the neuronal cell generation in neurodegenerative disease model.

Abstract: Summary
Protein complexes are assemblies of subunits that have co-evolved to execute one or many coordinated functions in the cellular environment. Functional annotation of mammalian protein complexes is critical to understanding biological processes, as well as disease mechanisms. Here, we used genetic co-essentiality derived from genome-scale RNAi- and CRISPR-Cas9-based fitness screens performed across hundreds of human cancer cell lines to assign measures of functional similarity. From these measures, we systematically built and characterized functional similarity networks that recapitulate known structural and functional features of well-studied protein complexes and resolve novel functional modules within complexes lacking structural resolution, such as the mammalian SWI/SNF complex. Finally, by integrating functional networks with large protein-protein interaction networks, we discovered novel protein complexes involving recently evolved genes of unknown function. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the utility of genetic perturbation screens alone, and in combination with large-scale biophysical data, to enhance our understanding of mammalian protein complexes in normal and disease states.

Abstract: Summary
Endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complex proteins regulate biogenesis and release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which enable cell-to-cell communication in the nervous system essential for development and adult function. We recently showed human loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in ESCRT-III member CHMP1A cause autosomal recessive microcephaly with pontocerebellar hypoplasia, but its mechanism was unclear. Here, we show Chmp1a is required for progenitor proliferation in mouse cortex and cerebellum and progenitor maintenance in human cerebral organoids. In Chmp1a null mice, this defect is associated with impaired sonic hedgehog (Shh) secretion and intraluminal vesicle (ILV) formation in multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Furthermore, we show CHMP1A is important for release of an EV subtype that contains AXL, RAB18, and TMED10 (ART) and SHH. Our findings show CHMP1A loss impairs secretion of SHH on ART-EVs, providing molecular mechanistic insights into the role of ESCRT proteins and EVs in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Gastric emptying is a critical regulator of postprandial glucose and delayed gastric emptying is an important mechanism of improved glycemic control achieved by short-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs in clinical practice. Here we report on a novel regulatory mechanism of gastric emptying in humans. We show that increasing interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations delays gastric emptying leading to reduced postprandial glycemia. IL-6 furthermore reduces insulin secretion in a GLP-1-dependent manner while effects on gastric emptying are GLP-1 independent. Inhibitory effects of IL-6 on gastric emptying were confirmed following exercise-induced increases in IL-6. Importantly, gastric- and insulin-reducing effects were maintained in individuals with type 2 diabetes. These data have clinical implications with respect to the use of IL-6 inhibition in autoimmune/inflammatory disease, and identify a novel target that could be exploited pharmacologically to delay gastric emptying and spare insulin, which may be beneficial for the beta cell in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
All biological systems exhibit cell-to-cell variability. Frameworks exist for understanding how stochastic fluctuations and transient differences in cell state contribute to experimentally observable variations in cellular responses. However, current methods do not allow identification of the sources of variability between and within stable subpopulations of cells. We present a data-driven modeling framework for the analysis of populations comprising heterogeneous subpopulations. Our approach combines mixture modeling with frameworks for distribution approximation, facilitating the integration of multiple single-cell datasets and the detection of causal differences between and within subpopulations. The computational efficiency of our framework allows hundreds of competing hypotheses to be compared. We initially validate our method using simulated data with an understood ground truth, then we analyze data collected using quantitative single-cell microscopy of cultured sensory neurons involved in pain initiation. This approach allows us to quantify the relative contribution of neuronal subpopulations, culture conditions, and expression levels of signaling proteins to the observed cell-to-cell variability in NGF/TrkA-initiated Erk1/2 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic immunomodulation involving IL-1 has been investigated for unfavorable metabolic effects, including obesity, but a potentially favorable role for IL-1 remains unclear. Here, we find mechanistic interactions between working skeletal muscles and locally recruited neutrophils expressing IL-1β, which supports muscle performance through priming exercise-dependent GLUT4 translocation. Thus, during exercise, both IL-1α/β-deficient and neutrophil-depleted mice similarly exhibit increased fatigability associated with impaired muscle glucose homeostasis due to GLUT4 dysregulation. Deficiency of IL-1-producing neutrophils results in intrinsic abnormalities represented by aberrant Rac1 signaling and irregular GLUT4-storage vesicles, suggesting that these properties are maintained by local IL-1 produced by recruited neutrophils upon exercise, possibly on a daily basis. We propose that neutrophils are highly engaged in skeletal muscle performance via IL-1 regulation, which coordinates favorable inflammatory microenvironments supporting muscle glucose metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Menin (MEN1) is a critical modulator of tissue development and maintenance. As such, MEN1 mutations are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. Although menin is abundantly expressed in the nervous system, little is known with regard to its function in the adult brain. Here, we demonstrate that neuron-specific deletion of Men1 (CcKO) affects dendritic branching and spine formation, resulting in defects in synaptic function, learning, and memory. Furthermore, we find that menin binds to the p35 promoter region to facilitate p35 transcription. As a primary Cdk5 activator, p35 is expressed mainly in neurons and is critical for brain development and synaptic plasticity. Restoration of p35 expression in the hippocampus and cortex of Men1 CcKO mice rescues synaptic and cognitive deficits associated with Men1 deletion. These results reveal a critical role for menin in synaptic and cognitive function by modulating the p35-Cdk5 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Dendrites in many neurons actively compute information. In retinal starburst amacrine cells, transformations from synaptic input to output occur within individual dendrites and mediate direction selectivity, but directional signal fidelity at individual synaptic outputs and correlated activity among neighboring outputs on starburst dendrites have not been examined systematically. Here, we record visually evoked calcium signals simultaneously at many individual synaptic outputs within single starburst amacrine cells in mouse retina. We measure visual receptive fields of individual output synapses and show that small groups of outputs are functionally compartmentalized within starburst dendrites, creating distinct computational units. Inhibition enhances compartmentalization and directional tuning of individual outputs but also decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Simulations suggest, however, that the noise underlying output signal variability is well tolerated by postsynaptic direction-selective ganglion cells, which integrate convergent inputs to acquire reliable directional information.

Abstract: Summary
Translation initiation is typically restricted to AUG codons, and scanning eukaryotic ribosomes inefficiently recognize near-cognate codons. We show that queuing of scanning ribosomes behind a paused elongating ribosome promotes initiation at upstream weak start sites. Ribosomal profiling reveals polyamine-dependent pausing of elongating ribosomes on a conserved Pro-Pro-Trp (PPW) motif in an inhibitory non-AUG-initiated upstream conserved coding region (uCC) of the antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) mRNA, encoding a regulator of cellular polyamine synthesis. Mutation of the PPW motif impairs initiation at the uCC’s upstream near-cognate AUU start site and derepresses AZIN1 synthesis, whereas substitution of alternate elongation pause sequences restores uCC translation. Impairing ribosome loading reduces uCC translation and paradoxically derepresses AZIN1 synthesis. Finally, we identify the translation factor eIF5A as a sensor and effector for polyamine control of uCC translation. We propose that stalling of elongating ribosomes triggers queuing of scanning ribosomes and promotes initiation by positioning a ribosome near the start codon.

Abstract: Summary
Apoptosis culminates in the activation of caspase-3, which plays an important role in implementing the cell death program. Here, we reveal a non-apoptotic role of caspase-3 as a key regulator of cell proliferation and organ size. Caspase-3 is specifically activated in the proliferating cells of the sebaceous gland, but does not instruct cell elimination. Deletion or chemical inhibition of caspase-3 diminishes cell proliferation, decreases cell number and reduces sebaceous gland size in vivo. Exploring the underlying mechanism, we demonstrate that α-catenin is cleaved by caspase-3, thus facilitating the activation and nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein (YAP), a vital regulator of organ size. Accordingly, activation of caspase-3 leads to YAP-dependent organ size augmentation. Finally, we show that X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) serves as an endogenous feedback antagonist for the caspase-3/YAP signaling module. Taken together, we report here a molecular mechanism wherein the apoptotic machinery is refocused to regulate cell proliferation and orchestrate organ size.

Abstract: Summary
Excessive consumption of sweets is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. A major chemical feature of sweets is fructose. Despite strong ties between fructose and disease, the metabolic fate of fructose in mammals remains incompletely understood. Here we use isotope tracing and mass spectrometry to track the fate of glucose and fructose carbons in vivo, finding that dietary fructose is cleared by the small intestine. Clearance requires the fructose-phosphorylating enzyme ketohexokinase. Low doses of fructose are ∼90% cleared by the intestine, with only trace fructose but extensive fructose-derived glucose, lactate, and glycerate found in the portal blood. High doses of fructose (≥1 g/kg) overwhelm intestinal fructose absorption and clearance, resulting in fructose reaching both the liver and colonic microbiota. Intestinal fructose clearance is augmented both by prior exposure to fructose and by feeding. We propose that the small intestine shields the liver from otherwise toxic fructose exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Upon injury, Müller glia cells of the zebrafish retina reprogram themselves to progenitor cells with stem cell characteristics. This necessity for retina regeneration is often compromised in mammals. We explored the significance of developmentally inevitable Sonic hedgehog signaling and found its necessity in MG reprogramming during retina regeneration. We report on stringent translational regulation of sonic hedgehog, smoothened, and patched1 by let-7 microRNA, which is regulated by Lin28a, in Müller glia (MG)-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs). We also show Shh-signaling-mediated induction of Ascl1 in mouse and zebrafish retina. Moreover, Shh-signaling-dependent regulation of matrix metalloproteinase9, in turn, regulates Shha levels and genes essential for retina regeneration, such as lin28a, zic2b, and foxn4. These observations were further confirmed through whole-retina RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. This mechanistic gene expression network could lead to a better understanding of retina regeneration and, consequently, aid in designing strategies for therapeutic intervention in human retinal diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleoside-containing metabolites such as NAD+ can be incorporated as 5′ caps on RNA by serving as non-canonical initiating nucleotides (NCINs) for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here, we report CapZyme-seq, a high-throughput-sequencing method that employs NCIN-decapping enzymes NudC and Rai1 to detect and quantify NCIN-capped RNA. By combining CapZyme-seq with multiplexed transcriptomics, we determine efficiencies of NAD+ capping by Escherichia coli RNAP for ∼16,000 promoter sequences. The results define preferred transcription start site (TSS) positions for NAD+ capping and define a consensus promoter sequence for NAD+ capping: HRRASWW (TSS underlined). By applying CapZyme-seq to E. coli total cellular RNA, we establish that sequence determinants for NCIN capping in vivo match the NAD+-capping consensus defined in vitro, and we identify and quantify NCIN-capped small RNAs (sRNAs). Our findings define the promoter-sequence determinants for NCIN capping with NAD+ and provide a general method for analysis of NCIN capping in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Recent identification of a mammary gland-specific microbiome led to studies investigating bacteria populations in breast cancer. Malignant breast tumors have lower Lactobacillus abundance compared with benign lesions, implicating Lactobacillus as a negative regulator of breast cancer. Diet is a main determinant of gut microbial diversity. Whether diet affects breast microbiome populations is unknown. In a non-human primate model, we found that consumption of a Western or Mediterranean diet modulated mammary gland microbiota and metabolite profiles. Mediterranean diet consumption led to increased mammary gland Lactobacillus abundance compared with Western diet-fed monkeys. Moreover, mammary glands from Mediterranean diet-fed monkeys had higher levels of bile acid metabolites and increased bacterial-processed bioactive compounds. These data suggest that diet directly influences microbiome populations outside the intestinal tract in distal sites such as the mammary gland. Our study demonstrates that diet affects the mammary gland microbiome, establishing an alternative mechanistic pathway for breast cancer prevention.

Abstract: Summary
The role of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), a key enzyme of the serine synthesis pathway (SSP), in endothelial cells (ECs) remains poorly characterized. We report that mouse neonates with EC-specific PHGDH deficiency suffer lethal vascular defects within days of gene inactivation, due to reduced EC proliferation and survival. In addition to nucleotide synthesis impairment, PHGDH knockdown (PHGDHKD) caused oxidative stress, due not only to decreased glutathione and NADPH synthesis but also to mitochondrial dysfunction. Electron transport chain (ETC) enzyme activities were compromised upon PHGDHKD because of insufficient heme production due to cellular serine depletion, not observed in other cell types. As a result of heme depletion, elevated reactive oxygen species levels caused EC demise. Supplementation of hemin in PHGDHKD ECs restored ETC function and rescued the apoptosis and angiogenesis defects. These data argue that ECs die upon PHGDH inhibition, even without external serine deprivation, illustrating an unusual importance of serine synthesis for ECs.

Abstract: Summary
We have applied optogenetics and mGRASP, a light microscopy technique that labels synaptic contacts, to map the number and strength of defined corticocollicular (CC) connections. Using mGRASP, we show that CC projections form small, medium, and large synapses, and both the number and the distribution of synapse size vary among the IC regions. Using optogenetics, we show that low-frequency stimulation of CC axons expressing channelrhodopsin produces prolonged elevations of the CC miniature EPSC (mEPSC) rate. Functional analysis of CC mEPSCs reveals small-, medium-, and large-amplitude events that mirror the synaptic distributions observed with mGRASP. Our results reveal that descending ipsilateral projections dominate CC feedback via an increased number of large synaptic contacts, especially onto the soma of IC neurons. This study highlights the feasibility of combining microscopy (i.e., mGRASP) and optogenetics to reveal synaptic weighting of defined projections at the level of single neurons, enabling functional connectomic mapping in diverse neural circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Splenic CD169+ macrophages are located in the marginal zone to efficiently capture blood-borne pathogens. Here, we investigate the requirements for the induction of CD8+ T cell responses by antigens (Ags) bound by CD169+ macrophages. Upon Ag targeting to CD169+ macrophages, we show that BATF3-dependent CD8α+ dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for DNGR-1-mediated cross-priming of CD8+ T cell responses. In addition, we demonstrate that CD169, a sialic acid binding lectin involved in cell-cell contact, preferentially binds to CD8α+ DCs and that Ag transfer to CD8α+ DCs and subsequent T cell activation is dependent on the sialic acid-binding capacity of CD169. Finally, functional CD169 mediates optimal CD8+ T cell responses to modified vaccinia Ankara virus infection. Together, these data indicate that the collaboration of CD169+ macrophages and CD8α+ DCs for the initiation of effective CD8+ T cell responses is facilitated by binding of CD169 to sialic acid containing ligands on CD8α+ DCs.

Oncogenic KRAS suppresses store-operated Ca2+ entry and ICRAC through ERK pathway-dependent remodelling of STIM expression in colorectal cancer cell lines,

Abstract: The KRAS GTPase plays a fundamental role in transducing signals from plasma membrane growth factor receptors to downstream signalling pathways controlling cell proliferation, survival and migration. Activating KRAS mutations are found in 20% of all cancers and in up to 40% of colorectal cancers, where they contribute to dysregulation of cell processes underlying oncogenic transformation. Multiple KRAS-regulated cell functions are also influenced by changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels that are concurrently modified by receptor signalling pathways. Suppression of intracellular Ca2+ release mechanisms can confer a survival advantage in cancer cells, and changes in Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane modulate cell migration and proliferation. However, inconsistent remodelling of Ca2+ influx and its signalling role has been reported in studies of transformed cells. To isolate the interaction between altered Ca2+ handling and mutated KRAS in colorectal cancer, we have previously employed isogenic cell line pairs, differing by the presence of an oncogenic KRAS allele (encoding KRASG13D), and have shown that reduced Ca2+ release from the ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake contributes to the survival advantage conferred by oncogenic KRAS. Here we show in the same cell lines, that Store-Operated Ca2+ Entry (SOCE) and its underlying current, ICRAC are under the influence of KRASG13D. Specifically, deletion of the oncogenic KRAS allele resulted in enhanced STIM1 expression and greater Ca2+ influx. Consistent with the role of KRAS in the activation of the ERK pathway, MEK inhibition in cells with KRASG13D resulted in increased STIM1 expression. Further, ectopic expression of STIM1 in HCT 116 cells (which express KRASG13D) rescued SOCE, demonstrating a fundamental role of STIM1 in suppression of Ca2+ entry downstream of KRASG13D. These results add to the understanding of how ERK controls cancer cell physiology and highlight STIM1 as an important biomarker in cancerogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
We present an integromic analysis of gene alterations that modulate transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-Smad-mediated signaling in 9,125 tumor samples across 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Focusing on genes that encode mediators and regulators of TGF-β signaling, we found at least one genomic alteration (mutation, homozygous deletion, or amplification) in 39% of samples, with highest frequencies in gastrointestinal cancers. We identified mutation hotspots in genes that encode TGF-β ligands (BMP5), receptors (TGFBR2, AVCR2A, and BMPR2), and Smads (SMAD2 and SMAD4). Alterations in the TGF-β superfamily correlated positively with expression of metastasis-associated genes and with decreased survival. Correlation analyses showed the contributions of mutation, amplification, deletion, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression to transcriptional activity of TGF-β signaling in each cancer type. This study provides a broad molecular perspective relevant for future functional and therapeutic studies of the diverse cancer pathways mediated by the TGF-β superfamily.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial quality control is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis and is achieved by removing damaged, ubiquitinated mitochondria via Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Here, we demonstrate that MYO6 (myosin VI), a unique myosin that moves toward the minus end of actin filaments, forms a complex with Parkin and is selectively recruited to damaged mitochondria via its ubiquitin-binding domain. This myosin motor initiates the assembly of F-actin cages to encapsulate damaged mitochondria by forming a physical barrier that prevents refusion with neighboring populations. Loss of MYO6 results in an accumulation of mitophagosomes and an increase in mitochondrial mass. In addition, we observe downstream mitochondrial dysfunction manifesting as reduced respiratory capacity and decreased ability to rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production. Our work uncovers a crucial step in mitochondrial quality control: the formation of MYO6-dependent actin cages that ensure isolation of damaged mitochondria from the network.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic transcription factors such as the leukemic fusion protein RUNX1/ETO, which drives t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), constitute cancer-specific but highly challenging therapeutic targets. We used epigenomic profiling data for an RNAi screen to interrogate the transcriptional network maintaining t(8;21) AML. This strategy identified Cyclin D2 (CCND2) as a crucial transmitter of RUNX1/ETO-driven leukemic propagation. RUNX1/ETO cooperates with AP-1 to drive CCND2 expression. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of CCND2 by an approved drug significantly impairs leukemic expansion of patient-derived AML cells and engraftment in immunodeficient murine hosts. Our data demonstrate that RUNX1/ETO maintains leukemia by promoting cell cycle progression and identifies G1 CCND-CDK complexes as promising therapeutic targets for treatment of RUNX1/ETO-driven AML.

Abstract: Summary
MYC is an oncogenic driver that regulates transcriptional activation and repression. Surprisingly, mechanisms by which MYC promotes malignant transformation remain unclear. We demonstrate that MYC interacts with the G9a H3K9-methyltransferase complex to control transcriptional repression. Inhibiting G9a hinders MYC chromatin binding at MYC-repressed genes and de-represses gene expression. By identifying the MYC box II region as essential for MYC-G9a interaction, a long-standing missing link between MYC transformation and gene repression is unveiled. Across breast cancer cell lines, the anti-proliferative response to G9a pharmacological inhibition correlates with MYC sensitivity and gene signatures. Consistently, genetically depleting G9a in vivo suppresses MYC-dependent tumor growth. These findings unveil G9a as an epigenetic regulator of MYC transcriptional repression and a therapeutic vulnerability in MYC-driven cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Dopamine (DA) loss in Parkinson’s disease (PD) alters the function of striatal projection neurons (SPNs) and causes motor deficits, but DA replacement can induce further abnormalities. A key pathological change in animal models and patients is SPN hyperactivity; however, the role of glutamate in altered DA responses remains elusive. We tested the effect of locally applied AMPAR or NMDAR antagonists on glutamatergic signaling in SPNs of parkinsonian primates. Following a reduction in basal hyperactivity by antagonists at either receptor, DA inputs induced SPN firing changes that were stable during the entire motor response, in clear contrast with the typically unstable effects. The SPN activity reduction over an extended putamenal area controlled the release of involuntary movements in the “on” state and therefore improved motor responses to DA replacement. These results demonstrate the pathophysiological role of upregulated SPN activity and support strategies to reduce striatal glutamate signaling for PD therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The gene encoding the chromatin remodeler CHD8 is the most frequently mutated gene in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Heterozygous mutations in CHD8 give rise to ASD that is often accompanied by macrocephaly, gastrointestinal complaints, and slender habitus. Whereas most phenotypes of CHD8 haploinsufficiency likely result from delayed neurodevelopment, the mechanism underlying slender habitus has remained unknown. Here, we show that CHD8 interacts with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) and promotes its transactivation activity during adipocyte differentiation. Adipogenesis was impaired in Chd8-deleted preadipocytes, with the upregulation of C/EBPα and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), two master regulators of this process, being attenuated in mutant cells. Furthermore, mice with CHD8 ablation in white preadipocytes had a markedly reduced white adipose tissue mass. Our findings reveal a mode of C/EBPβ regulation by CHD8 during adipogenesis, with CHD8 deficiency resulting in a defect in the development of white adipose tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Contractile forces eliminate cell contacts in many morphogenetic processes. However, mechanisms that balance contractile forces to promote subtler remodeling remain unknown. To address this gap, we investigated remodeling of Drosophila eye lattice cells (LCs), which preserve cell contacts as they narrow to form the edges of a multicellular hexagonal lattice. We found that during narrowing, LC-LC contacts dynamically constrict and expand. Similar to other systems, actomyosin-based contractile forces promote pulses of constriction. Conversely, we found that WAVE-dependent branched F-actin accumulates at LC-LC contacts during expansion and functions to expand the cell apical area, promote shape changes, and prevent elimination of LC-LC contacts. Finally, we found that small Rho GTPases regulate the balance of contractile and protrusive dynamics. These data suggest a mechanism by which WAVE regulatory complex-based F-actin dynamics antagonize contractile forces to regulate cell shape and tissue topology during remodeling and thus contribute to the robustness and precision of the process.

Abstract: Summary
LIN28 is a bipartite RNA-binding protein that post-transcriptionally inhibits the biogenesis of let-7 microRNAs to regulate development and influence disease states. However, the mechanisms of let-7 suppression remain poorly understood because LIN28 recognition depends on coordinated targeting by both the zinc knuckle domain (ZKD), which binds a GGAG-like element in the precursor, and the cold shock domain (CSD), whose binding sites have not been systematically characterized. By leveraging single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of LIN28 binding sites in vivo, we determined that the CSD recognizes a (U)GAU motif. This motif partitions the let-7 microRNAs into two subclasses, precursors with both CSD and ZKD binding sites (CSD+) and precursors with ZKD but no CSD binding sites (CSD−). LIN28 in vivo recognition—and subsequent 3ʹ uridylation and degradation—of CSD+ precursors is more efficient, leading to their stronger suppression in LIN28-activated cells and cancers. Thus, CSD binding sites amplify the regulatory effects of LIN28.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common type of arthritis, is a disabling progressive disease mainly affecting the elderly and is becoming a major public health problem. Current therapies for OA provide only palliative pain relief and therapeutic candidates that are able to slow the progression of structural deterioration is a major unmet need for this disorder. Avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) has proven its safety and effectiveness in clinical studies of knee osteoarthritis (OA); however, whether ASU exerts structure-modifying effects is still to be elucidated. There are limited studies that have explored the underlying mechanisms of ASU’s beneficial effects in animal models of OA. To this end, this study is the first to evaluate the effects of ASU in a rat model of mono-iodoacetate (MIA)-induced knee OA. OA was induced in rats by knee intra-patellar injection of MIA. Oral administration of ASU (27.5 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) was initiated 3 weeks after MIA injection. We analysed the knee samples using light and electron microscopy. In addition, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) in OA cartilage and subchondral bone. ASU significantly attenuated the synovium, cartilage, and subchondral degeneration. In addition, it reduced the expression of TNF-α and MMP-13 in OA cartilage and the expression of iNOS in both OA cartilage and subchondral bone. These results provide evidence of the structure-modifying abilities of ASU via its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, in addition to its ability to modulate MMP-13 activity. This work suggests that ASU can be used as a potential disease-modifying treatment for OA.

Abstract: Summary
Although the MYC oncogene has been implicated in cancer, a systematic assessment of alterations of MYC, related transcription factors, and co-regulatory proteins, forming the proximal MYC network (PMN), across human cancers is lacking. Using computational approaches, we define genomic and proteomic features associated with MYC and the PMN across the 33 cancers of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Pan-cancer, 28% of all samples had at least one of the MYC paralogs amplified. In contrast, the MYC antagonists MGA and MNT were the most frequently mutated or deleted members, proposing a role as tumor suppressors. MYC alterations were mutually exclusive with PIK3CA, PTEN, APC, or BRAF alterations, suggesting that MYC is a distinct oncogenic driver. Expression analysis revealed MYC-associated pathways in tumor subtypes, such as immune response and growth factor signaling; chromatin, translation, and DNA replication/repair were conserved pan-cancer. This analysis reveals insights into MYC biology and is a reference for biomarkers and therapeutics for cancers with alterations of MYC or the PMN.

Abstract: Summary
EGFR activates phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), but the mechanism underlying this activation is not completely understood. We demonstrated here that EGFR activation resulted in lysine acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5)-mediated K395 acetylation of the platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase 1 (PFKP) and subsequent translocation of PFKP to the plasma membrane, where the PFKP was phosphorylated at Y64 by EGFR. Phosphorylated PFKP binds to the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85α, which is distinct from binding of Gab1 to the C-terminal SH2 domain of p85α, and recruited p85α to the plasma membrane resulting in PI3K activation. PI3K-dependent AKT activation results in enhanced phosphofructokinase 2 (PFK2) phosphorylation and production of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which in turn promotes PFK1 activation. PFKP Y64 phosphorylation–enhanced PI3K/AKT-dependent PFK1 activation and GLUT1 expression promoted the Warburg effect, tumor cell proliferation, and brain tumorigenesis. These findings underscore the instrumental role of PFKP in PI3K activation and enhanced glycolysis through PI3K/AKT-dependent positive-feedback regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Recent progress in direct lineage reprogramming has enabled the generation of induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells and revealed their potential as an alternative to hepatocytes for medical applications. However, the hepatic functions of iHep cells are insufficient compared with those of primary hepatocytes. Here, we show that cell-aggregate formation can rapidly induce growth arrest and hepatic maturation of iHep cells through activation of Hippo signaling. During formation of iHep cell aggregates, Yap inactivation is induced by actin reorganization and intercellular adhesion, leading to upregulation of Hnf1α expression in the absence of the Yap/Tead/Chd4 transcriptional repressor unit. Hnf1α then acts as a central transcription factor that regulates liver-enriched gene expression in iHep cell aggregates and induces functional differentiation of iHep cells. Moreover, iHep cell aggregates efficiently reconstitute injured liver tissues and support hepatic function after transplantation. Thus, iHep cell aggregates may provide insights into basic research and potential therapies for liver diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Processes like cellular senescence are characterized by complex events giving rise to heterogeneous cell populations. However, the early molecular events driving this cascade remain elusive. We hypothesized that senescence entry is triggered by an early disruption of the cells’ three-dimensional (3D) genome organization. To test this, we combined Hi-C, single-cell and population transcriptomics, imaging, and in silico modeling of three distinct cells types entering senescence. Genes involved in DNA conformation maintenance are suppressed upon senescence entry across all cell types. We show that nuclear depletion of the abundant HMGB2 protein occurs early on the path to senescence and coincides with the dramatic spatial clustering of CTCF. Knocking down HMGB2 suffices for senescence-induced CTCF clustering and for loop reshuffling, while ectopically expressing HMGB2 rescues these effects. Our data suggest that HMGB2-mediated genomic reorganization constitutes a primer for the ensuing senescent program.

Abstract: Summary
Oocyte quality control culls eggs with defects in meiosis. In mouse, oocyte death can be triggered by defects in chromosome synapsis and recombination, which involve repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) between homologous chromosomes. We show that RNF212, a SUMO ligase required for crossing over, also mediates oocyte quality control. Both physiological apoptosis and wholesale oocyte elimination in meiotic mutants require RNF212. RNF212 sensitizes oocytes to DSB-induced apoptosis within a narrow window as chromosomes desynapse and cells transition into quiescence. Analysis of DNA damage during this transition implies that RNF212 impedes DSB repair. Consistently, RNF212 is required for HORMAD1, a negative regulator of inter-sister recombination, to associate with desynapsing chromosomes. We infer that oocytes impede repair of residual DSBs to retain a “memory” of meiotic defects that enables quality-control processes. These results define the logic of oocyte quality control and suggest RNF212 variants may influence transmission of defective genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Acute pain evokes protective neural and behavioral responses. Chronic pain, however, disrupts normal nociceptive processing. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to exert top-down regulation of sensory inputs; unfortunately, how individual PFC neurons respond to an acute pain signal is not well characterized. We found that neurons in the prelimbic region of the PFC increased firing rates of the neurons after noxious stimulations in free-moving rats. Chronic pain, however, suppressed both basal spontaneous and pain-evoked firing rates. Furthermore, we identified a linear correlation between basal and evoked firing rates of PFC neurons, whereby a decrease in basal firing leads to a nearly 2-fold reduction in pain-evoked response in chronic pain states. In contrast, enhancing basal PFC activity with low-frequency optogenetic stimulation scaled up prefrontal outputs to inhibit pain. These results demonstrate a cortical gain control system for nociceptive regulation and establish scaling up prefrontal outputs as an effective neuromodulation strategy to inhibit pain.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors PU.1 and CEBPA are required for the proper coordination of enhancer activity during granulocytic-monocytic (GM) lineage differentiation to form myeloid cells. However, precisely how these factors control the chronology of enhancer establishment during differentiation is not known. Through integrated analyses of enhancer dynamics, transcription factor binding, and proximal gene expression during successive stages of murine GM-lineage differentiation, we unravel the distinct kinetics by which PU.1 and CEBPA coordinate GM enhancer activity. We find no evidence of a pioneering function of PU.1 during late GM-lineage differentiation. Instead, we delineate a set of enhancers that gain accessibility in a CEBPA-dependent manner, suggesting a pioneering function of CEBPA. Analyses of Cebpa null bone marrow demonstrate that CEBPA controls PU.1 levels and, unexpectedly, that the loss of CEBPA results in an early differentiation block. Taken together, our data provide insights into how PU.1 and CEBPA functionally interact to drive GM-lineage differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The mode of regulation of Src kinases has been elucidated by crystallographic studies identifying conserved structured protein modules involved in an orderly set of intramolecular associations and ligand interactions. Despite these detailed insights, much of the complex behavior and diversity in the Src family remains unexplained. A key missing piece is the function of the unstructured N-terminal region. We report here the function of the N-terminal region in binding within a hydrophobic pocket in the kinase domain of a dimerization partner. Dimerization substantially enhances autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of selected substrates, and interfering with dimerization is disruptive to these functions. Dimerization and Y419 phosphorylation are codependent events creating a bistable switch. Given the versatility inherent in this intrinsically disordered region, its multisite phosphorylations, and its divergence within the family, the unique domain likely functions as a central signaling hub overseeing much of the activities and unique functions of Src family kinases.

Abstract: Summary
Newborn neurons follow molecular cues to reach their final destination, but whether early life experience influences lamination remains largely unexplored. As light is among the first stimuli to reach the developing nervous system via intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), we asked whether ipRGCs could affect lamination in the developing mouse retina. We show here that ablation of ipRGCs causes cone photoreceptors to mislocalize at different apicobasal positions in the retina. This effect is partly mediated by light-evoked activity in ipRGCs, as dark rearing or silencing of ipRGCs leads a subset of cones to mislocalize. Furthermore, ablation of ipRGCs alters the cone transcriptome and decreases expression of the dopamine receptor D4, while injection of L-DOPA or D4 receptor agonist rescues the displaced cone phenotype observed in dark-reared animals. These results show that early light-mediated activity in ipRGCs influences neuronal lamination and identify ipRGC-elicited dopamine release as a mechanism influencing cone position.

Abstract: Recently, we have reported that animals with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) overexpression exhibit reduced social interaction, decreased preference for novel social interaction and poor nest-building behaviors symptoms that mirror those observed in human autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Overexpression of TERT also alters the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio in the medial prefrontal cortex. However, the effects of TERT overexpression on hippocampal-dependent learning and synaptic efficacy have not been investigated. In the present study, we employed electrophysiological approaches in combination with behavioral analysis to examine hippocampal function of TERT transgenic (TERT-tg) mice and FVB controls. We found that TERT overexpression results in enhanced hippocampal excitation with no changes in inhibition and significantly impairs long-term synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, the expression levels of phosphorylated CREB and phosphory-lated CaMKIIα were significantly decreased while the expression level of CaMKIIα was slightly increased in the hippocampus of TERT-overexpressing mice. Our observations highlight the importance of TERT in normal synaptic function and behavior and provide additional information on a novel animal model of ASD associated with TERT overexpression.

Abstract: Summary
We investigated relationships among immune, metabolic, and sleep abnormalities in mice with non-metastatic mammary cancer. Tumor-bearing mice displayed interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated peripheral inflammation, coincident with altered hepatic glucose processing and sleep. Tumor-bearing mice were hyperphagic, had reduced serum leptin concentrations, and enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ghrelin. We tested whether these phenotypes were driven by inflammation using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6; despite the reduction in IL-6 signaling, metabolic and sleep abnormalities persisted. We next investigated neural populations coupling metabolism and sleep, and observed altered activity within lateral-hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin (HO) neurons. We used a dual HO-receptor antagonist to test whether increased HO signaling was causing metabolic abnormalities. This approach rescued metabolic abnormalities and enhanced sleep quality in tumor-bearing mice. Peripheral sympathetic denervation prevented tumor-induced increases in serum glucose. Our results link metabolic and sleep abnormalities via the HO system, and provide evidence that central neuromodulators contribute to tumor-induced changes in metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
During decision making, hippocampal activity encodes information sometimes about present and sometimes about potential future plans. The mechanisms underlying this transition remain unknown. Building on the evidence that gamma oscillations at different frequencies (low gamma [LG], 30–55 Hz; high gamma [HG], 60–90 Hz; and epsilon, 100–140 Hz) reflect inputs from different circuits, we identified how changes in those frequencies reflect different information-processing states. Using a unique noradrenergic manipulation by clonidine, which shifted both neural representations and gamma states, we found that future representations depended on gamma components. These changes were identifiable on each cycle of theta as asymmetries in the theta cycle, which arose from changes within the ratio of LG and HG power and the underlying phases of those gamma rhythms within the theta cycle. These changes in asymmetry of the theta cycle reflected changes in representations of present and future on each theta cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanisms that control human cardiomyocyte proliferation might be applicable to regenerative medicine. We screened a whole genome collection of human miRNAs, identifying 96 to be capable of increasing proliferation (DNA synthesis and cytokinesis) of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Chemical screening and computational approaches indicated that most of these miRNAs (67) target different components of the Hippo pathway and that their activity depends on the nuclear translocation of the Hippo transcriptional effector YAP. 53 of the 67 miRNAs are present in human iPSC cardiomyocytes, yet anti-miRNA screening revealed that none are individually essential for basal proliferation of hiPSC cardiomyocytes despite the importance of YAP for proliferation. We propose a model in which multiple endogenous miRNAs redundantly suppress Hippo signaling to sustain the cell cycle of immature cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are selectively active in cells with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRD) caused by mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and other pathway members. We sought small molecules that induce HRD in HR-competent cells to induce synthetic lethality with PARPi and extend the utility of PARPi. We demonstrated that inhibition of bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4) induced HRD and sensitized cells across multiple tumor lineages to PARPi regardless of BRCA1/2, TP53, RAS, or BRAF mutation status through depletion of the DNA double-stand break resection protein CtIP (C-terminal binding protein interacting protein). Importantly, BRD4 inhibitor (BRD4i) treatment reversed multiple mechanisms of resistance to PARPi. Furthermore, PARPi and BRD4i are synergistic in multiple in vivo models.

Abstract: Summary
Due to their specificity, efficiency, and ease of programming, CRISPR-associated nucleases are popular tools for genome editing. On the genomic scale, these nucleases still show considerable off-target activity though, posing a serious obstacle to the development of therapies. Off targeting is often minimized by choosing especially high-specificity guide sequences, based on algorithms that codify empirically determined off-targeting rules. A lack of mechanistic understanding of these rules has so far necessitated their ad hoc implementation, likely contributing to the limited precision of present algorithms. To understand the targeting rules, we kinetically model the physics of guide-target hybrid formation. Using only four parameters, our model elucidates the kinetic origin of the experimentally observed off-targeting rules, thereby rationalizing the results from both binding and cleavage assays. We favorably compare our model to published data from CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cpf1, CRISPR-Cascade, as well as the human Argonaute 2 system.

Abstract: Summary
With the use of a mouse model expressing human Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs), we demonstrated that antibodies with isotypes equivalent to ipilimumab and tremelimumab mediate intra-tumoral regulatory T (Treg) cell depletion in vivo, increasing the CD8+ to Treg cell ratio and promoting tumor rejection. Antibodies with improved FcγR binding profiles drove superior anti-tumor responses and survival. In patients with advanced melanoma, response to ipilimumab was associated with the CD16a-V158F high affinity polymorphism. Such activity only appeared relevant in the context of inflamed tumors, explaining the modest response rates observed in the clinical setting. Our data suggest that the activity of anti-CTLA-4 in inflamed tumors may be improved through enhancement of FcγR binding, whereas poorly infiltrated tumors will likely require combination approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) adaptively transfers energy from glucose and fat into heat by inducing a gene network that uncouples mitochondrial electron transport. However, the innate transcription factors that enable the rapid adaptive response of BAT are unclear. Here, we identify estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ) as a critical factor for maintaining BAT identity. ERRγ is selectively expressed in BAT versus WAT, in which, in the absence of PGC1α, it drives a signature transcriptional network of thermogenic and oxidative genes in the basal (i.e., thermoneutral) state. Mice lacking ERRγ in adipose tissue (ERRγKO mice) display marked downregulation of BAT-selective genes that leads to a pronounced whitening of BAT. Consistent with the transcriptional changes, the thermogenic capacity of ERRγKO mice is severely blunted, such that they fail to survive an acute cold challenge. These findings reveal a role for ERRγ as a critical thermoneutral maintenance factor required to prime BAT for thermogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The immunopathology caused by schistosome helminths varies greatly in humans and among mouse strains. A severe form of parasite egg-induced hepatic granulomatous inflammation, seen in CBA mice, is driven by Th17 cells stimulated by IL-1β and IL-23 produced by dendritic cells that express CD209a (SIGNR5), a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) related to human DC-SIGN. Here, we show that CD209a-deficient CBA mice display decreased Th17 responses and are protected from severe immunopathology. In vitro, CD209a augments the egg-induced IL-1β and IL-23 production initiated by the related CLRs Dectin-2 and Mincle. While Dectin-2 and Mincle trigger an FcRγ-dependent signaling cascade that involves the tyrosine kinase Syk and the trimolecular Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 complex, CD209a promotes the sustained activation of Raf-1. Our findings demonstrate that CD209a drives severe Th17 cell-mediated immunopathology in a helminthic disease based on synergy between DC-SIGN- and Dectin-2-related CLRs.

Abstract: Summary
While the majority of phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PI-4, 5-P2) in mammalian cells is generated by the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI-4-P) to PI-4, 5-P2, a small fraction can be made by phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI-5-P). The physiological relevance of this second pathway is not clear. Here, we show that deletion of the genes encoding the two most active enzymes in this pathway, Pip4k2a and Pip4k2b, in the liver of mice causes a large enrichment in lipid droplets and in autophagic vesicles during fasting. These changes are due to a defect in the clearance of autophagosomes that halts autophagy and reduces the supply of nutrients salvaged through this pathway. Similar defects in autophagy are seen in nutrient-starved Pip4k2a−/−Pip4k2b−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in C. elegans lacking the PI5P4K ortholog. These results suggest that this alternative pathway for PI-4, 5-P2 synthesis evolved, in part, to enhance the ability of multicellular organisms to survive starvation.

Abstract: Summary
Neurogenesis continues in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of the adult forebrain from quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs). V-SVZ NSCs are a reservoir for new olfactory bulb (OB) neurons that migrate through the rostral migratory stream (RMS). To generate neurons, V-SVZ NSCs need to activate and enter the cell cycle. The mechanisms underlying NSC transition from quiescence to activity are poorly understood. We show that Notch2, but not Notch1, signaling conveys quiescence to V-SVZ NSCs by repressing cell-cycle-related genes and neurogenesis. Loss of Notch2 activates quiescent NSCs, which proliferate and generate new neurons of the OB lineage. Notch2 deficiency results in accelerated V-SVZ NSC exhaustion and an aging-like phenotype. Simultaneous loss of Notch1 and Notch2 resembled the total loss of Rbpj-mediated canonical Notch signaling; thus, Notch2 functions are not compensated in NSCs, and Notch2 is indispensable for the maintenance of NSC quiescence in the adult V-SVZ.

Abstract: Summary
Patterning of vertebrate melanophores is essential for mate selection and protection from UV-induced damage. Patterning can be influenced by circulating long-range factors, such as hormones, but it is unclear how their activity is controlled in recipient cells to prevent excesses in cell number and migration. The zebrafish wanderlust mutant harbors a mutation in the sheddase bace2 and exhibits hyperdendritic and hyperproliferative melanophores that localize to aberrant sites. We performed a chemical screen to identify suppressors of the wanderlust phenotype and found that inhibition of insulin/PI3Kγ/mTOR signaling rescues the defect. In normal physiology, Bace2 cleaves the insulin receptor, whereas its loss results in hyperactive insulin/PI3K/mTOR signaling. Insulin B, an isoform enriched in the head, drives the melanophore defect. These results suggest that insulin signaling is negatively regulated by melanophore-specific expression of a sheddase, highlighting how long-distance factors can be regulated in a cell-type-specific manner.

Abstract: Summary
The inflammatory response mediated by nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling is essential for host defense against pathogens. Although the regulatory mechanism of NF-κB signaling has been well studied, the molecular basis for epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory response is poorly understood. Here we identify a new signaling axis of PKCα-LSD1-NF-κB, which is critical for activation and amplification of the inflammatory response. In response to excessive inflammatory stimuli, PKCα translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates LSD1. LSD1 phosphorylation is required for p65 binding and facilitates p65 demethylation, leading to enhanced stability. In vivo genetic analysis using Lsd1SA/SA mice with ablation of LSD1 phosphorylation and chemical approaches in wild-type mice with inhibition of PKCα or LSD1 activity show attenuated sepsis-induced inflammatory lung injury and mortality. Together, we demonstrate that the PKCα-LSD1-NF-κB signaling cascade is crucial for epigenetic control of the inflammatory response, and targeting this signaling could be a powerful therapeutic strategy for systemic inflammatory diseases, including sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
Late-onset sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, but its origin remains poorly understood. The Bmi1/Ring1 protein complex maintains transcriptional repression of developmental genes through histone H2A mono-ubiquitination, and Bmi1 deficiency in mice results in growth retardation, progeria, and neurodegeneration. Here, we demonstrate that BMI1 is silenced in AD brains, but not in those with early-onset familial AD, frontotemporal dementia, or Lewy body dementia. BMI1 expression was also reduced in cortical neurons from AD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells but not in neurons overexpressing mutant APP and PSEN1. BMI1 knockout in human post-mitotic neurons resulted in amyloid beta peptide secretion and deposition, p-Tau accumulation, and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, BMI1 was required to repress microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) transcription and prevent GSK3beta and p53 stabilization, which otherwise resulted in neurodegeneration. Restoration of BMI1 activity through genetic or pharmaceutical approaches could represent a therapeutic strategy against AD.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about how variation in sequence composition alters transcription factor occupancy to precisely recruit large transcription complexes. A key model for understanding how transcription complexes are targeted is the Drosophila dosage compensation system in which the male-specific lethal (MSL) transcription complex specifically identifies and regulates the male X chromosome. The chromatin-linked adaptor for MSL proteins (CLAMP) zinc-finger protein targets MSL to the X chromosome but also binds to GA-rich sequence elements throughout the genome. Furthermore, the GAGA-associated factor (GAF) transcription factor also recognizes GA-rich sequences but does not associate with the MSL complex. Here, we demonstrate that MSL complex recruitment sites are optimal CLAMP targets. Specificity for CLAMP binding versus GAF binding is driven by variability in sequence composition within similar GA-rich motifs. Therefore, variation within seemingly similar cis elements drives the context-specific targeting of a large transcription complex.

Abstract: Summary
To understand the mutational burden of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we sequenced genomes of 18 fibroblast-derived iPSC lines and identified different classes of somatic mutations based on structure, origin, and frequency. Copy-number alterations affected 295 kb in each sample and strongly impacted gene expression. UV-damage mutations were present in ∼45% of the iPSCs and accounted for most of the observed heterogeneity in mutation rates across lines. Subclonal mutations (not present in all iPSCs within a line) composed 10% of point mutations and, compared with clonal variants, showed an enrichment in active promoters and increased association with altered gene expression. Our study shows that, by combining WGS, transcriptome, and epigenome data, we can understand the mutational burden of each iPSC line on an individual basis and suggests that this information could be used to prioritize iPSC lines for models of specific human diseases and/or transplantation therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscles undergo atrophy in response to diseases and aging. Here we report that mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) acts as a dominant suppressor of neuromuscular synaptic loss to preserve skeletal muscles. Mfn2 is reduced in spinal cords of transgenic SOD1G93A and aged mice. Through preserving neuromuscular synapses, increasing neuronal Mfn2 prevents skeletal muscle wasting in both SOD1G93A and aged mice, whereas deletion of neuronal Mfn2 produces neuromuscular synaptic dysfunction and skeletal muscle atrophy. Neuromuscular synaptic loss after sciatic nerve transection can also be alleviated by Mfn2. Mfn2 coexists with calpastatin largely in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) to regulate its axonal transport. Genetic inactivation of calpastatin abolishes Mfn2-mediated protection of neuromuscular synapses. Our results suggest that, as a potential key component of a novel and heretofore unrecognized mechanism of cytoplasmic protein transport, Mfn2 may play a general role in preserving neuromuscular synapses and serve as a common therapeutic target for skeletal muscle atrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Picornaviruses have evolved to hijack host cellular machinery, including the autophagic pathway. However, the mechanisms remain largely unclear. We use coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) as a model organism to explore the possible role of picornavirus subversion of the autophagic pathway in viral infection. Our in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that CVB3 infection causes a significant, albeit incomplete, inhibition of autophagic flux by limiting the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and/or late endosomes. Furthermore, we show that CVB3 specifically targets SNARE protein SNAP29 and adaptor protein PLEKHM1, two critical proteins known to regulate autophagosome fusion, for cleavage through the catalytic activity of viral proteinase 3C, ultimately impairing the formation of SNARE complexes. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of SNAP29/PLEKHM1 inhibits autophagic flux, resulting in increased viral replication. Collectively, our study reveals a mechanism that supports an emerging model whereby CVB3 hijacks the autophagic machinery to facilitate its own propagation.

Abstract: Summary
The basolateral amygdala (BLA) mediates associative learning for both fear and reward. Accumulating evidence supports the notion that different BLA projections distinctly alter motivated behavior, including projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), medial aspect of the central amygdala (CeM), and ventral hippocampus (vHPC). Although there is consensus regarding the existence of distinct subsets of BLA neurons encoding positive or negative valence, controversy remains regarding the anatomical arrangement of these populations. First, we map the location of more than 1,000 neurons distributed across the BLA and recorded during a Pavlovian discrimination task. Next, we determine the location of projection-defined neurons labeled with retrograde tracers and use CLARITY to reveal the axonal path in 3-dimensional space. Finally, we examine the local influence of each projection-defined populations within the BLA. Understanding the functional and topographical organization of circuits underlying valence assignment could reveal fundamental principles about emotional processing.

Abstract: Summary
Cone photoreceptors scale dynamically the sensitivity of responses to maintain responsiveness across wide range of changes in luminance. Synaptic changes contribute to this adaptation, but how this process is coordinated at the molecular level is poorly understood. Here, we report that a cell adhesion-like molecule, LRIT1, is enriched selectively at cone photoreceptor synapses where it engages in a trans-synaptic interaction with mGluR6, the principal receptor in postsynaptic ON-bipolar cells. The levels of LRIT1 are regulated by the neurotransmitter release apparatus that controls photoreceptor output. Knockout of LRIT1 in mice increases the sensitivity of cone synaptic signaling while impairing its ability to adapt to background light without overtly influencing the morphology or molecular composition of photoreceptor synapses. Accordingly, mice lacking LRIT1 show visual deficits under conditions requiring temporally challenging discrimination of visual signals in steady background light. These observations reveal molecular mechanisms involved in scaling synaptic communication in the retina.

Abstract: Summary
There is growing interest in pharmacological interventions directly targeting the aging process. Pharmacological interventions against aging should be efficacious when started in adults and, ideally, repurpose existing drugs. We show that dramatic lifespan extension can be achieved by targeting multiple, evolutionarily conserved aging pathways and mechanisms using drug combinations. Using this approach in C. elegans, we were able to slow aging and significantly extend healthy lifespan. To identify the mechanism of these drug synergies, we applied transcriptomics and lipidomics analysis. We found that drug interactions involved the TGF-β pathway and recruited genes related with IGF signaling. daf-2, daf-7, and sbp-1 interact upstream of changes in lipid metabolism, resulting in increased monounsaturated fatty acid content and this is required for healthy lifespan extension. These data suggest that combinations of drugs targeting distinct subsets of the aging gene regulatory network can be leveraged to cause synergistic lifespan benefits.

Abstract: Summary
RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with primary, precursor, and mature microRNAs (miRs) to influence mature miR levels, which in turn affect critical aspects of human development and disease. To understand how RBPs contribute to miR biogenesis, we analyzed human enhanced UV crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) datasets for 126 RBPs to discover miR-encoding genomic loci that are statistically enriched for RBP binding. We find that 92% of RBPs interact directly with at least one miR locus, and that some interactions are cell line specific despite expression of the miR locus in both cell lines evaluated. We validated that ILF3 and BUD13 directly interact with and stabilize miR-144 and that BUD13 suppresses mir-210 processing to the mature species. We also observed that DDX3X regulates primary miR-20a, while LARP4 stabilizes precursor mir-210. Our approach to identifying regulators of miR loci can be applied to any user-defined RNA annotation, thereby guiding the discovery of uncharacterized regulators of RNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
The Golgi apparatus is the central hub for protein trafficking and glycosylation in the secretory pathway. However, how the Golgi responds to glucose deprivation is so far unknown. Here, we report that GRASP55, the Golgi stacking protein located in medial- and trans-Golgi cisternae, is O-GlcNAcylated by the O-GlcNAc transferase OGT under growth conditions. Glucose deprivation reduces GRASP55 O-GlcNAcylation. De-O-GlcNAcylated GRASP55 forms puncta outside of the Golgi area, which co-localize with autophagosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes. GRASP55 depletion reduces autophagic flux and results in autophagosome accumulation, while expression of an O-GlcNAcylation-deficient mutant of GRASP55 accelerates autophagic flux. Biochemically, GRASP55 interacts with LC3-II on the autophagosomes and LAMP2 on late endosomes/lysosomes and functions as a bridge between LC3-II and LAMP2 for autophagosome and lysosome fusion; this function is negatively regulated by GRASP55 O-GlcNAcylation. Therefore, GRASP55 senses glucose levels through O-GlcNAcylation and acts as a tether to facilitate autophagosome maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is crucial for cells to overcome metabolic stress by providing ATP and NADPH. However, the mechanism by which FAO is regulated in tumors remains elusive. Here we show that Nur77 is required for the metabolic adaptation of melanoma cells by protecting FAO. Glucose deprivation activates ERK2 to phosphorylate and induce Nur77 translocation to the mitochondria, where Nur77 binds to TPβ, a rate-limiting enzyme in FAO. Although TPβ activity is normally inhibited by oxidation under glucose deprivation, the Nur77-TPβ association results in Nur77 self-sacrifice to protect TPβ from oxidation. FAO is therefore able to maintain NADPH and ATP levels and prevent ROS increase and cell death. The Nur77-TPβ interaction further promotes melanoma metastasis by facilitating circulating melanoma cell survival. This study demonstrates a novel regulatory function of Nur77 with linkage of the FAO-NADPH-ROS pathway during metabolic stress, suggesting Nur77 as a potential therapeutic target in melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Establishing synaptic contacts between neurons is paramount for nervous system function. This process involves transsynaptic interactions between a host of cell adhesion molecules that act in cooperation with the proteins of the extracellular matrix to specify unique physiological properties of individual synaptic connections. However, understanding of the molecular mechanisms that generate functional diversity in an input-specific fashion is limited. In this study, we identify that major components of the extracellular matrix proteins present in the synaptic cleft—members of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) family—associate with the GPR158/179 group of orphan receptors. Using the mammalian retina as a model system, we demonstrate that the HSPG member Pikachurin, released by photoreceptors, recruits a key post-synaptic signaling complex of downstream ON-bipolar neurons in coordination with the pre-synaptic dystroglycan glycoprotein complex. We further demonstrate that this transsynaptic assembly plays an essential role in synaptic transmission of photoreceptor signals.

Abstract: Summary
The impacts of different macronutrients on body weight regulation remain unresolved, with different studies suggesting increased dietary fat, increased carbohydrates (particularly sugars), or reduced protein may all stimulate overconsumption and drive obesity. We exposed C57BL/6 mice to 29 different diets varying from 8.3% to 80% fat, 10% to 80% carbohydrate, 5% to 30% protein, and 5% to 30% sucrose. Only increased dietary fat content was associated with elevated energy intake and adiposity. This response was associated with increased gene expression in the 5-HT receptors, and the dopamine and opioid signaling pathways in the hypothalamus. We replicated the core findings in four other mouse strains (DBA/2, BALB/c, FVB, and C3H). Mice regulate their food consumption primarily to meet an energy rather than a protein target, but this system can be over-ridden by hedonic factors linked to fat, but not sucrose, consumption.

Abstract: Summary
The role of tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in psychiatric disease is well established, but remains less explored in peripheral tissues. Exercise training activates kynurenine biotransformation in skeletal muscle, which protects from neuroinflammation and leads to peripheral kynurenic acid accumulation. Here we show that kynurenic acid increases energy utilization by activating G protein-coupled receptor Gpr35, which stimulates lipid metabolism, thermogenic, and anti-inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue. This suppresses weight gain in animals fed a high-fat diet and improves glucose tolerance. Kynurenic acid and Gpr35 enhance Pgc-1α1 expression and cellular respiration, and increase the levels of Rgs14 in adipocytes, which leads to enhanced beta-adrenergic receptor signaling. Conversely, genetic deletion of Gpr35 causes progressive weight gain and glucose intolerance, and sensitizes to the effects of high-fat diets. Finally, exercise-induced adipose tissue browning is compromised in Gpr35 knockout animals. This work uncovers kynurenine metabolism as a pathway with therapeutic potential to control energy homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Paralogous transcription factors (TFs) are oftentimes reported to have identical DNA-binding motifs, despite the fact that they perform distinct regulatory functions. Differential genomic targeting by paralogous TFs is generally assumed to be due to interactions with protein co-factors or the chromatin environment. Using a computational-experimental framework called iMADS (integrative modeling and analysis of differential specificity), we show that, contrary to previous assumptions, paralogous TFs bind differently to genomic target sites even in vitro. We used iMADS to quantify, model, and analyze specificity differences between 11 TFs from 4 protein families. We found that paralogous TFs have diverged mainly at medium- and low-affinity sites, which are poorly captured by current motif models. We identify sequence and shape features differentially preferred by paralogous TFs, and we show that the intrinsic differences in specificity among paralogous TFs contribute to their differential in vivo binding. Thus, our study represents a step forward in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of differential specificity in TF families.

Abstract: Summary
The gonad is a unique biological system for studying cell-fate decisions. However, major questions remain regarding the identity of somatic progenitor cells and the transcriptional events driving cell differentiation. Using time-series single-cell RNA sequencing on XY mouse gonads during sex determination, we identified a single population of somatic progenitor cells prior to sex determination. A subset of these progenitors differentiates into Sertoli cells, a process characterized by a highly dynamic genetic program consisting of sequential waves of gene expression. Another subset of multipotent cells maintains their progenitor state but undergoes significant transcriptional changes restricting their competence toward a steroidogenic fate required for the differentiation of fetal Leydig cells. Our findings confirm the presence of a unique multipotent progenitor population in the gonadal primordium that gives rise to both supporting and interstitial lineages. These also provide the most granular analysis of the transcriptional events occurring during testicular cell-fate commitment.

Abstract: Summary
The root stem cell niche, which is composed of four mitotically inactive quiescent center (QC) cells and the surrounding actively divided stem cells in Arabidopsis, is critical for growth and root development. Here, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis prohibitin protein PHB3 is required for the maintenance of root stem cell niche identity by both inhibiting proliferative processes in the QC and stimulating cell division in the proximal meristem (PM). PHB3 coordinates cell division and differentiation in the root apical meristem by restricting the spatial expression of ethylene response factor (ERF) transcription factors 115, 114, and 109. ERF115, ERF114, and ERF109 mediate ROS signaling, in a PLT-independent manner, to control root stem cell niche maintenance and root growth through phytosulfokine (PSK) peptide hormones in Arabidopsis.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells exploit the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program to become metastatic. Cytoskeletal regulators are required in mesenchymal cells where they promote EMT and EMT-induced migration. In a search for regulators of metastasis, we conducted shRNA screens targeting the microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs). We show that the +TIP ACF7 is essential both for the maintenance of the EMT program and to promote migration. We find that the E3 ubiquitin ligase HectD1 promotes ACF7-proteasome-mediated degradation. Depletion of HectD1 stabilized ACF7, and this enhanced EMT and migration. Decreased HectD1 expression increased metastases in mouse models and conferred increased resistance to the cytotoxic drug cisplatin. A retrospective analysis of biopsies from breast cancer patients also reveals a correlation between higher ACF7 or lower HectD1 expression with poor clinical outcomes. Together, these results suggest that the control of ACF7 levels by HectD1 modulates EMT and the efficiency of metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
It remains unknown if mitochondrial bioenergetics are altered with aging in humans. We established an in vitro method to simultaneously determine mitochondrial respiration and H2O2 emission in skeletal muscle tissue across a range of biologically relevant ADP concentrations. Using this approach, we provide evidence that, although the capacity for mitochondrial H2O2 emission is not increased with aging, mitochondrial ADP sensitivity is impaired. This resulted in an increase in mitochondrial H2O2 and the fraction of electron leak to H2O2, in the presence of virtually all ADP concentrations examined. Moreover, although prolonged resistance training in older individuals increased muscle mass, strength, and maximal mitochondrial respiration, exercise training did not alter H2O2 emission rates in the presence of ADP, the fraction of electron leak to H2O2, or the redox state of the muscle. These data establish that a reduction in mitochondrial ADP sensitivity increases mitochondrial H2O2 emission and contributes to age-associated redox stress.

Abstract: Summary
In Alzheimer’s disease, neurofibrillary tangle pathology appears to spread along neuronal connections, proposed to be mediated by the release and uptake of abnormal, disease-specific forms of microtubule-binding protein tau MAPT. It is currently unclear whether transfer of tau between neurons is a toxic gain-of-function process in dementia or reflects a constitutive biological process. We report two entry mechanisms for monomeric tau to human neurons: a rapid dynamin-dependent phase typical of endocytosis and a second, slower actin-dependent phase of macropinocytosis. Aggregated tau entry is independent of actin polymerization and largely dynamin dependent, consistent with endocytosis and distinct from macropinocytosis, the major route for aggregated tau entry reported for non-neuronal cells. Anti-tau antibodies abrogate monomeric tau entry into neurons, but less efficiently in the case of aggregated tau, where internalized tau carries antibody with it into neurons. These data suggest that tau entry to human neurons is a physiological process and not a disease-specific phenomenon.

Abstract: Summary
How growing cells cope with size expansion while ensuring mechanical integrity is not known. In walled cells, such as those of microbes and plants, growth and viability are both supported by a thin and rigid encasing cell wall (CW). We deciphered the dynamic mechanisms controlling wall surface assembly during cell growth, using a sub-resolution microscopy approach to monitor CW thickness in live rod-shaped fission yeast cells. We found that polar cell growth yielded wall thinning and that thickness negatively influenced growth. Thickness at growing tips exhibited a fluctuating behavior with thickening phases followed by thinning phases, indicative of a delayed feedback promoting thickness homeostasis. This feedback was mediated by mechanosensing through the CW integrity pathway, which probes strain in the wall to adjust synthase localization and activity to surface growth. Mutants defective in thickness homeostasis lysed by rupturing the wall, demonstrating its pivotal role for walled cell survival.

Abstract: Summary
The early midgut undergoes intensive elongation, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are unknown. The early midgut epithelium is pseudostratified, and its nuclei travel between apical and basal surfaces in concert with cell cycle. Using 3D confocal imaging and 2D live imaging, we profiled behaviors of individual dividing cells. As nuclei migrate apically for mitosis, cells maintain a basal process (BP), which splits but is inherited by only one daughter. After mitosis, some daughters directly use the inherited BP as a “conduit” to transport the nucleus basally, while >50% of daughters generate a new basal filopodium and use it as a path to return the nucleus. Post-mitotic filopodial “pathfinding” is guided by mesenchymal WNT5A. Without WNT5A, some cells fail to tether basally and undergo apoptosis, leading to a shortened midgut. Thus, these studies reveal previously unrecognized strategies for efficient post-mitotic nuclear trafficking, which is critical for early midgut elongation.

Abstract: Summary
R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures found abundantly and yet often viewed as by-products of transcription. Studying cells from patients with a motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 4 [ALS4]) caused by a mutation in senataxin, we uncovered how R-loops promote transcription. In ALS4 patients, the senataxin mutation depletes R-loops with a consequent effect on gene expression. With fewer R-loops in ALS4 cells, the expression of BAMBI, a negative regulator of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), is reduced; that then leads to the activation of the TGF-β pathway. We uncovered that genome-wide R-loops influence promoter methylation of over 1,200 human genes. DNA methyl-transferase 1 favors binding to double-stranded DNA over R-loops. Thus, in forming R-loops, nascent RNA blocks DNA methylation and promotes further transcription. Hence, our results show that nucleic acid structures, in addition to sequences, influence the binding and activity of regulatory proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which stem cell (SC) quiescence is regulated to allow normal regeneration are poorly understood. Here, we show that the mesenchymal niche of the hair follicle, the dermal papilla (DP), governs the properties of quiescent SCs in the bulge despite its relatively distant location. The DP induces regeneration by downregulating bulge-dependent inhibitory effects that restrain the intrinsic proliferation features of primed progenitors. Once regeneration initiates, the DP orchestrates Shh expression in primed-progenitor descendants by an autoregulatory circuit to restrict Shh expression to the DP vicinity and to confine Shh levels to act only on nearby cells. As the DP moves away from the bulge, quiescent SCs are exposed to Shh transiently. This ensures a short period of quiescent SC activation required for normal regeneration. Furthermore, our findings show that Shh signaling in the DP fine-tunes Wnt signaling activity and reveal the importance of signaling cross talk in coordinating regeneration pace.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer is mostly incurable when diagnosed at a metastatic stage, making its early detection via blood proteins of immense clinical interest. Proteomic changes in tumor tissue may lead to changes detectable in the protein composition of circulating blood plasma. Using a proteomic workflow combining N-glycosite enrichment and SWATH mass spectrometry, we generate a data resource of 284 blood samples derived from patients with different types of localized-stage carcinomas and from matched controls. We observe whether the changes in the patient’s plasma are specific to a particular carcinoma or represent a generic signature of proteins modified uniformly in a common, systemic response to many cancers. A quantitative comparison of the resulting N-glycosite profiles discovers that proteins related to blood platelets are common to several cancers (e.g., THBS1), whereas others are highly cancer-type specific. Available proteomics data, including a SWATH library to study N-glycoproteins, will facilitate follow-up biomarker research into early cancer detection.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian genomes are promiscuously transcribed, yielding protein-coding and non-coding products. Many transcripts are short lived due to their nuclear degradation by the ribonucleolytic RNA exosome. Here, we show that abolished nuclear exosome function causes the formation of distinct nuclear foci, containing polyadenylated (pA+) RNA secluded from nucleocytoplasmic export. We asked whether exosome co-factors could serve such nuclear retention. Co-localization studies revealed the enrichment of pA+ RNA foci with “pA-tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection” components MTR4, ZFC3H1, and PABPN1 but no overlap with known nuclear structures such as Cajal bodies, speckles, paraspeckles, or nucleoli. Interestingly, ZFC3H1 is required for foci formation, and in its absence, selected pA+ RNAs, including coding and non-coding transcripts, are exported to the cytoplasm in a process dependent on the mRNA export factor AlyREF. Our results establish ZFC3H1 as a central nuclear pA+ RNA retention factor, counteracting nuclear export activity.

Abstract: Summary
Class switch recombination (CSR) is a DNA recombination reaction that diversifies the effector component of antibody responses. CSR is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which targets transcriptionally active immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) switch donor and acceptor DNA. The 3′ Igh super-enhancer, 3′ regulatory region (3′RR), is essential for acceptor region transcription, but how this function is regulated is unknown. Here, we identify the chromatin reader ZMYND8 as an essential regulator of the 3′RR. In B cells, ZMYND8 binds promoters and super-enhancers, including the Igh enhancers. ZMYND8 controls the 3′RR activity by modulating the enhancer transcriptional status. In its absence, there is increased 3′RR polymerase loading and decreased acceptor region transcription and CSR. In addition to CSR, ZMYND8 deficiency impairs somatic hypermutation (SHM) of Igh, which is also dependent on the 3′RR. Thus, ZMYND8 controls Igh diversification in mature B lymphocytes by regulating the activity of the 3′ Igh super-enhancer.

Abstract: Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCX) mediate bidirectional Ca2+ fluxes across cell membranes and contribute to Ca2+ homeostasis in many cell types. Exchangers are regulated by gating reactions that depend on Na+ and Ca2+ binding to transport and regulatory sites. A Na+i-dependent inactivation is prominent in all isoforms, whereas Ca2+i-dependent regulation varies among isoforms. Here we characterize new details of NCX operation and describe differences and similarities between NCX3 and NCX1 regulation by intracellular Ca2+ and ATP. To compare isoforms, we employed BHK cells expressing NCX3 or NCX1 constitutively and exchange activity was analysed in whole-cell and excised patch recordings under “zero-trans” conditions (i.e., with only one transported ion species on each side). Using BHK cells with low cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering, outward (reverse) currents, reflecting Ca2+ influx, are activated by applying extracellular Ca2+ (Cao) in the presence of Na+ on the cytoplasmic side. When firstly activated, peak outward NCX3 currents rapidly decay over seconds and then typically develop a secondary transient peak with slower kinetics, until Cao removal abolishes all outward current. The delayed rise of outward current is the signature of an activating process since peak outward NCX3 currents elicited at subsequent Cao bouts remain stimulated for minutes and slower decline towards a non-zero level during continued Cao application. Secondary transient peaks and current stimulation are suppressed by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ buffer capacity or by replacing cytoplasmic ATP with the analogues AMP-PNP or ATPγS. In BHK cells expressing NCX1, outward currents activated under identical settings decay to a steady-state level during single Cao application and are significantly larger, causing strong and long-lived run down of subsequent outward currents. NCX1 current run down is not prevented by increasing cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering but secondary transient peaks in the outward current profile can be resolved in the presence of ATP. Finally, inward currents recorded in patches excised from NCX3-expressing cells reveal a proteolysis-sensitive, Ca-dependent inactivation process that is unusual for NCX1 forward activity. Together, our results suggest that NCX function is regulated more richly than appreciated heretofore, possibly including processes that are lost in excised membrane patches.

Abstract: Animals use their odorant receptors to receive chemical information from the environment. Insect odorant receptors differ from the G protein-coupled odorant receptors in vertebrates and nematodes, and very little is known about their protein–protein interactions. Here, we introduce a mass spectrometric platform designed for the large-scale analysis of insect odorant receptor protein–protein interactions. Using this platform, we obtained the first Orco interactome from Drosophila melanogaster. From a total of 1,186 identified proteins, we narrowed the interaction candidates to 226, of which only two-thirds have been named. These candidates include the known olfactory proteins Or92a and Obp51a. Around 90% of the proteins having published names likely function inside the cell, and nearly half of these intracellular proteins are associated with the endomembrane system. In a basic loss-of-function electrophysiological screen, we found that the disruption of eight (i.e., Rab5, CG32795, Mpcp, Tom70, Vir-1, CG30427, Eaat1, and CG2781) of 28 randomly selected candidates affects olfactory responses in vivo. Thus, because this Orco interactome includes physiologically meaningful candidates, we anticipate that our platform will help guide further research on the molecular mechanisms of the insect odorant receptor family.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor metabolism is reorganized to support proliferation in the face of growth-related stress. Unlike the widespread profiling of changes to metabolic enzyme levels in cancer, comparatively less attention has been paid to the substrates/products of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, small-molecule metabolites. We developed an informatic pipeline to concurrently analyze metabolomics data from over 900 tissue samples spanning seven cancer types, revealing extensive heterogeneity in metabolic changes relative to normal tissue across cancers of different tissues of origin. Despite this heterogeneity, a number of metabolites were recurrently differentially abundant across many cancers, such as lactate and acyl-carnitine species. Through joint analysis of metabolomic data alongside clinical features of patient samples, we also identified a small number of metabolites, including several polyamines and kynurenine, which were associated with aggressive tumors across several tumor types. Our findings offer a glimpse onto common patterns of metabolic reprogramming across cancers, and the work serves as a large-scale resource accessible via a web application (http://www.sanderlab.org/pancanmet).

Actin Dysfunction Induces Cell Cycle Delay at G2/M with Sustained ERK and RSK Activation in IMR-90 Normal Human Fibroblasts,

Abstract: The actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in the entry of mitosis as well as in cytokinesis. In a previous study, we showed that actin disruption delays mitotic entry at G2/M by sustained activation of extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in primary cells but not in transformed cancer cell lines. Here, we examined the mechanism of cell cycle delay at G2/M by actin dysfunction in IMR-90 normal human fibroblasts. We observed that de-polymerization of actin with cytochalasin D (CD) constitutively activated ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and induced inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 (Tyr 15) in IMR-90 cells. In the presence of an actin defect in IMR-90 cells, activating phosphorylation of Wee1 kinase (Ser 642) and inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc25C (Ser 216) was also maintained. However, when kinase-dead RSK (DN-RSK) was over-expressed, we observed sustained activation of ERK1/2, but no delay in the G2/M transition, demonstrating that RSK functions downstream of ERK in cell cycle delay by actin dysfunction. In DN-RSK overexpressing IMR-90 cells treated with CD, phosphorylation of Cdc25C (Ser 216) was blocked and phosphorylation of Cdc2 (Tyr 15) was decreased, but the phosphorylation of Wee1 (Ser 642) was maintained, demonstrating that RSK directly controls phosphorylation of Cdc25C (Ser 216), but not the activity of Wee1. These results strongly suggest that actin dysfunction in primary cells activates ERK1/2 to inhibit Cdc2, delaying the cell cycle at G2/M by activating downstream RSK, which phosphorylates and blocks Cdc25C, and by directly activating Wee1.

Abstract: Summary
Most colorectal cancer (CRC)-related deaths are due to liver metastases. PKCζ is a tumor suppressor in CRC with reduced expression in metastasis. Given the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating cellular plasticity, we performed an unbiased screening and identified the miR-200 family as the most relevant miRNAs downregulated by PKCζ deficiency. The regulation of the intracellular levels of miR-200 by PKCζ is post-transcriptional and involves their secretion in extracellular vesicles. Here, we identified ADAR2 as a direct substrate of PKCζ in CRC cells. Phosphorylation of ADAR2 regulates its editing activity, which is required to maintain miR-200 steady-state levels, suggesting that the PKCζ/ADAR2 axis regulates miR-200 secretion through RNA editing. Loss of this axis results in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased liver metastases, which can be inhibited in vivo by blocking miR-200 release. Therefore, the PKCζ/ADAR2 axis is a critical regulator of CRC metastases through modulation of miR-200 levels.

Abstract: Summary
Disparities in cancer care have been a long-standing challenge. We estimated the genetic ancestry of The Cancer Genome Atlas patients, and performed a pan-cancer analysis on the influence of genetic ancestry on genomic alterations. Compared with European Americans, African Americans (AA) with breast, head and neck, and endometrial cancers exhibit a higher level of chromosomal instability, while a lower level of chromosomal instability was observed in AAs with kidney cancers. The frequencies of TP53 mutations and amplification of CCNE1 were increased in AAs in the cancer types showing higher levels of chromosomal instability. We observed lower frequencies of genomic alterations affecting genes in the PI3K pathway in AA patients across cancers. Our result provides insight into genomic contribution to cancer disparities.

Abstract: Summary
The spike trains of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the only source of visual information to the brain. Here, we genetically identify an RGC type in mice that functions as a pixel encoder and increases firing to light increments (PixON-RGC). PixON-RGCs have medium-sized dendritic arbors and non-canonical center-surround receptive fields. From their receptive field center, PixON-RGCs receive only excitatory input, which encodes contrast and spatial information linearly. From their receptive field surround, PixON-RGCs receive only inhibitory input, which is temporally matched to the excitatory center input. As a result, the firing rate of PixON-RGCs linearly encodes local image contrast. Spatially offset (i.e., truly lateral) inhibition of PixON-RGCs arises from spiking GABAergic amacrine cells. The receptive field organization of PixON-RGCs is independent of stimulus wavelength (i.e., achromatic). PixON-RGCs project predominantly to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus and likely contribute to visual perception.

Abstract: Summary
Phagocyte microbiocidal mechanisms and inflammatory cytokine production are temporally coordinated, although their respective interdependencies remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify a nitric-oxide-mediated antioxidant response as a negative feedback regulator of inflammatory cytokine production in phagocytes. In this context, Keap1 functions as a cellular redox sensor that responds to elevated reactive nitrogen intermediates by eliciting an adaptive transcriptional program controlled by Nrf2 and comprised of antioxidant genes, including Prdx5. We demonstrate that engaging the antioxidant response is sufficient to suppress Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production in dendritic cells and that Prdx5 is required for attenuation of inflammatory cytokine production. Collectively, these findings delineate the reciprocal regulation of inflammation and cellular redox systems in myeloid cells.

Abstract: Summary
As animals mature from embryonic to adult stages, the skin grows and acquires specialized appendages, like hairs, feathers, and scales. How cutaneous blood vessels and sensory axons adapt to these dramatic changes is poorly understood. By characterizing skin maturation in zebrafish, we discovered that sensory axons are delivered to the adult epidermis in organized nerves patterned by features in bony scales. These nerves associate with blood vessels and osteoblasts above scales. Osteoblasts create paths in scales that independently guide nerves and blood vessels during both development and regeneration. By preventing scale regeneration and examining mutants lacking scales, we found that scales recruit, organize, and polarize axons and blood vessels to evenly distribute them in the skin. These studies uncover mechanisms for achieving comprehensive innervation and vascularization of the adult skin and suggest that scales coordinate a metamorphosis-like transformation of the skin with sensory axon and vascular remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Cytokinesis failure may result in the formation of polyploid cells, and subsequent mitosis can lead to aneuploidy and tumor formation. Tumor suppressor mechanisms limiting the oncogenic potential of these cells have been described. However, the universal applicability of these tumor-suppressive barriers remains controversial. Here, we use Drosophila epithelial cells to investigate the consequences of cytokinesis failure in vivo. We report that cleavage defects trigger the activation of the JNK pathway, leading to downregulation of the inhibitor of apoptosis DIAP1 and programmed cell death. Yorkie overcomes the tumor-suppressive role of JNK and induces neoplasia. Yorkie regulates the cell cycle phosphatase Cdc25/string, which drives tumorigenesis in a context of cytokinesis failure. These results highlight the functional significance of the JNK pathway in epithelial cells with defective cytokinesis and elucidate a mechanism used by emerging tumor cells to bypass this tumor-suppressive barrier and develop into tumors.

Abstract: Elevation of Ca2+i and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are considered as major signals triggering transcriptomic changes in exercising skeletal muscle. Electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) of cultured myotubes is widely employed as an in vitro model of muscle contraction. This study examines the impact of Ca2+i-mediated and Ca2+i-independent signaling in transcriptomic changes in EPS-treated C2C12 myotubes. Electrical pulse stimulation (40 V, 1 Hz, 10 ms, 2 h) resulted in [Ca2+]i oscillations, gain of Na+i, loss of K+i, and differential expression of 3215 transcripts. Additions of 10 μM nicardipine abolished [Ca2+]i oscillations but did not affect elevation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio seen in EPS-treated myotubes. Differential expression of 1018 transcripts was preserved in the presence of nicardipine, indicating a Ca2+i-independent mechanism of excitation–transcription coupling. Among nicardipine-resistant transcripts, we noted 113 transcripts whose expression was also affected by partial Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition with 30 μM ouabain providing the same elevation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio as in EPS-treated cells. Electrical pulse stimulation increased phosphorylation of CREB, ATF-1, Akt, ERK, and p38 MAPK without any impact on phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase-1, i.e. downstream markers of AMPK activation. Unlike CREB, ATF-1, and MAPKs, an increment in Akt phosphorylation was abolished by nicardipine. Thus, our results show that Ca2+i-independent signaling plays a key role in altered expression of 30% of studied genes in EPS-treated myotubes. This signaling pathway is at least partially triggered by dissipation of transmembrane gradients of monovalent cations.

Abstract: Summary
While Slicer activity of Argonaute is central to RNAi, conserved roles of slicing in endogenous regulatory biology are less clear, especially in mammals. Biogenesis of erythroid Dicer-independent mir-451 involves Ago2 catalysis, but mir-451-KO mice do not phenocopy Ago2 catalytic-dead (Ago2-CD) mice, suggesting other needs for slicing. Here, we reveal mir-486 as another dominant erythroid miRNA with atypical biogenesis. While it is Dicer dependent, it requires slicing to eliminate its star strand. Thus, in Ago2-CD conditions, miR-486-5p is functionally inactive due to duplex arrest. Genome-wide analyses reveal miR-486 and miR-451 as the major slicing-dependent miRNAs in the hematopoietic system. Moreover, mir-486-KO mice exhibit erythroid defects, and double knockout of mir-486/451 phenocopies the cell-autonomous effects of Ago2-CD in the hematopoietic system. Finally, we observe that Ago2 is the dominant-expressed Argonaute in maturing erythroblasts, reflecting a specialized environment for processing slicing-dependent miRNAs. Overall, the mammalian hematopoietic system has evolved multiple conserved requirements for Slicer-dependent miRNA biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Given its role as the source of definitive hematopoietic cells, we sought to determine whether mutations initiated in the hemogenic endothelium would yield hematopoietic abnormalities or malignancies. Here, we find that endothelium-specific transposon mutagenesis in mice promotes hematopoietic pathologies that are both myeloid and lymphoid in nature. Frequently mutated genes included previously recognized cancer drivers and additional candidates, such as Pi4ka, a lipid kinase whose mutation was found to promote myeloid and erythroid dysfunction. Subsequent validation experiments showed that targeted inactivation of the Pi4ka catalytic domain or reduction in mRNA expression inhibited myeloid and erythroid cell differentiation in vitro and promoted anemia in vivo through a mechanism involving deregulation of AKT, MAPK, SRC, and JAK-STAT signaling. Finally, we provide evidence linking PI4KAP2, previously considered a pseudogene, to human myeloid and erythroid leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Heterotypic cellular and molecular interactions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) control cancer progression. Here, we show that CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer (iNKT) cells control prostate cancer (PCa) progression by sculpting the TME. In a mouse PCa model, iNKT cells restrained the pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive capabilities of tumor-infiltrating immune cells by reducing pro-angiogenic TIE2+, M2-like macrophages (TEMs), and sustaining pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages. iNKT cells directly contacted macrophages in the PCa stroma, and iNKT cell transfer into tumor-bearing mice abated TEMs, delaying tumor progression. iNKT cells modulated macrophages through the cooperative engagement of CD1d, Fas, and CD40, which promoted selective killing of M2-like and survival of M1-like macrophages. Human PCa aggressiveness associate with reduced intra-tumoral iNKT cells, increased TEMs, and expression of pro-angiogenic genes, underscoring the clinical significance of this crosstalk. Therefore, iNKT cells may control PCa through mechanisms involving differential macrophage modulation, which may be harnessed for therapeutically reprogramming the TME.

Abstract: Summary
X-linked hyper-immunoglobulin M (hyper-IgM) syndrome (XHIM) is a primary immunodeficiency due to mutations in CD40 ligand that affect immunoglobulin class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. The disease is amenable to gene therapy using retroviral vectors, but dysregulated gene expression results in abnormal lymphoproliferation in mouse models, highlighting the need for alternative strategies. Here, we demonstrate the ability of both the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) platforms to efficiently drive integration of a normal copy of the CD40L cDNA delivered by Adeno-Associated Virus. Site-specific insertion of the donor sequence downstream of the endogenous CD40L promoter maintained physiologic expression of CD40L while overriding all reported downstream mutations. High levels of gene modification were achieved in primary human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as well as in cell lines and XHIM-patient-derived T cells. Notably, gene-corrected HSCs engrafted in immunodeficient mice at clinically relevant frequencies. These studies provide the foundation for a permanent curative therapy in XHIM.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota is essential for the normal function of the gut immune system, and microbiota alterations are associated with autoimmune disorders. However, how the gut microbiota prevents autoimmunity in distant organs remains poorly defined. Here we reveal that gut microbiota conditioned innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) induce the expression of mouse β-defensin 14 (mBD14) by pancreatic endocrine cells, preventing autoimmune diabetes in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. MBD14 stimulates, via Toll-like receptor 2, interleukin-4 (IL-4)-secreting B cells that induce regulatory macrophages, which in turn induce protective regulatory T cells. The gut microbiota-derived molecules, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands and butyrate, promote IL-22 secretion by pancreatic ILCs, which induce expression of mBD14 by endocrine cells. Dysbiotic microbiota and low-affinity AHR allele explain the defective pancreatic expression of mBD14 observed in NOD mice. Our study reveals a yet unidentified crosstalk between ILCs and endocrine cells in the pancreas that is essential for the prevention of autoimmune diabetes development.

Abstract: Summary
Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a medically important respiratory plus-strand RNA virus of children that has been linked to acute flaccid myelitis. We have determined that EV-D68 induces autophagic signaling and membrane formation. Autophagy, a homeostatic degradative process that breaks down protein aggregates and damaged organelles, promotes replication of multiple plus-strand viruses. Induction of autophagic signals promotes EV-D68 replication, but the virus inhibits the downstream degradative steps of autophagy in multiple ways. EV-D68 proteases cleave a major autophagic cargo adaptor and the autophagic SNARE SNAP29, which reportedly regulates fusion between autophagosome to amphisome/autolysosome. Although the virus inhibits autophagic degradation, SNAP29 promotes virus replication early in infection. An orphan SNARE, SNAP47, is shown to have a previously unknown role in autophagy, and SNAP47 promotes the replication of EV-D68. Our study illuminates a mechanism for subversion of autophagic flux and redirection of the autophagic membranes to benefit EV-D68 replication.

Abstract: Summary
We have developed a cancer model of gliomas in human cerebral organoids that allows direct observation of tumor initiation as well as continuous microscopic observations. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to target an HRasG12V-IRES-tdTomato construct by homologous recombination into the TP53 locus. Results show that transformed cells rapidly become invasive and destroy surrounding organoid structures, overwhelming the entire organoid. Tumor cells in the organoids can be orthotopically xenografted into immunodeficient NOD/SCID IL2RG−/− animals, exhibiting an invasive phenotype. Organoid-generated putative tumor cells show gene expression profiles consistent with mesenchymal subtype human glioblastoma. We further demonstrate that human-organoid-derived tumor cell lines or primary human-patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines can be transplanted into human cerebral organoids to establish invasive tumor-like structures. Our results show potential for the use of organoids as a platform to test human cancer phenotypes that recapitulate key aspects of malignancy.

Abstract: Summary
Post-transcriptional RNA processing is a core mechanism of gene expression control in cell stress response. The poly(A) tail influences mRNA translation and stability, but it is unclear whether there are global roles of poly(A)-tail lengths in cell stress. To address this, we developed tail-end displacement sequencing (TED-seq) for an efficient transcriptome-wide profiling of poly(A) lengths and applied it to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human cells. ER stress induced increases in the poly(A) lengths of certain mRNAs, including known ER stress regulators, XBP1, DDIT3, and HSPA5. Importantly, the mRNAs with increased poly(A) lengths are both translationally de-repressed and stabilized. Furthermore, mRNAs in stress-induced RNA granules have shorter poly(A) tails than in the cytoplasm, supporting the view that RNA processing is compartmentalized. In conclusion, TED-seq reveals that poly(A) length is dynamically regulated upon ER stress, with potential consequences for both translation and mRNA turnover.
