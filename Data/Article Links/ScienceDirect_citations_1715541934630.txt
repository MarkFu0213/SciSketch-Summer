Abstract: Cutaneous wound healing is a dynamic, complex, and well-organized process that requires the orchestration of many different cell types and cellular processes. Transforming growth factor β1 is an important factor that plays a key role during wound healing. Amphibian skin has been proven to possess excellent wound healing ability, whilst no bioactive substrate related to it has ever been identified. Here, a potential wound healing-promoting peptide (AH90, ATAWDFGPHGLLPIRPIRIRPLCG) was identified from the frog skin of Odorrana grahami. It showed potential wound healing-promoting activity in a murine model with full thickness dermal wound. AH90 promoted release of transforming growth factor β1 through activation of nuclear factor-κB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathways, while inhibitors of nuclear factor-κB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase inhibited the process. In addition, the effects of AH90 on Smads family proteins, key regulators in transforming growth factor β1 signaling pathways, could also be inhibited by transforming growth factor β1 antibody. Altogether, this indicated that AH90 promoted wound healing by inducing the release of transforming growth factor β1. This current study may facilitate the understanding of effective factors involved in the wound repair of amphibians and the underlying mechanisms as well. Considering its favorable traits as a small peptide that greatly promoting generation of endogenous wound healing agents (transforming growth factor β1) without mitogenic effects, AH90 might be an excellent template for the future development of novel wound-healing agents.

Abstract: The operating cell temperature of a HCPV module or system is a key factor, because it directly affects efficiency and reliability. Hence, the accurate estimation of cell temperature in a HCPV module is crucial. Under real operating conditions, HCPV modules work at the maximum power point, because they are connected to an inverter. At the maximum power point, the cell temperature is lower than the cell temperature of open circuit, because solar cells are generating power which is not transformed into heat. At present, none of the existing methods are valid to estimate the operating cell temperature of a HCPV module connected to an inverter. In this paper, a procedure for estimating this temperature is introduced. The results show that the proposed method performs effectively in the estimation of the cell temperature in a HCPV module connected to an inverter. In addition, an analysis of the difference between the cell temperature of open circuit and the cell temperature at the maximum power point in a HCPV is conducted and a difference of up to 21°C has been found.

Abstract: This study was designed to investigate the effects of physical conditioning on the expression of the insulin sensitive glucose transporter-4 protein (GLUT4) on mononuclear cells and HOMA-IR levels in dogs and compared to results reported in human skeletal muscle and the skeletal muscle of rodent models. Blood was sampled from conditioned dogs (n=8) and sedentary dogs (n=8). The conditioned dogs were exercised four months prior the experiment and were following a uniform training protocol, whereas the sedentary dogs were not. GLUT4 expression in mononuclear cells and plasma insulin levels were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood glucose levels were determined using blood plasma. HOMA-IR was calculated using plasma insulin and blood glucose levels using the linear approximation formula. Our results indicate that the state of conditioning had a significant effect on the GLUT4 expression at the surface of mononuclear cells. HOMA-IR was also affected by conditioning in dogs. GLUT4 levels in mononuclear cells of sled dogs were inversely correlated with the homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity. This study demonstrates that conditioning increases GLUT4 levels in mononuclear cells of sled dogs as it has been previously reported in skeletal muscle. Our results support the potential of white blood cells as a proxy tissue for studying insulin signaling and may lead to development of a minimally invasive and direct marker of insulin resistance. This may be the first report of GLUT4 in mononuclear cells in response to exercise and measured with ELISA.

Abstract: In this paper, we present laminated concept for indium tin oxide (ITO)-free organic solar cells (OSC). This concept omits the need of electrode deposition on top of organic layers and thus gives freedom of choice for the electrodes and the corresponding deposition techniques to achieve the best ratio between material consumption and electrical/optical properties. Various lamination processes have already been conducted on organic solar cells, mainly hot press lamination in which the lamination is done under high pressure in preheated conditions for several minutes. Here a new concept is presented where the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible foils with organic layers are laminated without the use of high pressure and/or temperature and are just passed through simple lamination rolls. This use of simple lamination rolls and elimination of high pressure and temperature during lamination makes this concept a significant step closer to roll to roll (R2R) compatible. Furthermore the transparent contact was formed by a silver (Ag) grid and highly conductive Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) to replace ITO. To our best knowledge, this is the first ITO-free laminated concept on flexible foils which additionally eliminates the use of high pressure lamination. For a laminated organic solar cell with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): (6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as photoactive layer, experimental results have shown a device efficiency of 2.5% on an active area of 1.1cm2 which is more than 80% of the reference device efficiency with similar device architecture on a single substrate.

Abstract: A uniform ultrathin (<30nm) CdS buffer layer was deposited by CBD by utilizing an alternative bath based on N-methylthiourea and was compared with the standard sulfur source. The CdS deposited by this new bath formulation was deposited separately on soda lime glass (SLG), sputtered molybdenum/glass and co-evaporated copper indium gallium di-selenide (CIGS)/Mo/glass substrates. The CdS film properties were investigated by scanning electric microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS), UV–vis spectroscopy, and quantum efficiency (QE). The films deposited with N-methylthiourea were found to have a similar granular structure, deposit in the same stoichiometry, and have similar device performance as the standard when deposited in the 60–80nm film thickness range. When the CdS layer was deposited ultrathin in the 20–30nm range, it was found to have good surface coverage with no evidence pinholes or device shunting. QE data indicated 40nm thick CdS samples deposited using Thiourea as a sulfur source demonstrated better overall results however depositing a 20nm thick CdS demonstrated N-methylthiourea as a sulfur source could deposit with good quantum efficiency and more consistently. Devices fabricated with ultrathin CdS using N-metyhlthiourea showed better device performance compared with devices fabricated using the standard CdS chemistry.

Abstract: A complete understanding of the reliability for ZnO-based transparent conducting oxides is essential for actual applications in photovoltaic devices or displays requiring long-term stability. The stability and degradation mechanisms under a controlled damp-heat environment (humid and hot atmosphere) for sputter-deposited aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) thin films were quantitatively studied. The continuous degradations of carrier concentration and mobility with the Fermi-level shift were observed, and this behavior was resolved by separating the changes in the carrier-transport characteristics of the intragrain and grain boundary. By correlating the temperature dependence of electrical characteristics with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the degradation is well explained by the increase of chemisorbed OH− in the grain boundaries.

Abstract: This work reports on the stability of encapsulated ITO-free bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSC) under UV radiation in ambient air with the layer sequence Cr/Al/Cr/photoactive layer (PAL)/poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/metal-grid. The PAL consisted of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C60 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor. BHJ-OSC with this setup showed remarkable stability under continuous illumination (1000W/m2) with a low UV content. In contrast, the devices degraded significantly under UV radiation which was characterized by a reduction in fill factor and short-circuit current density. Additional experiments revealed an increase of the sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSS layer which was interestingly much more pronounced in pure PEDOT:PSS samples as compared to samples where a PAL was deposited underneath. In addition, current extraction by linear increasing voltage (CELIV) measurements indicated a decrease of the effective charge carrier mobility of the PAL. Numerical simulations based on the experimentally determined parameters showed good agreement of the solar cell performance as a function of UV exposure duration. This suggests that the increase of the sheet resistance of the polymeric hole contact and to a lesser extent the change of the effective mobility of the PAL are the main factors governing the deterioration of the photovoltaic performance upon UV exposure. A comparison to devices with a setup ITO/ZnO/PAL/PEDOT:PSS and a full metallization showed clearly improved UV stability, although the absorption of UV in the PAL is very similar. This further supports our interpretation that the degradation of the PAL plays a very minor role. The issue with the degradation of the PEDOT:PSS can easily be solved by incorporating an UV-filter into the device or preferably the use of UV-stabilized PEDOT:PSS formulations.

Abstract: This paper reports a novel zinc diffusion method for forming emitters in GaSb thermophotovoltaic cells. A closed quartz-tube diffusion system using Zn–Ga alloys as the diffusion source was designed to realize p-type doping in N-GaSb wafers. The surface diffusion region showing a high concentration of zinc was suppressed by this diffusion method, and the GaSb cells fabricated using this method showed good quantum efficiency in the near-infrared bands. Compared to that of the conventional pseudo-closed-box diffusion method, the controllability of the etch-back process after front-side metallization is significantly improved, and the cost of the cell fabrication is reduced because no protective gas is required during the diffusion process.

Abstract: The solution-based synthesis of quaternary Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanocrystals and further processing into a homogeneous photovoltaic absorber film prove challenging due to the stability of binary and ternary chalcogenide compounds comprised of Cu, Zn, and Sn cations. In this contribution, CZTS nanocrystals are synthesized according to a previously reported synthesis recipe yielding devices with reported efficiencies as high as 7.2%. The particles are separated by size into two populations exhibiting size-correlated composition variations. This observation highlights the challenges in synthesizing quaternary CZTS nanoparticles with interparticle composition uniformity. Films of particles from each population are sintered in a selenium atmosphere and found to exhibit a notable degree of phase segregation in the final film, while a mixture of particles from both populations converts into a relatively homogeneous film upon selenization. Devices fabricated from the two particle populations separately as well as the mixture of particles exhibit varying degrees of performance, with the mixed particle cells achieving total area efficiencies as high as 7.9%. A modified synthesis recipe producing CZTS particles with narrower composition variations is shown to produce devices with improved efficiencies up to 8.4%. Preliminary conclusions regarding the effect of nanocrystal heterogeneity on film sintering and device performance are presented.

Abstract: Nickel oxide materials are suitable for counter electrodes in complementary electrochromic devices. The state-of-the-art nickel oxide counter electrode materials are typically prepared with multiple additives to enhance peformance. Herein, nanocomposite nickel oxide counter electrodes were fabricated via RF magnetron co-sputtering from Ni–Zr alloy and Li2O ceramic targets. The as-deposited nanocomposite counter electrodes were characterized with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). It was found that the stoichiometry, crystal structure and electronic structure of the nickel oxide-based materials could be readily tuned by varying the Li2O sputter deposition power level. Comprehensive electrochromic evaluation demonstrated that the performance of the nickel oxide-based materials was dependent on the overall Li stoichiometry. Overall, the nanocomposite nickel oxide counter electrode containing lithium and zirconium synthesized with a Li2O deposition power of 45W exhibited the optimal performance with an optical modulation of 71% and coloration efficiency of 30cm2/C at 670nm in Li-ion electrolyte.

Abstract: Reprogramming is a new wave in cellular therapies to achieve the vital goals of regenerative medicine. Transdifferentiation, whereas the differentiated state of cells could be reprogrammed into other cell types, meaning cells are no more locked in their differentiated circle. Hence, cells of choice from abundant and easily available sources such as fibroblast and adipose tissue could be converted into cells of demand, to restore the diseased tissues. Before diverting this new approach into effective clinical use, transdifferentiation could not be simply overlooked, as it challenges the normal paradigms of biological laws, where mature cells transdifferentiate not only within same germ layers, but even across the lineage boundaries. How unipotent differentiated cells reprogram into another, and whether transdifferentiation proceeds via a direct cell-to-cell conversion or needs dedifferentiation. To address such questions, MSC were adipogenically differentiated followed by direct transdifferentiation, and subsequently examined by histology, immunohistochemistry, qPCR and single cell analysis. Direct cellular conversion of adipogenic lineage cells into osteogenic or chondrogenic resulted in mixed culture of both lineage cells (adipogenic and new acquiring osteogenic/chondrogenic phenotypes). On molecular level, such conversion was confirmed by significantly upregulated expression of PPARG, FABP4, SPP1 and RUNX2. Chondrogenic transdifferentiation was verified by significantly upregulated expression of PPARG, FABP4, SOX9 and COL2A1. Single cell analysis did not support the direct cell-to-cell conversion, rather described the involvement of dedifferentiation. Moreover, some differentiated single cells did not change their phenotype and were resistant to transdifferentiation, suggesting that differentiated cells behave differently during cellular conversion. An obvious characterization of differentiated cells could be helpful to understand the process of transdifferentiation.

Results showed that the greater intensities of π–π* transitions from the electron-rich Th-DTSi-[HxTh]2 bridge to [HxTh]2-MMN (or [HxTh]2-HCA) acceptors provide superior photocurrent efficiencies from absorbed photons compared to those via ICT transition in SMOSCs fabricated with these new materials coupled with PC71BM BHJ films.

Abstract: Procollagen C-proteinase enhancer 1 (PCPE-1) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that can stimulate procollagen processing by procollagen C-proteinases (PCPs) such as bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1). PCPE-1 consists of two CUB domains that bind to the procollagen C-propeptide and are responsible for enhancing activity and a netrin-like (NTR) domain that binds to BMP-1 as well as heparin and heparan sulfate. The NTR domain also mediates binding of PCPE-1 to cells, an interaction inhibited by heparin, thus suggesting involvement of cell membrane heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Using pull-down experiments and an ELISA type binding assay we show here that PCPE-1 binds to three cell membrane HSPGs, syndecans-1, -2 and -4. We also demonstrate that this binding is mediated by the NTR domain and depends on the glycosaminoglycan chains of the syndecans. Using co-immunoprecipitation and an ELISA type binding assay we show that PCPE-1 can also bind fibronectin (an established binding partner of BMP-1), another interaction involving the NTR domain. Consistently, fibronectin inhibits cell attachment to PCPE-1 although it does not affect PCPE-1 enhancing activity. PCPE-1 is not an adhesive protein since cell attachment to PCPE-1 is not associated with cell spreading and/or actin filaments formation. The results suggest that PCPE-1 binding to syndecans and/or fibronectin may control collagen fibril assembly on the cell surface. Further characterization of these interactions may pave the way for future design of new means to modulate collagen deposition in pathological conditions such as fibrosis.

Abstract: Analyses of current–voltage characteristics of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4-based solar cells reveal a non-superposition between dark and illuminated curves. Numerical simulations have been carried out to model the behavior of the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4/CdS heterojunction, and to extract from experimental data the minority carrier diffusion length in the absorber. A small value of 200nm has been found, which induces collection losses in the absorber and is therefore a limiting factor to achieve high power conversion efficiencies. Additional experimental results, such as irradiance dependent photovoltaic properties and voltage dependent external quantum efficiency, are also presented and simulated with the same model. This confirms the validity of our approach and reveals interesting effects in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4-based solar cells.

Abstract: High germanium (Ge) content hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon–germanium alloy (μc-Si1−xGex:H) has been prepared by conventional plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The influence of the bombardment of energetic ions on the structural and electrical properties of high Ge content μc-Si1−xGex:H films was studied by Raman, transmission electron microscopy and conductivity measurements. Under low pressure and high levels of ion bombardment conditions, a mitigation of the rapid increase of Ge incorporation and a significant improvement of the homogeneous distribution of the crystal grains for high Ge content μc-Si1−xGex:H films were achieved. Consequently, an enhancement in the quantum efficiencies over 800nm wavelengths and a spectral response extending to 1300nm for μc-Si1−xGex:H solar cells were achieved by using an intrinsic layer with x=0.77.

Abstract: Tungsten (VI) oxide−WO3 is a widely studied functional inorganic semiconductor material with exceptional chromogenic properties. It is used in energy efficient systems such as smart windows, sensors, displays, storage units, photocatalysts and solar cells. Layers of WO3 are generally produced using expensive vacuum deposition techniques. In this paper, the inkjet printing of sol–gel derived tungsten inks on glass and transparent conductive oxide is reported. Peroxo sol–gel synthesis was used to prepare peroxopolytungstic acid sols which were then modified using different solvents to obtain a suitable jetting ink. Described are the rheological and structural properties of WO3 inks, the dynamics of WO3 droplets and the morphology and quality of WO3 printouts. The functionality of these transparent WO3 layers is successfully demonstrated in an electrochromic device.

Abstract: Electrochromic nickel oxide (Ni1−xO) pigment powder which was made from nickel acetate reacting with H2O2/urea solution followed by heat treatment of xerogels at 400°C (24h) was milled with zirconia beads in pure water or water with added nickel oxyhydroxy precipitate acting simultaneously as the dispersant and the coating binder. The corresponding pigment particle suspensions were spin coated on FTO glass and flexible ITO-PET foils, respectively, and cured at 150°C. The optical properties of the deposited pigment coatings on FTO glass substrates were determined with an UV VIS spectrometer, providing total direct transmittance (TT), total diffuse transmittance (DT) and haze (in %). Haze increased with the coating thickness but did not exceed 4%. SEM micrographs of the deposited pigment coatings revealed that they consisted of agglomerated Ni1−xO pigment with voids. Potential cycling of Ni1−xO pigment coatings and Ni1−xO thin films was performed in 1M LiClO4/PC and 0.1M TBA+ triflate/PC electrolytes, revealing that the pigment coatings exhibited electrochemical and electrochromic activity also in lithium free (aprotic) electrolyte, while variations of the oxidation and reduction reaction peaks at various scan rates confirmed the presence of surface electrochemical reactions. The near-grazing incidence angle reflection–absorption spectroscopic technique (IR RA) was employed for identifying surface and inner-grain Ni–O stretching modes, the former being responsible for observed electrochemical properties, which was also demonstrated from the ex situ IR RA measurements performed for coatings charged/discharged in 1M LiClO4/PC and 0.1M TBA+ triflate/PC electrolytes. The results disclosed in this study suggest that the electrochromic effect was not in direct correlation with the de-insertion/insertion of small ions into the NiO (bunsenite) grains but rather the pigment coatings behave similarly to nickel oxide electrochemical capacitors. The electrochromic response of a flexible EC devices made either of PEDOT (self-standing foil) or WO3 and Ni1−xO pigment coatings glued with PMMA based electrolytes without and with lithium salt were recorded for the demonstration of the possible practical application of wet deposited Ni1−xO pigment coatings made as “electrochromic” paints.

Abstract: The effects of sol–gel textured Al-doped ZnO (AZO) cathode buffer layer on the performance of the inverted polymer solar cells have been investigated in this work. Textured AZO, together with a reflective back electrode provides efficient light-trapping, inducing further light absorption in the active layer. The AZO films were characterized with respect to their morphology, optical and electrical properties. Due to the enhanced absorption at near-UV/blue light region (300–500nm), the short current density of the textured-AZO device is increased from 9.52 to 11.30mA/cm2 compared with the reference cell based on the flat-AZO. Power conversion efficiency is increased substantially from 2.44% to 2.87% since without loss in the fill factor and open circuit voltage.

Abstract: Gastric cancer is one of the most prevailing cancers with high morbidity and mortality. Limitations in the current diagnosis and therapy, specially lacking of specific molecular therapeutic targets, ask for the development of new strategies. Aptamer, a newly developed adaptive molecule, could be used in clinical detection and therapy because of its high affinity and specificity. As no aptamer has ever been developed in preventing gastric cancer so far, we were the first who cloned such an aptamer specifically targeting gastric cancer. The aptamer was selected by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment with gastric cancer cell-line HGC-27 as target cell line and immortalized gastric epithelial cell-line GES-1 as control cell line. The affinity and specificity of candidate aptamers were examined by flow cytometry, confocal imagining and aptamer-based histochemistry staining. After 19 cycles of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment and subsequent cloning and sequencing, an aptamer with the highest affinity and specificity (nominated as AGC03) among candidates was screened out from a random single-stranded DNA pool. Moreover, AGC03 could not only specifically bind to gastric cancer cells (the equilibrium dissociation constant value was 16.49±0.40nM) in vitro, but also recognize cancer cells in human cancer tissue. Our most important finding is that AGC03 could even be internalized into cells automatically. In conclusion, we obtained a novel aptamer specifically targeting gastric cancer, which is an effective tool for both gastric cancer diagnosis and drug delivery.

Abstract: We report all-polymer solar cells with new electron-accepting (n-type) polymer nanoparticles, poly(2,7-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-9H-fluoren-9-one-co-benzothiadiazole) (BHTF-co-BT), which were in-situ generated during polymerization reaction. The size of the BHTF-co-BT nanoparticles was ca. 5–15nm with a particular single X-ray diffraction peak (d-spacing=1.3nm), indicative of a highly ordered crystalline state, while their glass transition temperature was ~140°C. Their band gap energy and ionization potential were 1.8eV and 5.7eV, respectively. The possibility of the BHTF-co-BT nanoparticles as an electron acceptor for both normal-type and inverted-type all-polymer (polymer:polymer) solar cells was examined by employing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron donor. The normal-type P3HT:BHTF-co-BT solar cells exhibited promising open circuit voltage (Voc=0.67–0.73V) and fill factor (FF=51.3%), while a three-fold improved short circuit current density and higher Voc (0.77V) were achieved for their inverted-type solar cells.

Abstract: In recent years, alternatives to PEDOT:PSS, which is used in organic light-emitting diodes and polymer solar cells (PSCs), have been actively researched due to its disadvantages in terms of device stability. Nevertheless, PEDOT:PSS is still one of most powerful materials due to its good conductivity, low-temperature processability, and suitable work function that is well-matched with the HOMO energy levels of most donor polymers. In this study, an ultra-thin tungsten oxide/PEDOT:PSS hybrid hole extraction layer (H-HEL) is designed to take advantage of the benefits of PEDOT:PSS and address the device stability problems of PEDOT:PSS. Device stability is dramatically improved and power conversion efficiency is slightly improved in P3HT:PC60BM model system according to the ISOS-D-1 protocol. In order to understand this phenomenon, time-dependent photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurements are conducted for device stability combined with atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies.

Abstract: Luminescent down-shifting (LDS) is an elegant, purely optical method to improve the short-wavelength response of photovoltaic (PV) modules by red-shifting the incident solar spectrum. This paper in a first step develops a simple optical model to investigate the effect of LDS layers on top of PV modules on their external quantum efficiency. A meaningful figure of merit is the LDS efficiency ηLDS which quantifies the efficiency of the LDS layer to down-shift absorbed photons and send them towards the underlying solar cell. The simplified optical model developed here, extracts LDS efficiencies from experimental quantum efficiency spectra, and thereby enables assessing the current status and future potential of LDS for various solar cell technologies. Our simplified LDS model is fast, easy-to-use and universally applicable to analyze experimental LDS results. Moreover, it is especially useful for screening candidate LDS materials.

Abstract: The impact of post-treatments such as annealing, light-soaking and heat-light soaking on film properties and cell performance of ZnS(O,OH)/Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells were investigated, when ZnS(O,OH) buffer layer was deposited using a thioacetamide (TAA)-ammonia based chemical solution. Chemical bath deposition (CBD) time was shortened to one seventh by combination of a thinner buffer layer and TAA-ammonia based high-rate CBD, as compared to conventional thiourea (TU)-ammonia based CBD process. The ZnO:B window layer was deposited by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) in order to avoid plasma-damage during subsequent sputtering process. An optimum CIGS solar cell fabricated using 50nm-thick ZnS(O,OH) buffer layer yielded a total area efficiency of 18.8% after heat-light soaking treatment for 80min at 130°C under AM1.5, 100mW/cm2 illumination. The influence of post-treatments on the compositional changes of the ZnS(O,OH) buffer layer, which affect the conduction band offset(CBO) at the CIGS/ZnS(O,OH) interface, are also discussed on the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) analysis.

Abstract: Mixed phase, hydrogenated amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon thin films grown by co-deposition (nanocrystals and amorphous material deposited sequentially in the same vacuum system) demonstrate pronounced quantum confinement effects. Based on photoluminescence measurements of co-deposited samples, we find evidence that the optical gap of nanocrystals embedded in hydrogenated amorphous silicon is increased to energies exceeding bulk crystalline silicon values – at least as high as 1.35eV. The broad spectrum of emission of the nanocrystals is attributed to the size distribution and local fluctuations in matrix hydrogenation. The temperature dependence of this PL suggests that these nanocrystals possess fewer defects than those grown by conventional plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition methods. Interactions between electronic states in nanocrystals and localized states in amorphous silicon matrix tissues are discussed in terms of their role in determining the strength of the quantum confinement potential.

Abstract: Albuminuria is not only an important marker of chronic kidney disease but also a crucial contributor to tubulointerstitial inflammation (TIF). In this study, we determined whether activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome is involved in albuminuria induced-TIF and the underlying mechanisms of inflammasome activation by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS). We established an albumin-overload induced rat nephropathy model characterised by albuminuria, renal infiltration of inflammatory cells, tubular dilation and atrophy. The renal expression levels of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, IL-1β and IL-18 were significantly increased in this animal model. In vitro, albumin time- and dose-dependently increased the expression levels of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, IL-1β and IL18. Moreover, the silencing of the Nlrp3 gene or the use of the caspase-1 inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk significantly attenuated the albumin-induced increase in IL-1β and IL-18 expression in HK2 cells. In addition, mROS generation was elevated by albumin stimulation, whereas the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) inhibited Nlrp3 expression and the release of IL-1β and IL-18. In kidney biopsy specimens obtained from patients with IgA nephropathy, Nlrp3 expression was localised to the proximal tubular epithelial cells, and this result is closely correlated with the extent of proteinuria and TIF. In summary, this study demonstrates that albuminuria may serve as an endogenous danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that stimulates TIF via the mROS-mediated activation of the cytoplasmic Nlrp3 inflammasome.

Abstract: After some months of operation, a number of PV modules develop a discolouration defect called “snail trails”, or “snail traces”, which appear as irregular dark stripes across the cells. Whereas these traces were soon identified as discoloured silver contacts along the cell edges or at micro cracks, the chemical and mechanistic reasons for this phenomenon have not yet been resolved in detail. In this work we show that silver nanoparticles accumulating within the encapsulation foil cause the brownish discolouration, and that certain additives of encapsulation and back sheet foils trigger the formation of these nanoparticles.

Abstract: Bi2Te3 thin films were fabricated by vacuum co-evaporation and the properties of the films were investigated using X-ray diffraction, Hall measurements, and synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy. The results indicate that p-type Bi2Te3 films, which have a work function of about 5.4eV and carrier concentration of the order of 1021cm−3, are a rhombohedral phase with a strong (105) preferred orientation. A co-evaporated Bi2Te3 buffer layer was used for a back contact to CdTe thin film solar cells. C–V measurements, light and dark J–V measurements, and spectral response analysis also show that the p back contact has greatly enhanced cell performance.

Abstract: Graphene oxide (GO) sheets are introduced to stabilize the shape of the most widely studied phase change material for thermal storage, polyethylene glycol (PEG) during the solid–liquid phase change process. In this composite, a maximum weight percentage of PEG as high as 96% without any leakage up to a temperature as high as 150°C, far above the melting temperature of PEG, has been achieved. Such a weight percentage of PEG is the highest value among PEG based shape-stabilized PCMs to the best of author׳s knowledge. The shape-stable PCM presents a high heat storage capacity of 142.8Jg−1 and excellent thermal reliability within at least 200 melting/freezing cycles. The thermal properties of the PEG/GO composite PCMs with various GO contents are also investigated. The present study provides a highly potential shape-stabilized composite PCM with a high content of PEG for thermal energy storage as well as a way to enhance the heat storage density of PEG based shape-stabilized PCM.

Abstract: Salvianolic acid B, a major bioactive component of Chinese medicine herb, Salvia miltiorrhiza, is widely used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Our recent studies have shown that Salvianolic acid B can prevent development of osteoporosis. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not clarified clearly. In the present study, we aim to investigate the effects of Salvianolic acid B on viability and osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The results showed Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) had no obvious toxic effects on hMSCs, whereas Sal B supplementation (5μM) increased the alkaline phosphatase activity, osteopontin, Runx2 and osterix expression in hMSCs. Under osteogenic induction condition, Sal B (5μM) significantly promoted mineralization; and when the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases signaling (ERK) pathway was blocked, the anabolic effects of Sal B were diminished, indicating that Sal B promoted osteogenesis of hMSCs through activating ERK signaling pathway. The current study confirms that Sal B promotes osteogenesis of hMSCs with no cytotoxicity, and it may be used as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of osteoporosis.

Abstract: The hydrogen plasma passivation of thin film polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) was investigated in conjunction with plasma texturing process to make efficient heterojunction solar cells. The pc-Si layers were first treated using direct and remote hydrogen plasma technologies. The heterojunction solar cells were then fabricated by subsequent deposition of i/n+ a-Si:H. Hydrogenation at high temperature (610°C) results in enhanced dissolution and diffusion of hydrogen in pc-Si by a factor of about 3 and 4, respectively, in comparison with those at low temperature (420°C). The hydrogen atoms in the pc-Si layer mainly bond to the silicon dangling bonds and form complexes with dopant atoms. In addition, platelets defects are generated by the hydrogen plasma in the sub-surface region of pc-Si hydrogenated at 420°C and cause higher saturation current in the space charge region whilst they form in the region deeper than 1μm at 610°C. Removal of the platelets using SF6/N2O plasma post-texturing after low-temperature hydrogenation not only enhances the short circuit current but also improves the open circuit voltage and the fill factor simultaneously. Combining plasma pre-texturing with high-temperature hydrogenation, the best 2µm-thick pc-Si heterojunction solar cell reaches an efficiency of 8.54%.

Abstract: High performance mesoporous tungsten oxide films were deposited by ultrasonic spray deposition using templated sol–gel chemistry. The dynamics of both sol preparation and hydrolysis were investigated by UV–vis spectroscopy. A stable sol was formed after 12h, while optimum electrochromic performance was obtained for 12h of hydrolysis. Electrochromic performance is strongly correlated to the annealing conditions, with optimized films displaying coloration efficiency >50cm2/C and switching times <10s. FTIR spectroscopy revealed that WO3 produced under optimized conditions were free of hydroxyl and carbonate impurities. Performance scaled with the specific surface area and nanoscale morphology. The WO3 films display good long term cycling durability up to 2500 cycles, which was attributed to the high degree of film crystallinity.

Abstract: In this work, we have demonstrated that simple brush-painted Ti-doped In2O3(TIO) films can be used as a cost effective transparent anodes for organic solar cells (OSCs). By the direct brushing of TIO nanoparticles ink and rapid thermal annealing (RTA), we can simply obtain TIO electrodes with a low sheet resistance of 28.25Ω/□ and a high optical transmittance of 85.48% under atmospheric ambient conditions. In particular, the brush painted TIO films showed a much higher mobility (33.4cm2/Vs) than that of previously reported solution-process transparent oxide films (1–5cm2/Vs) due to the effects of the Ti dopant with higher Lewis acid strength (3.06) and the reduced contact resistance of TIO nanoparticles. The OSCs fabricated on the brush-painted TIO films exhibited cell-performance with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.61V, shot circuit current (Jsc) of 7.90mA/cm2, fill factor (FF) of 61%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.94%. This indicates that brush-painted TIO film is a promising cost-effective transparent electrode for printing-based OSCs with its simple process and high performance.

Abstract: Two types of semiconducting nanoparticulate suspensions of 1:1 poly-3-hexylthiophene: 1-(methoxycarbonylpropyl)-1-phenyl-[6,6]C61 have been prepared using (i) a surfactant-containing mini-emulsion process with sodium dodecyl sulphate as the surfactant, and (ii) a surfactant-free precipitation method respectively. The nanoparticle dispersions, nanoparticle thin films and nanoparticulate organic photovoltaic (NP-OPV) devices have been characterised using a combination of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The miniemulsion process produces nanoparticles with a core–shell morphology consisting of a P3HT-rich shell and PCBM-rich core. Upon annealing gross phase segregation of nanoparticulate thin films occurs and NP-OPV device performance falls accordingly as charge separation in the device is inhibited. By contrast the precipitation method produces fully blended nanoparticles with the device parameters for unannealed NP-OPV devices of both materials appearing very similar. Annealing of the nanoparticulate thin films prepared by the precipitation method does not lead to gross phase segregation serving rather to join the nanoparticles together. Instead a blended composition and morphology is observed and the corresponding NP-OPV devices improve dramatically upon thermal treatment.

Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes an epithelial anion channel. Since the identification of the disease in 1938 and up until 2012, CF patients have been treated exclusively with medications aimed at bettering their respiratory, digestive, inflammatory and infectious symptoms. The identification of the CFTR gene in 1989 gave hopes of rapidly finding a cure for the disease, for which over 1950 mutations have been identified. Since 2012, recent approaches have enabled the identification of small molecules targeting either the CFTR protein directly or its key processing steps, giving rise to novel promising therapeutic tools. This review presents the current CFTR mutation classifications according to their clinical consequences and to their effect on the structure and function of the CFTR channel. How these classifications are essential in the establishment of mutation-targeted therapeutic strategies is then discussed.

Abstract: In this paper we address the fundamental challenge of balancing the trade-off between the optical and electrical properties of the front side transparent conductive oxide (TCO) in silicon heterojunction solar cells. We present two-dimensional numerical device simulations as well as experimental investigations concerning n-type silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells featuring either a front emitter or rear emitter. By varying both, the pitch of the front side metal grid electrode and the sheet resistance of the front side TCO, the fill factor losses associated with the two-dimensional carrier transport are investigated. We prove experimentally that in the case of the rear emitter design a substantial part of the lateral carrier transport is shifted from the front side TCO into the absorber, thus, lowering the effective sheet resistance of the front side. Owing to this additional lateral current path the trade-off between the optical and electrical properties of the front side TCO are less pronounced for a rear emitter cell design compared to the traditional front emitter cell design. This leads to fewer restrictions for the choice of front side TCOs and the design of the front side metal grid electrode. Depending on the optimization route, this should allow for higher solar cell efficiencies or the application of more economic TCOs.

Abstract: Proteins of the 14-3-3 family are universal participate in multiple cellular processes. However, their exact role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases remains unclear. In this study, we proposed that human PrP was able to form molecular complex with 14-3-3β. The domains responsible for the interactions between PrP and 14-3-3β were mapped at the segments of amino acid (aa) residues 106–126 within PrP and aa 1–38 within 14-3-3β. Homology modeling revealed that the key aa residues for molecular interaction were D22 and D23 in 14-3-3β as well as K110 in PrP. Mutations in these aa residues inhibited the interaction between the two proteins in vitro. Our results also showed that recombinant PrP encouraged 14-3-3β dimer formation, whereas PrP106–126 peptide inhibited it. Recombinant 14-3-3β disaggregated the mature PrP106–126 fibrils in vitro. Moreover, the PrP–14-3-3 protein complexes were observed in the brain tissues of normal and scrapie agent 263K infected hamsters. Colocalization of PrP and 14-3-3 was seen in the cytoplasm of human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, as well as human cervical cancer cell line HeLa transiently expressing full-length human PrP. Our current data suggest the neuroprotection of PrPC and neuron damage caused by PrPSc may be associated with their functions of 14-3-3 dimerization regulation.

Abstract: We demonstrate cost-effective, indium tin oxide (ITO)-free organic solar cells (OSCs) fabricated with a silver nanowire (AgNW)–poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) composite electrode. The composite films were prepared with a one-step spray-coating of a mixture composed of AgNW and a highly conductive, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-treated PEDOT:PSS (hcPEDOT). The film-thickness, optical transmittance, and sheet resistance of AgNW–hcPEDOT hybrid electrodes were easily controlled by varying the spray deposition time. With AgNW–hcPEDOT composite electrodes, the devices exhibited high power conversion efficiencies of up to 2.16% under 100mWcm−2 and AM 1.5G illumination conditions. In addition, the surface of the AgNW–hcPEDOT composite electrodes was further smoothened with an additional spray-coated PEDOT:PSS buffer layer, leading to reduced shorting and improved cell-efficiency. As a result, the best performing devices with a AgNW–hcPEDOT electrode and spray-coated PEDOT buffer exhibited efficiencies of up to 2.65%, which approaches that of conventional ITO-based devices. These results indicate that the one-step spray-coated AgNW–hcPEDOT composite-based film is a viable alternative to the high-cost and vacuum-deposited ITO for mass-production and low-cost roll-to-roll based solar cells.

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) participates in melanoma progression by promoting tumor growth. However, the mechanisms of RAGE activation in melanoma tumors are not clearly understood. To get deeper insights into these mechanisms, we transfected a melanoma cell line, which was established from a human melanoma primary tumor, with RAGE, and studied the effect of RAGE overexpression on cell proliferation and migration in vitro. We observed that overexpression of RAGE in these cells not only resulted in significantly increased migration rates compared to control cells, but also in decreased proliferation rates (Meghnani et al., 2014). In the present study, we compared the growth of xenograft tumors established from RAGE overexpressing WM115 cells, to that of control cells. We observed that when implanted in mice, RAGE overexpressing cells generated tumors faster than control cells. Analysis of protein tumor extracts showed increased levels of the RAGE ligands S100B, S100A2, S100A4, S100A6 and S100A10 in RAGE overexpressing tumors compared to control tumors. We show that the tumor growth was significantly reduced when the mice were treated with anti-RAGE antibodies, suggesting that RAGE, and probably several S100 proteins, were involved in tumor growth. We further demonstrate that the anti-RAGE antibody treatment significantly enhanced the efficacy of the alkylating drug dacarbazine in reducing the growth rate of RAGE overexpressing tumors.

Abstract: Donor–acceptor conjugated polymers, PDTTPDA and PDTTPDT, composed of new acenaphtho[1,2-c]thiophene or thiophene as electron donors and 1,3-dithien-2-yl-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (DTTPD) as the electron acceptor were synthesized by a Stille cross-coupling reaction. These polymers combine interesting properties such as good solubility and excellent thermal stability. The weight-averaged molecular weights (Mw) of PDTTPDA and PDTTPDT were found to be 71,000 and 79,000 with polydispersity indices of 1.65 and 1.66, respectively. Photophysical studies revealed a low bandgap of 1.77eV for PDTTPDA and 1.72eV for PDTTPDT. The present study indicates that the combination of DTTPD and acenaphtho[1,2-c]thiophene building blocks can be a very effective way to lower the HOMO energy level and ultimately to enhance the Voc of polymer solar cells. The Voc reported here (up to 0.94V) is one of the highest observed in polymer:PCBM bulk heterojunction devices, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 3.28% was observed in the PDTTPDA devices.

Abstract: This paper presents a new design of a planar solar concentrator for space applications. The concentrator focuses light onto two spatially separated photovoltaic cells, allowing for independent control of the output power of each cell. Thanks to a blazed diffraction grating superimposed on a Fresnel lens, advantages of both spectral splitting and light focusing can be combined. The theoretical model of the optical design is presented, with the optimization of either element. Moreover, configuration improvement is proposed: a symmetrical configuration composed of two lenses. First numerical results are presented, highlighting the possibility to design a concentrator at about 10×for each cell, with an optical efficiency of about 75% and less than 10% of losses for tracking errors lower than ±0.9°

Abstract: Four fullerene derivatives, benzocyclopentane-C60 mono-adduct (BPCMA) and its bis-adduct (BPCBA), acenaphthene-C60 mono-adduct (ACMA) and its bis-adduct (ACBA), were synthesized by cyclopropanation reaction. Geometrical structures and molecular packing of the mono-adduct compounds (BPCMA and ACMA) were identified by X-ray crystallography. As measured by cyclic voltammetry, LUMO energy levels of BPCBA and ACBA are about 0.08 and 0.09eV higher than their corresponding mono-adducts. Even though the power conversion efficiency remains to be improved, the polymer solar cells (PSCs) incorporating P3HT as donor and BPCBA (or ACBA) as acceptor exhibit open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.67V (or 0.68V), which is about 0.22V (or 0.23V) higher than the PSCs with the mono-adduct BPCMA (or ACMA) as electron acceptor. In addition, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the PSCs involving bis-adducts (BPCBA and ACBA) are obviously higher than those based on BPCMA and ACMA. The photovoltaic difference between mono- and bis-adducts can be rationalized by their different behaviors in LUMO energy and molecular packing.

Abstract: With the final goal of integrating III–V materials on silicon substrates for tandem solar cells, the influence of the metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) environment on the minority carrier properties of silicon wafers has been evaluated. These properties will essentially determine the photovoltaic performance of the bottom cell in a III–V-on-Si tandem solar cell. A comparison of the base minority carrier lifetimes obtained for different thermal processes carried out in a MOVPE reactor on Czochralski silicon wafers has been carried out. An important degradation of minority carrier lifetime during the surface preparation (i.e. H2 anneal) has been observed. Three different mechanisms have been proposed for explaining this behavior: (1) the introduction of extrinsic impurities coming from the reactor; (2) the activation of intrinsic lifetime killing impurities coming from the wafer itself; and finally, (3) the formation of crystal defects, which eventually become recombination centers. The effect of the emitter formation by phosphorus diffusion has also been evaluated. In this sense, it has been reported that lifetime can be recovered during the emitter formation either by the effect of the P on extracting impurities, or by the role of the atomic hydrogen on passivating the defects.

Dual inhibition of Src family kinases and Aurora kinases by SU6656 modulates CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) expression in an ERK-dependent manner,

Abstract: Src kinases are regulators of the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2), which plays a role in fibrotic injuries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential of SU6656, a dual inhibitor of Src family and Aurora kinases, to interfere with the synthesis of this pro-fibrotic factor. SU6656 impaired TGF-β-mediated upregulation of CTGF mRNA and protein in proximal epithelial HKC-8 cells, and also reduced CTGF expression in cells exposed to autocrine growth factors. In association with the inhibition of Src family kinases and diminished focal adhesion kinase activity, adherence of the cells was reduced. Furthermore, SU6656 interfered with Aurora kinase activity resulting in inhibition of cell division and formation multilobular nuclei after 24h. Comparable alterations were observed in primary tubular cells. When cell division was inhibited by SU6656 or ZM447439, a specific inhibitor of Aurora kinases, CTGF levels were back to control or even increased after 48h. The activity of RhoA-Rho kinase and ERK signaling was analyzed to delineate the signaling pathways responsible for the biphasic regulation of CTGF. While Rho kinase was not significantly altered by SU6656, ERK activity was inhibited in the early phase and increased after 24–48h. ERK activity correlated with secreted CTGF. As ZM447439 increased ERK activity only after 48h, cellular reorganization is likely responsible for triggering the ERK-dependent upregulation of CTGF. Taken together, in non-transformed epithelial cells, SU6656 modulates the expression of the pro-fibrotic factor CTGF in a time-dependent manner by inhibition of Src kinases and Aurora kinases.

Abstract: The WO3/PANI core/shell nanowire array is prepared by the combination of solvothermal and electropolymerization methods. The core/shell nanowire array film shows remarkable enhancement of the electrochromic properties. In particular, a significant optical modulation (59% at 700nm), fast switching speed, high coloration efficiency (86.3cm2C−1 at 700nm) and excellent cycling stability are achieved for the core/shell nanowire array film. The improved electrochromic properties are mainly attributed to the formation of the donor–acceptor system, and the porous space among the nanowires, which can make fast ion diffusion and provide larger surface area for charge-transfer reactions. The data indicate great promise for the WO3/PANI core/shell nanowire array as a potential multicolor electrochromic material.

Abstract: Light-selective polymer films based on poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate) (PEVA) are of significant interest in emerging solar materials, including PV encapsulants and greenhouse plastic films. Quantum dots (QDs) have been shown to absorb UV light while transmitting light of higher wavelengths which potentially can be advantageous for enhancing PV efficiencies or in the case of greenhouse films, controlling plant growth. However, a simple procedure for integration of the QD nanocrystals into PEVA films with retention of the light selective properties has been elusive. In this work we report a simple procedure for loading QD nanocrystals into PEVA using a novel silane functionalized QD approach by simple melt-mixing in a twin-screw extruder. Both bare CdS and core–shell CdS–ZnS QDs were synthesized by colloidal chemistry using a facile single-molecular precursor method, and then functionalized with (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane to improve their compatibility with PEVA. These nanocrystals were then melt-mixed into PEVA in a mini-compounder, with the resulting blends extruded and pressed into thin films using a Universal Film Maker and a Carver hydraulic press. Both experimental and commercial greenhouse films were analyzed by electron, confocal and atomic force microscopy, showing that the silane ligand enhanced dispersibility of QDs throughout the PEVA. The bare and core–shell QDs were studied at various loading levels from 0.1% to 0.5%, showing high light transmissions (90%) and decreased UV transmission with increased QD loading.

First, cell efficiency distribution was investigated along a complete mono-like silicon ingot. Advanced electrical characterization was performed in order to understand limiting mechanisms of the final device performances. Fabricated heterojunction cells with the standard industrial compatible process have demonstrated efficiencies comparable to those with our Czochralski grown monocrystalline substrates: over 19% along a large part of the ingot. Moreover, the best wafers were evaluated using our advanced cells process. Very high efficiencies over 21.5% have been obtained, demonstrating the potential of such substrates for very high efficiency solar cells.

Abstract: CuInTe2 (CIT) thin films have been electrochemically deposited from aqueous electrolyte onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. A conventional three-electrode geometry consisting working, counter and reference electrodes was used to perform the electrochemical studies. The deposition potential, −0.75V with respect to Ag/AgCl was optimized by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The as-deposited as well as annealed films were characterized using range of characterization techniques to study the structural, morphological, compositional and optoelectronic properties. Amorphous CIT films have been deposited for all reported potentials, however after heat treatment the polycrystalline films with (112), (220)/(204) and (312)/(116) planes corresponds to tetragonal CIT are observed. After heat treatment the secondary peaks of Indium oxide and Indium telluride with planes (012), (222) and (311) were also observed. Identification of secondary microcrystalline phases and vibration modes of chalcopyrite were studied by using Raman spectroscopy. The most intense line observed in Raman spectra at 123cm−1 is due to the A1 mode, which is generally observed in Raman spectra of I–III–VI2 chalcopyrite structure. Densely packed, adherent and relatively uniform thin films of CIT are deposited for all used growth potentials. The grain size has been improved with heat treatment. Elemental compositional analysis was performed using Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX). Tellurium rich films are deposited for all reported potentials. The final solar cell devices fabricated at optimum deposition potential are tested using solar simulator with 1.5 AM, (100mWcm−2). The cell parameters obtained from J–V characteristics are, Voc=480mV, Jsc=20mA/cm2, FF=43% and η=4.13%. The calculated values of series resistance Rs and Ideality factor A under dark and illuminated conditions are 334/27Ω and 1.43/1.63, respectively.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis accompanying our experimental development of micro-structured thin film polycrystalline silicon solar cell absorbers. Our focus is on 2D-periodic arrays of holes which do not act as a superficial scattering grating but pierce the entire silicon absorber layer. We deviate from the commonly used model of vertical hole sidewalls by employing conical frustum shaped holes with a range of opening angles. Additionally, an experimentally motivated front texture is applied to the simulated solar cell absorbers and varied in texture aspect. Based on this parametric absorber model, for a single domain period of 2μm, we discuss light trapping and optical losses in thin film cells with absorptive front and back contacts and a perfectly transparent glass encapsulation layer. Implications from this study are that light trapping in square periodic arrays with periods larger than the wavelength of light can be enhanced by microholes but that it cannot replace a front texture which provides both antireflection and scattering.

Abstract: Polyamines (PA) are believed to protect DNA minimizing the effect of radiation damage either by inducing DNA compaction and aggregation or acting as scavengers of free radicals. Using an in vitro pDNA double strand breakage assay based on gel electrophoretic mobility, we compared the protective capability of PA against γ-radiation with that of compounds generated by the supramolecular self-assembly of nuclear polyamines and phosphates, named Nuclear Aggregates of Polyamines (NAPs). Both unassembled PA and in vitro produced NAPs (ivNAPs) were ineffective in conferring pDNA protection at the sub-mM concentration. Single PA showed an appreciable protective effect only at high (mM) concentrations. However, concentrations of spermine (4+) within a critical range (0.481mM) induced pDNA precipitation, an event that was not observed with NAPs–pDNA interaction. We conclude that the interaction of individual PA is ineffective to assure DNA protection, simultaneously preserving the flexibility and charge density of the double strand. Furthermore, data obtained by testing polyamine and ivNAPS with the current radiation-induced DNA damage model support the concept that PA-phosphate aggregates are the only forms through which PA interact with DNA.

Abstract: T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, a recently identified CD4+ T subset with a unique characteristic to produce Interleukin-17 (IL-17), are critical for the development of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, in which IL-23 plays an important role in the differentiation of Th17 cells through IL-23/IL-23-receptor/STAT3 pathway. Previously, soluble recombinant human IL-23 receptor cytokine-binding homology region (hIL23R-CHR) was constructed in our laboratory to neutralize IL-23 and inhibit murine Th17 development in vitro. Herein we present that hIL23R-CHR could inhibit both differentiation and function of human/murine Th17 cells. The present in vivo study further demonstrated that hIL23R-CHR inhibited murine Th17 cell development by down regulating IL-17 gene expression and protected mice against the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) through suppression of CNS inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In addition to the in vitro inhibition of human Th17 cells in a dose-dependent manner, the antagonizing effect of hIL23R-CHR was confirmed by reduced levels of IL-23 in both blood and brain of EAE mice and STAT3 phosphorylation in vivo. Taken together, our data demonstrated that hIL23R-CHR could be an effective and specific immunosuppressive molecule for the treatment of Th17-related autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Quantum confined silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) may allow for the fabrication of an all silicon multiple junction photovoltaic cell, or novel photovoltaic cells that surpasses the single junction limitations. One method of growing SiNPs is by PECVD where the plasma is confined to a quartz tube. To further understand this technique, computational fluid dynamic calculation were coupled with experimental growths, which allows for the development of a phase diagram based around the reactor pressure, and gas flow. SiNP size and crystallinity were evaluated using a combination of Raman scattering, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), these results were used to further the develop the phase diagram. For residence times less than 1ms, SiNPs were produced a band gap of >1.6eV, but very low crystallinity. By maintaining a constant low gas flow (100sccm) and increasing reactor pressure, crystallinity and size of the SiNPs were improved and increased, respectively. For SiNPs grown with a constant residence time (~2ms), we observe a reduction in the crystallinity with increased gas flow. Closer inspection by TEM showed a significant amount of a-Si with the SiNPs. Using this growth technique we can reliably grow SiNPs with diameters from 3nm to 8nm, relating to a photoluminescence peak position from 1.6eV to 1.3eV. This range is ideal for the development of an all silicon tandem photovoltaic cell.

Abstract: The implementation of electrochemically deposited zinc oxide nanorod arrays is a promising and cost-effective concept for the improvement of photovoltaic devices. The aim of this study is to analyze the light scattering performance of zinc oxide nanorod arrays for the use in silicon thin-film solar cells. We obtained different array geometries by a variation of the seed layer thickness and the electrochemical deposition parameters. Our results showed that haze values exceeding those of standard commercial textured substrates are feasible. We observed the best diffuse scattering for high, separated nanorods and found that the scattering in the long wavelength range is favored for larger nanorod diameters (>200nm). In addition to the diffuse scattering, the cell reflectivity of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells on nanorod arrays was significantly reduced. The characteristic solar cell parameters suggest that array geometries with diameters of >200nm and low aspect ratios of ≈1–2 are favorable in order to prevent electrical losses.

Abstract: We recently reported the successful replacement of both sputtered intrinsic zinc oxide (i-ZnO) and sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) window layers by a solution processed silver nanowire composite window (SNCW) layer for fully solution processed high performance CuIn(S,Se)2 (CISS) thin film solar cells without any sacrifices in photovoltaic device performance. Here, we report the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fully solution processed CISS thin film solar cells with the SNCW layer under dark conditions, and under white and filtered red-light illumination. While control devices with sputtered conductive metal oxide window layers do not show J–V distortion, devices with the SNCW exhibit both crossover and red kink behaviors, which disappear during white-light illumination but gradually re-appear after turning off light. We propose the following model to explain the above observations. Acceptor-like defects at the CdS/SNCW interface become negatively charged by capturing electrons under dark conditions, but are neutralized by capturing photo-generated holes from the CdS valence band under white-light illumination. The illumination dependent state of the acceptor-like defects leads to the appearance and disappearance of the crossover and red kink from the J–V curves.

Abstract: Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) has been reported to be present on cell membranes of cancer cells but not the normal cells, serving as a potential anti-cancer target. In the present study, a fusion protein containing the GRP78 binding peptide WIFPWIQL and the active fragment of mung bean trypsin inhibitor was constructed, and its targeted anti-tumor effects were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that the fusion protein specifically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells but not in the normal cells. Mechanistically, these anti-tumor effects were attributed to induction of G1 phase arrest and activation of multiple apoptotic pathways. Importantly, the fusion protein could also suppress the growth of xenografted human colorectal carcinoma in vivo. Our study reveals that this fusion protein may be developed as a therapeutic agent for treatment of colon cancer, and holds important implications for developing other anti-cancer peptide drugs.

Abstract: A deflection surface concentrating mirror technology is proposed in this paper. Unlike traditional shaping technologies such as those used to manufacture parabolic mirrors and cylindrical mirrors, this method features no direct contact between the glass surface and the mold during the hot-bending process, freeing the mirror from any subsequent damage. This report primarily discusses the variation in roughness Ra of the ultra clear float glass surface before and after the hot-bending and demonstrates that the loss of ultraviolet and the visible portions of the solar energy spectrum on the concentrating mirror due to scattering may be significantly reduced by adopting this shaping technique and consequently improving the optical performance of the mirrors. Based on the present study, the optical properties of the deflection surface and the influence of the glass size and tailoring schemes on the optical properties were determined. The results established that tailored deflection surfaces could be used as reflective concentrator surfaces, and Fresnel concentrating groups having a high concentration ratio may be constructed by combining multiple deflection surface mirrors. Further, a deflection mirror group prototype was introduced for verification, including its basic parameters and manufacturing cost which would drop remarkably if the mirrors were mass-produced. Thus, the present technique may not only achieve higher optical efficiency than the contact shaping technologies, but also reduce the manufacturing cost significantly, making it widely applicable in the field of high-temperature solar thermal utilization.

Abstract: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels found in the plasma membrane of both excitable and non-excitable cells. Previously we reported that nicotinic receptors containing α7 subunits were present in the outer membranes of mitochondria to regulate the early apoptotic events like cytochrome c release. Here we show that signaling of mitochondrial α7 nicotinic receptors affects intramitochondrial protein kinases. Agonist of α7 nicotinic receptors PNU 282987 (30nM) prevented the effect of phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, which stimulated cytochrome c release in isolated mouse liver mitochondria, and restored the Akt (Ser 473) phosphorylation state decreased by either 90μM Ca2+ or wortmannin. The effect of PNU 282987 was similar to inhibition of calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (upon 90μM Ca2+) or of Src kinase(s) (upon 0.5mM H2O2) and of protein kinase C. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria could be also attenuated by α7 nicotinic receptor antagonist methyllicaconitine or α7-specific antibodies. Allosteric modulator PNU 120526 (1μM) did not improve the effect of agonist PNU 282987. Acetylcholine (1μM) and methyllicaconitine (10nM) inhibited superoxide release from mitochondria measured according to alkalization of Ca2+-containing medium. It is concluded that α7 nicotinic receptors regulate mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation through ion-independent mechanism involving activation of intramitochondrial PI3K/Akt pathway and inhibition of calcium-calmodulin-dependent or Src-kinase-dependent signaling pathways.

Abstract: This paper deals with the impact of dopant compensation on the degradation of carrier lifetime and solar cells performance due to the boron–oxygen defect. The boron–oxygen defect density evaluated by lifetime measurements before and after degradation is systematically found proportional to the total boron concentration, showing that compensation cannot reduce light-induced degradation. This result is confirmed by a comparison of upgraded-metallurgical grade silicon solar cells having identical boron, oxygen and carbon but different compensation levels and in which the degradation is found more severe when the compensation is stronger.

Abstract: Muscle fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP2), a regulatory enzyme of glyconeogenesis, binds to mitochondria where it interacts with proteins involved in regulation of energy homeostasis. Here, we show that the quaternary structure of FBP2 plays a crucial role in this interaction, and that the AMP-driven transition of the FBP2 subunit arrangement from active to inactive precludes its association with the mitochondria. Moreover, we demonstrate that truncation of the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal residues of FBP2 results in a loss of its mitochondria-protective functions. This strengthens the recently raised hypothesis that FBP2 evolved as a regulator not only for glycogen storage but also for mitochondrial function in contracting muscle.

Abstract: The aim of this work was to study the continuous mineralization of antipyrine present in a synthetic municipal wastewater effluent (SE) in a semi-industrial UV/solar compound parabolic collector (CPC) plant using a homogeneous photo-Fenton oxidation assisted with ferrioxalate. Under the selected continuous operating conditions ([H2O2]=750ppm, [Fe]=12ppm, pH=2.7, and [(COOH)2·2H2O]=66.2ppm, flowrate=1200L/h, 77% of TOC is removed when treating an aqueous synthetic effluent containing 50ppm of antipyrine. The use of artificial UV lamps together with solar radiation increases mineralization up to 88%. Determination of the hydrogen peroxide consumed and remaining in the water revealed that 4.7mol of H2O2 were consumed per each mol of total organic carbon removed from solution. The operational costs due to the consumption of reagents and catalysts were calculated from the optimal conditions. The results showed that the ferrioxalate-assisted solar photo-Fenton process was economically feasible with no electric consumption due to the use of photovoltaic panels. Under optimal conditions, a total cost of 2.78cent€/g TOC removed (1.56€/m3) was calculated.

Abstract: Background
This study presents descriptive epidemiological data related to prostate cancer cases diagnosed from 2001 to 2008 among Saudi men, including the frequency and percentage of cases, the crude incidence rate (CIR) and the age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) adjusted by region and year of diagnosis.
Methods
This is a retrospective descriptive epidemiological analysis of all Saudi prostate cancer cases recorded in the Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR) between January 2001 and December 2008. Statistical analyses were conducted using descriptive statistics, the Poisson regression model, a simple linear regression model and analysis of variance with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 (SPSS).
Results
A total of 1739 cases were registered in the SCR between January 2001 and December 2008. The eastern region of Saudi Arabia had the highest overall ASIR at 10.1 per 100,000 men, followed by Riyadh at 7.1 and Makkah at 5.2, while Jizan and Najran had the lowest average ASIRs at 1.4 and at 2.0, respectively. The Poisson regression model for the region of Jizan shows that the incidence rate ratio (IRR) was significantly higher (p<0.001); for the regions of Riyadh at 3.43 times (95% CI, 3.13–3.73), followed by Makkah at 2.56 (95% CI, 2.38–2.74) and the eastern province at 1.93 (95% CI, 1.64–2.23). The annual prediction of the CIR of prostate cancer in Saudi Arabia could be defined by the equation 1.53+(0.094×Years), and the prediction of the ASIR could be defined by the equation 2.98+(0.182×Years).
Conclusion
There was a steady increase in the CIRs and ASIRs for prostate cancer between 2001 and 2008. The eastern region, Riyadh and Makkah had the highest overall ASIR in Saudi Arabia. Further effective screening programmes and active treatment measures are needed to control prostate cancer disease among Saudi men.

MiR-144 regulates hematopoiesis and vascular development by targeting meis1 during zebrafish development,

Abstract: Hematopoiesis is a dynamic process by which peripheral blood lineages are developed. It is a process tightly regulated by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including transcriptional factors and signaling molecules. However, the epigenetic regulation of hematopoiesis, for example, regulation via microRNAs (miRNAs), remains incompletely understood. Here we show that miR-144 regulates hematopoiesis and vascular development in zebrafish. Overexpression of miR-144 inhibited primitive hematopoiesis as demonstrated by a reduced number of circulating blood cells, reduced o-dianisidine staining of hemoglobin, and reduced expression of hbαe1, hbβe1, gata1 and pu.1. Overexpression of miR-144 also inhibited definitive hematopoiesis as shown by reduced expression of runx1 and c-myb. Mechanistically, miR-144 regulates hematopoiesis by repressing expression of meis1 involved in hematopoiesis. Both real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analyses showed that overexpression of miR-144 repressed expression of meis1. Bioinformatic analysis predicts a target binding sequence for miR-144 at the 3′-UTR of meis1. Deletion of the miR-144 target sequence eliminated the repression of meis1 expression mediated by miR-144. The miR-144-mediated abnormal phenotypes were partially rescued by co-injection of meis1 mRNA and could be almost completely rescued by injection of both meis1 and gata1 mRNA. Finally, because meis1 is involved in vascular development, we tested the effect of miR-144 on vascular development. Overexpression of miR-144 resulted in abnormal vascular development of intersegmental vessels in transgenic zebrafish with Flk1p-EGFP, and the defect was rescued by co-injection of meis1 mRNA. These findings establish miR-144 as a novel miRNA that regulates hematopoiesis and vascular development by repressing expression of meis1.

Abstract: A planar heterojunction organic solar cell (OSC) with high internal quantum efficiency (IQE=95.6% at 590nm) was demonstrated based on boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc) and C60 as the electron donor and acceptor materials. A thin layer of N,N-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene (mCP), acting as an electron and exciton blocking layer, was inserted between the ITO anode and the SubPc layer to prevent leakage current and exciton quenching. In the optimized device, a mCP thickness of 3nm was thick enough to block the excitons (as suggested by a high IQE and longer-lived photoluminescence), resulting in an open circuit voltage of 1.09V, a short circuit current of 7.87mA/cm2, a fill factor of 59, and a power conversion efficiency of 5.08%. Increasing the mCP thickness resulted in increased serial resistance and SubPc crystallization that reduced the fill factor, VOC, and JSC. Due to the narrow absorption band of SubPC (71nm at the full-width-at-half-maximum), this high performance (both in peak IQE and VOC) device has the potential to be used as a subcell in a spectral splitting solar cell module.

Abstract: Connexin 26 (Cx26), a protein involved in gap junctional intercellular communication, has an essential function during organ and tissue development. Its deregulation, in part due to inherent mutations, is associated with pathological conditions including congenital deafness. Regulation of Cx26 protein level is critical for its function but the molecular mechanisms involved are partially understood. This study identifies dynamin 2 (Dyn2) as a Cx26 interactor in yeast and mammalian cells. Deletion studies revealed that Cx26–Dyn2 interaction involves the C-terminus of Cx26 and the GTPase effector domain of Dyn2, which is of particular importance for the regulation of the endocytic pathway. Dyn2 inhibition using siRNA or dynasore resulted in reduced Cx26 degradation at the plasma membrane and this was associated with change in gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). Furthermore, we demonstrate that Dyn2 regulates Cx26 endocytosis and ubiquitination. These results establish Dyn2 as a Cx26 partner in the regulation of GJIC.

Abstract: Several lines of evidence suggest that a tympanosclerotic (TMS) lesion often develops secondary to acute and chronic otitis media. Histological findings indicate that fibroblasts and inflammatory cells, including mast cells, play a key role in the tympanosclerotic plaque formation. However, details on the functional characteristics of tympanosclerotic fibroblasts (FsTMS) are scanty. Therefore the aim of our study was to examine the activity of human fibroblasts from tympanosclerotic lesions and to evaluate the influence of stimulated by crosslinking of IgE receptor mast cells (HMC-1FcɛRI) on fibroblast functional behavior. We observed that fibroblasts from normal tympanic membrane (FsTM) released less TNF-α, TGF-β1 and IL-6 compared to FsTMS. FsTMS but not FsTM upon interaction with HMC-1FcɛRI released increased quantities of TNF-α and TGF-β1. Exposing the fibroblast to HMC-1FcɛRI cells resulted in an increased synthesis of proteins including collagen. We noted that the COL2A1 transcript level increased ∼5- and ∼12-fold in FsTM and FsTMS co-cultured with HMC-1FcɛRI, respectively. Both FsTM and FsTMS upon maintenance in the primary culture released significant quantities of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). However, FsTMS released ∼5-fold more MMP-9 activity compared to the FsTM cultures. The mast cell-induced release of TNF-α, TGF-β1 and MMP-9 sustained for a longer time in FsTMS cultures compared to FsTM. Concluding, our data strongly indicate that increased fibroblast sensitivity to mast cell stimulation greatly contributes to the excessive fibrosis and pathological remodeling of the tympanic membrane. We postulate that the persistency of the FsTMS activated state could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of tympanosclerosis.

Abstract: The tumor protein 53 (p53) gene played a crucial role in maternal reproduction except its classic roles in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis. However, little is known concerning the regulatory elements which control the expression of p53 gene. In this study, we predicted two binding sites (−490/−477 and −405/−392) of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) within the core promoter (−985/−273) determined by promoter deletion analysis, and discovered that the second site (−405/−392) was important for p53 promoter activity by site-directed mutagenesis. Then the binding of C/EBPβ to the p53 promoter was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Moreover, evidence from C/EBPβ overexpression and RNAi studies showed C/EBPβ regulated p53 promoter activity and endogenous p53 expression. Meanwhile, we observed p53 mRNA at the peak in 10−6mol/L 17β-estradiol treated cells for 24h via enhancing its core promoter activity. Taken together, our study indicates that C/EBPβ and 17β-estradiol are the essential regulatory factors for p53 transcription.

Abstract: Flexible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) thin-film solar cells have received much attention for power generation in space applications. This is due to their superior radiation hardness and a high specific power. A significant drawback lies in the low emissivity ε of the CIGSe solar cells, which leads to an increase in the cell temperature during operation in space and a decrease in the efficiency. To overcome this problem, optical coatings like SiO2 or Al2O3, that provide high emissivity, have to be applied on the solar cells. It is well known, that silica-like coatings can be formed at relatively low temperatures by the use of polysilazanes. Thus, this paper reports on the development, processing and characterisation of high emissivity coatings based on the polysilazanes PHPS and HTTS for flexible CIGSe thin-film solar cells. Therefore, the conversion behaviour, the coating properties like the coating thickness and microstructure, the solar absorbance as well as the emissivity of coated cells were investigated. The ability as high-ε coatings could be proved by optical reflection measurements showing a significant increase of the emissivity from 0.34 for an uncoated CIGSe cell to 0.78 for a HTTS-coated solar cell.

Abstract: Low-refractive-index and high-transmittance silicon oxide (SiOx) with a mixed phase of n-type microcrystalline silicon was developed for intermediate reflector layers (IRLs) of high-efficiency amorphous Si and microcrystalline-Si tandem solar cells. The refractive index, crystalline fraction, and conductivity of the SiOx IRLs were characterized as functions of the deposition conditions. The SiOx films were prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, at a high pressure of 9Torr and high hydrogen dilution ratio of 400, and using a narrow electrode gap of 12mm. The films showed a refractive index of 1.85, crystalline fraction of ~50%, and conductivity of ~10−7S/cm. Furthermore, the transmittance of the films was more than 90% at wavelengths between 600nm and 1100nm. We present here the procedure to optimize the SiOx IRLs, which is to compare the changes in the top and bottom cells' current densities of the tandem solar cells fabricated with 10–20% thinner absorption layers. A stabilized efficiency of 11.12% and light-induced degradation of −9.3% could be achieved in a tandem module containing an optimized IRL by enhancing the top cell current. The SiOx IRLs developed and the optimization procedure discussed in this paper can be very useful for the fabrication of high-efficiency thin-film Si tandem modules.

Abstract: For applications to harvest solar energy, it is essential to characterize upconverter materials under broad-band excitation at reasonable irradiance levels achievable by concentration of solar radiation. We present a method to determine the absolute upconversion quantum yield (UCQY) under broad-band excitation by photoluminescence measurements. We introduce a spectral mismatch correction that allows calculating the UCQY that can be expected under illumination with the solar spectrum with a certain solar concentration. Applying these methods to β-NaYF4 doped with 25%Er3+, we determine an external UCQY of 2.0% in the spectral range from 1450nm to 1600nm under a comparatively low solar concentration of only 50suns. This value corresponds to a potential increase of the short-circuit current density of 3.89mA/cm2. Subsequently, we measure the external quantum efficiency due to upconversion of sub-band-gap photons for a bifacial silicon solar cell with upconverter attached to its rear side under the same broad-band excitation. We determine an additional short-circuit current density due to upconversion of 4.03mA/cm2 for a solar concentration of only 77suns. This value agrees very well, with the expected additional short-circuit current density due to upconversion, calculated from the external UCQY values as determined by the photoluminescence measurements, by considering the transmittance of the solar cell for sub-band-gap photons and the external quantum efficiency of the solar cell for photons emitted by the upconverter. Finally, a comparison with different literature values based on a set of figures of merit shows that our results currently constitute the largest enhancement of the short-circuit current density due to upconversion.

Abstract: Solar reflectance (R) of roofing materials is a function of irradiance magnitude and direction, and surface properties. Current methods of labeling the surface reflectance are applicable to homogeneous materials. However, reflectivity of recently developed directional reflective materials (DRM) has a strong dependence on the heterogeneity of the surface. We have developed a model to calculate the hourly reflectance of DRMs as a function of zenith and azimuth angles. We investigate options to represent the reflectance of DRMs. Two main options are proposed for labeling; (1) Option 1: using one reflectance for the whole year, and (2) Option 2: using seasonal reflectance (a number representing summer reflectance, a number representing winter reflectance, and the mean of the winter and summer reflectances for other months of a year). We propose a simple method based on Option 2 to label the solar reflectance of DRMs. The proposed option assigns the average reflectance of DRMs as the winter reflectance and the reflectance of the DRM according to a 20° zenith toward the reflective side as the summer reflectance. In summer, the selected metric estimates the mean hourly heat absorption and energy saving for building energy models accurately, and peak heat absorption of the surface by 8% (<40W/m2) error. In winter, the potential energy savings of buildings is overestimated by an error of less than 20%, and mean hourly and peak heat absorptions are estimated by an error of 22kJ/m2 and 9W/m2, respectively.

Abstract: Therapies to reverse the vascular endothelial aging process may play as a novel strategy for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-EET) is a predominant cytochrome P450 epoxygenases-derived arachidonic acid metabolite and possesses multiple biological effects on the vascular system. The present study sought to investigate the roles of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)/Akt signaling pathways in mediating the effect of 14,15-EET on endothelial senescence. By measuring the isometric tension in rat mesenteric arteries, we demonstrated that 14,15-EET improved the impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in aged rats through activating mTORC2/Akt signaling pathway. Meanwhile, by promoting the formation of mTORC2 and the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473), 14,15-EET inhibited the senescence of rat mesenteric arterial endothelial cells, which was not influenced by rapamycin but was significantly attenuated by Akt1/2 kinase inhibitor. The knockdown of Rictor gene by RNA interference abolished the inhibitory effect of 14,15-EET on endothelial senescence. Furthermore, 14,15-EET down-regulated the expression of p53 protein in aged endothelial cells. Meanwhile, the nuclear translocation of telomerase reverse transcriptase and the nuclear telomerase activity were also enhanced by treatment with 14,15-EET. Therefore, our present study suggests the crucial role of mTORC2/Akt signaling pathways in the inhibitory effects of 14,15-EET on the endothelial senescence. Our findings reveal important mechanistic clues to understanding of the effects of 14,15-EET on the endothelial functions.

Abstract: By introducing silver nanoparticles (NPs) and SiO2 spacer layers on top of Si-based Schottky barrier solar cells, we demonstrated a positive and tunable light trapping effect introduced by metallic NPs. A redshift of the surface plasmon resonant wavelength of Ag NPs from 550nm to 650nm, corresponding to the optical absorption peak of the solar cell, was observed with an increased average particle diameter from 19.7nm to 85nm. Enhanced light trapping effects at distinct resonance wavelengths were observed in the optical spectra of the plasmonic-enhanced devices. Electrical measurements confirmed the expected photocurrent improvement at these corresponding wavelengths. It was also revealed that the Ag NPs enhance the carrier generation rate inside of the Si active layer without sacrificing carrier collection efficiency of the device. The short-circuit current density of the best cell we obtained in this work was improved from 13.7mA/cm2 to 19.7mA/cm2, with an enhancement factor of 43.7%.

Abstract: Microencapsulated palmitic acid (PA) with titanium dioxide (TiO2) shell as shape-stabilized thermal energy storage material was synthesized through a sol–gel process. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to determine the morphology, chemical structure, crystalloid phase and chemical state of the microcapsules, respectively. The thermal properties and thermal stability were investigated by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The microcapsules have relatively spherical shape and average size of 200–400nm. The FT-IR, XRD and XPS results showed that the PA was well encapsulated in the TiO2 shell. The DSC results indicated that the typical microcapsules melt at 61.7°C with a latent heat of 63.3kJ/kg and solidify at 56.7°C with a latent heat of 47.1kJ/kg. The TGA results confirmed that the microcapsules have good thermal stability, resulting from the TiO2 shells. Based on all results, it can be concluded that the prepared microcapsules have good energy storage potential due to their non-inflammability, nontoxicity and good thermal stability.

Abstract: To investigate the potential clinical application of aptamers to prevention of HIV infection, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers specific for CD4 were developed using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment approach and next generation sequencing. In contrast to RNA-based aptamers, the developed ssDNA aptamers were stable in human serum up to 12h. Cell binding assays revealed that the aptamers specifically targeted CD4-expressing cells with high binding affinity (Kd=1.59nM), a concentration within the range required for therapeutic application. Importantly, the aptamers selectively bound CD4 on human cells and disrupted the interaction of viral gp120 to CD4 receptors, which is a prerequisite step of HIV-1 infection. Functional studies showed that the aptamer polymers significantly blocked binding of viral gp120 to CD4-expressing cells by up to 70% inhibition. These findings provide a new approach to prevent HIV-1 transmission using oligonucleotide aptamers.

Abstract: New cathode interlayers based on a water soluble cationic polyacrylamide (C-PAM) with a viscosity-averaged molecular weight of 3 million were introduced as cathode interlayers in inverted solar cells. The neat C-PAM and 5% CsF doped C-PAM thin layers on ITO substrate could decrease the work-function of ITO and hence lead to suitable energy level alignments for efficient electron collection. Obvious enhancements of energy conversion efficiency as well as air-stability were found, in comparison to well-known ZnO interlayer based device. The possible factors involving deteriorations at two interfaces of ITO/interlayer and interlayer/active layer during more than 1 year storage under an ambient condition were analyzed. Our results suggest that the interlayer polymer with giant molecular size and numerous side groups of hydrophilic amide and quaternary ammonium would facilitate the formations of large and intimate single-molecular binding area with the ITO substrate and the upper active layer, and might afford more reliable interfacial contacts to resist possible moisture- and/or stress-induced delamination. Therefore, hydrophilic polymer with an ultra-high molecular weight would be an ideal cathode interlayer for efficient and air-stable inverted solar cells.

Abstract: Fresnel lenses made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) represent a cost-effective approach for concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) panels. The lens must sustain suitable working performance during the whole lifetime of the photovoltaic plant, as UV photodegradation is the main issue to be avoided. In this work, PMMA sheets were covered with a hybrid organic–inorganic sol–gel coating consisting of a matrix of an organically modified silicate (ORMOSIL) in which CeO2 nanoparticles 10–20nm in size were dispersed, acting as the UV-absorbing agent. Ceria contents up to 40% w/w were studied and blended with the precursor ORMOSIL solution before deposition and in-situ polymerization at 80°C. The UV–visible spectra were analyzed between 200 and 800nm. Furthermore, the effect of the aging on outdoor weathering was investigated for the coated PMMA sheets and compared to the unprotected sample. The results show that a load of 30% w/w of ceria nanoparticles provides a reasonable compromise in terms of UV protection and absorption in the visible range. The weathering test also demonstrates enhanced protection against UV degradation for the coated PMMA sheet compared to the bare substrate, although the adherence should be further improved for optimum performance.

Abstract: Background and objectives
This study aims to examine the possible association of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and to shed light on the epidemiology of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in Jordan.
Patients and methods
We examined 100 consecutive cases of HL for the presence of EBV in tumor cells by immunohistochemistry for latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1). We collected patient data on age, sex and histologic subtype. We reviewed the pathological findings in each case and confirmed diagnosis.
Results
Nodular lymphocyte predominant HL was diagnosed in 6% of the cases and these were negative for EBV LMP-1. Of the 94 cases of cHL, 65% were males, the most common subtype was nodular sclerosis (NS), representing 70% of the cases, and 45.7% of cHL (43% of all HL) cases were positive for EBV LMP-1. The positive cases were significantly related to age: ⩽15years and >51years (p: 0.009 and 0.014 respectively), male gender (p: 0.03) and mixed cellularity (MC) subtype (p: <0.0001). In line with other developing countries, there also appears to be a trend towards a decreasing association of EBV with cHL and a subtype switch from MC to NS in Jordan.
Conclusion
The epidemiology of HL in Jordan and some developing countries is approaching that of developed countries.

Abstract: In this study, we systematically investigated the stoichiometric dependence of titanium oxide (TiOx, x=1.56–1.93) as a cathode modifier on the device performance of polymer solar cells. Electronic structures of the synthesized TiOx modifier layers were controlled by tuning the compositions of various O/Ti ratios. The effective cathode work-functions and the corresponding device performances of polymer solar cells are systematically changed as a result of inserting the TiOx modification layers. Interfacial modification of the Al cathode with a low O/Ti ratio of TiOx layer yields the best performing photovoltaic device as a result of a largest built-in potential. The correlation of power conversion efficiencies and carrier dynamics of these devices by inserting various TiOx modification layer is further examined by using the Mott-Schottky analysis and the impedance spectroscopy technique. The consistent result shows an enhanced carrier collection efficiency and a reduced charge recombination rate of the device via adequate band alignment between the photoactive layer and the cathode using the TiOx modification layer with an optimized O/Ti ratio.

Abstract: The cytokine resistin and the chemokine fractalkine (FKN) were found at increased levels in human atherosclerotic plaque, in the subendothelium, but their role in this location still needs to be characterized. Recently, high local resistin in the arterial vessel wall was shown to contribute to an enhanced accumulation of macrophages by mechanisms that need to be clarified. Our recent data showed that resistin activated smooth muscle cells (SMC) by up-regulating FKN and MCP-1 expression and monocyte chemotaxis by activating toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and Gi/o proteins. Since in the vessel wall both endothelial cells (EC) and SMC respond to cytokines and promote atherosclerosis, we questioned whether subendothelial resistin (sR) has a role in vascular cells cross-talk leading to enhanced monocyte transmigration and we investigated the mechanisms involved. To this purpose we used an in vitro system of co-cultured SMC and EC activated by sR and we analyzed monocyte transmigration. Our results indicated that: (1) sR enhanced monocyte transmigration in EC/SMC system compared to EC cultured alone; (2) sR activated TLR4 and Gi/o signaling in EC/SMC system and induced the secretion of more FKN and MCP-1 compared to EC cultured alone and used both chemokines to specifically recruit monocytes by CX3CR1 and CCR2 receptors. Moreover, FKN produced by resistin in EC/SMC system, by acting on CX3CR1 on EC/SMC specifically contributes to MCP-1 secretion in the system and to the enhanced monocyte transmigration. Our study indicates new possible targets for therapy to reduce resistin-dependent enhanced macrophage infiltration in the atherosclerotic arterial wall.

Abstract: S100A6 is a calcium binding protein belonging to the S100 family. In this work we examined the function of extracellular S100A6. Using mesenchymal stem cells isolated from Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord (WJMS cells) we have shown that S100A6 is secreted by these cells, and when added to the medium, increases their adhesion and inhibits proliferation. The search for a potential target/receptor of S100A6 in the membrane fraction of WJMS cells allowed us to identify some proteins, among them integrin β1, which interacts with S100A6 in a calcium dependent manner. The interaction between S100A6 and integrin β1, was then confirmed by ELISA using purified proteins. Applying specific antibodies against integrin β1 reversed the effect on cell adhesion and proliferation observed in the presence of S100A6 which indicates that S100A6 exerts its function due to interaction with integrin β1. Since the data show the influence of extracellular S100A6 on cells isolated from Wharton's jelly, our results might help to establish molecular mechanisms leading to some pathologies characteristic for this tissue.

Abstract: Regulation of protein activity by phosphorylation is central in many cellular processes. Phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues is well documented and studied. In addition, other amino acids, like histidine can be phosphorylated, but neither the mechanism nor the function of this modification is well understood. Nevertheless, there is a 14kDa enzyme with phosphohistidine phosphatase activity, named PHPT1, found in most animals, but not in bacteria, plant or fungi. There are a few splice variant transcripts formed from the human PHPT1 locus and some of them are predicted to form variant proteins, but studies of these proteins are lacking. In order to get insight into the possible function of the variant transcripts encoded at the PHPT1 locus, ectopic expression of PHPT1 transcript variant 6, predicted to be degraded by the non-sense mediated mRNA decay pathway, in HeLa cells was undertaken. In HeLa cells the splice variant protein was degraded by the proteasome, unlike the wild type protein. Using an in silico modeling approach the variant C-terminal end of the proteins were predicted to form different secondary structures that might explain the different properties of the two proteins. The specific degradation of the PHPT1 splice variant indicates that at least for the PHPT1 protein, the quality control and the self-guarding of the cellular system works at two levels, first at the RNA level, aberrant transcripts are degraded by the non-sense mediated mRNA decay pathway, and the small amount of proteins that are formed will be degraded by the proteasome.

Abstract: Thin film solar cells with a structure of ZnO/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS)/Mo were fabricated successfully by sulfurization of co-electrodeposited Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors at 590°C for 15min. The best solar cell performance was achieved with an efficiency of 5.5% (VOC=673.8mV, JSC=18.7mAcm−2, FF=44%). The vibrational properties and phase identification of the absorber were studied by the polarised Raman and IR spectra. The CZTS absorber layer shows a bi-layered structure comprising of a well-crystallized photovoltaic layer with metallic ratios of Cu/Zn=1.95 and Zn/Sn=1.56 and a particulate-like bottom layer with a heavily Sn poor content. These particulates in the bottom CZTS layer feature with a high density of stacking faults along with ZnS phases and contribute to the low minority lifetime, the high recombination losses, and the increased series resistances in the device. In the well-crystallized CZTS absorber layer the trace of a twin defect on {112} plane is discovered. Dark electrical analysis indicates there is a relatively small energy barrier height of 44meV across the cell.

Abstract: Background
Cancer and its treatment are recognized risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are utilized to provide mechanical thromboprophylaxis to prevent pulmonary embolism (PE) or to avoid bleeding from systemic anticoagulation.
Patients and methods
A retrospective analysis of 107 cancer patients who had IVC filters inserted and followed up at our institution was performed. All patients had active cancer; a majority (> 90%) had advanced-stage disease, whereas only five patients (5.8%) had stages I or II disease.
Results
Eighty six patients (80.3%) had their IVC filter placed through a jugular approach. Filter insertion was not without complications; recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was reported in 10 (9.3%), PE in three (2.8%) and filter thrombosis in one patient. The value of IVC filter in patients with advanced stage disease was very limited: among 59 patients with stage IV disease for whom survival data was available, the median survival was only 1.31months (0.92–2.20) with 23 patients (39.0%) surviving less than a month, and 40 (67.8%) surviving less than three months.
Conclusions
Systemic anticoagulation can be safely offered for the majority of cancer patients. When the risk of bleeding or PE is high, IVC filters can be utilized. However, the placement of such filters should take into consideration the stage of disease and life expectancy of such patients. Patients with advanced-stage disease may gain little benefit from IVC filter insertion.

Here we study the role of Syndecan-4 (SDC4), a cell-surface heparan sulphate proteoglycan, and Fibronectin (FN), in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mammalian cell lines and Xenopus embryos demonstrate that SDC4 and FN inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Epistatic and biochemical experiments show that this inhibition occurs at the cell membrane level through regulation of LRP6. R-spondin 3, a ligand that promotes canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling, is more prone to potentiate Wnt/β-catenin signaling when SDC4 levels are reduced, suggesting a model whereby SDC4 tunes the ability of R-spondin to modulate the different Wnt signaling pathways. Since SDC4 has been previously related to non-canonical Wnt signaling, our results also suggest that this proteoglycan can be a key component in the regulation of Wnt signaling.

Abstract: We propose a cost-effective, low-temperature antireflective coating for the outer glass substrates of 1.43m2 thin-film Si photovoltaic modules using a WO3–TiO2 nanoparticle photocatalyst. The coated nanoporous films provide the broadband antireflective effect, which results in the increased initial performances. Notably, the self-cleaning effect due to the photo-induced superhydrophilicity leads to a significantly reduced outdoor-exposed degradation. Therefore, the drastic energy output gain of 4.3% is achieved for a tandem photovoltaic module via a long-term outdoor field test.

Abstract: Effective control of the morphology can enhance the performance of organic photovoltaics. The morphology of an active layer needs to have a large interfacial area between donors and acceptors for efficient exciton dissociation and continuous, direct charge transport paths to electrodes for high charge transport efficiency. These two requirements are usually contradictory. Here, we propose a morphology that meets these requirements nearly simultaneously, called an inter-diffused ordered bulk heterojunction (IDOBHJ). This novel structure exhibited 9% higher performance based on the Monte Carlo simulation than an optimized disordered bulk heterojunction. The main reasons for superior performance were attributed to the comparable short circuit current density and a higher fill factor. We also implemented the IDOBHJ morphology by the experimental nanoimprint technique combined with thermal annealing process to confirm simulation results. Our experimental results are indeed consistent with the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Stimulated by the extreme market conditions, the increase in performance and the reduction of manufacturing costs of standard crystalline silicon solar cells and modules have been quite significant in the last years. This progress was achieved mainly by process and material improvements avoiding additional process complexity. As todays cells are predominantly limited by optical and recombination losses at the rear surface, dielectric rear surface passivation represents an obvious approach to overcome the limitations. In recent years several concepts have been developed to implement dielectric rear side passivation into industrial-scale mass production. In this paper a short review is given about the evolution of dielectric rear side passivation technologies as well as on state-of-the-art cell and module results. Simple and cost effective cell and module designs utilizing standard as well as innovative manufacturing technologies are presented. Furthermore, it is shown that for all major steps multiple process options are available to further reduce the manufacturing costs. Using an optimized emitter and screen-printed metallization on commercially available 156mm×156mm p-type Czochralski-grown crystalline silicon wafers best cell efficiencies of 19.9% without dielectric rear surface passivation and 21.0% with dielectric rear surface passivation are demonstrated. Replacing the screen-printed front contacts by electroplated nickel–copper contacts record efficiencies of up to 21.3% are reached. By optimizing the module design and materials to reduce the resistive and optical losses, a peak module power of up to 306W and 19.5% aperture area efficiency are achieved.

Abstract: Conducting Probe AFM. CP-AFM, was used to follow how chemical etching, oxidation, and sulfurization affect the surface nanoscale electrical characteristics of polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin films. Band bending at grain boundaries (GBs) on the surface was studied and analyzed by CP-AFM – measured photocurrents. We find that both oxidation and sulfurization can passivate the GBs of the CIGS films; oxidation increases n-type band bending, which impedes the transport of photogenerated electrons, while sulfurization increases p-type band bending at GBs, which helps this transport. Differences in effects between surface terminations by sulfide, selenide and oxide were analyzed. The effects of these treatments on the electrical activity of the GBs of the films, as well as the importance of the use of chemical bath deposition of the CdS buffer, are explained within a defect surface chemistry model.

Abstract: Control poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) or PEDOT and PEDOT/Cu hybrid films were synthesized by electropolymerization. Control PEDOT films have a granular morphology whereas the PEDOT/Cu hybrid films have a fibrillar structure wherein Cu fibers with a face centered cubic lattice are juxtaposed with amorphous polymer particles. The electrical conductivity of the PEDOT/Cu hybrid was found to be 62 times greater and the electrochemical charge storage capacity was superior compared to control PEDOT. The Cu fibers also introduce plasmonic effects which enhance light absorption and induce an appreciable increment in the coloration efficiency of PEDOT from 391cm2C−1 in the control film to 481cm2C−1 in the hybrid (λ=550nm). Faster bleaching kinetics of the order of sub-seconds, higher diffusion coefficient for fluoroalkylphosphate anions and lower charge transfer resistances at the film/electrolyte interface observed in the PEDOT/Cu hybrid relative to control PEDOT are proofs for the conductive and plasmonic effects bestowed by the Cu fibers. The PEDOT/Cu hybrid endures 1000 cycles of coloration and bleaching, without undergoing any significant deterioration in optical contrast, thus demonstrating the applicability of PEDOT/Cu films for transmissive electrochromic devices like smart windows.

Abstract: Spray process under an electric field was used for the deposition of zinc oxide (ZnO) electron transport layer by applying a DC voltage to the nozzle in order to make the layer smoother, highly crystalline and defect free having good electrical and optical properties. The nanostructure formed differed from that in the spray deposited ZnO layer without applying any voltage. The photovoltaic performance of the inverted organic solar cells (IOSC – ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag) made using the nanostructured layer (deposited with the applied voltage=1000V) and the cell stability were found to improve in comparison with the devices made using the nanostructured layer with the applied voltage=0V. A change in the surface morphology of ZnO layer occurred with time and its effect on the cell performance was investigated. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra as well as XPS spectra showed that defects related mainly to oxygen vacancies were reduced in the spray deposited ZnO layer with the applied voltage=1000V. This resulted in a higher IOSC efficiency (~2.7%) and good stability for a long duration (~105 days) with only 20% degradation in PCE. On the other hand, there was a 46% degradation in PCE of IOSC using spray deposited ZnO layer without applying voltage.

Abstract: Purpose
Sorafenib is considered a standard of care in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its combination with gemcitabine, a pyrimidine analogue with limited friendly hepatic profile may prove beneficial in advanced HCC. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a sorafenib and gemcitabine combination in patients with advanced HCC.
Methods
This was a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm, multi-centric Phase II study conducted in Pakistan where 30 treatment-naive patients aged between 26 and 73years with Child–Pugh score A or B were treated with sorafenib (400mg oral) twice daily for 16weeks along with gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 intravenous) administered on day 1 and day 8 of a four-week cycle for 16weeks.
Results
Of the 18 patients (60%) who completed all four cycles of treatment, eight patients had stable disease, two had partial response, and eight had progressive disease. There was no complete response. The most common (⩾10% patients) treatment-emergent adverse events were gemcitabine-related thrombocytopenia (40%) followed by sorafenib-related hand–foot skin reaction and anorexia (33% each).
Conclusion
The efficacy of sorafenib gemcitabine combination therapy is similar to the sorafenib alone treatment. However, frequent dose adjustments due to gemcitabine-related toxicities, delays, and corrective treatments make this combination therapy unsafe in the treatment of advanced HCC.

Abstract: Novel electrolytes composed of a sol–gel derived di-urethane cross-linked poly(ε-caprolactone) (d-PCL(530))/siloxane (where 530 is the average molecular weight in gmol−1) biohybrid network doped with a 50:50molar mixture of lithium and erbium triflates were prepared in the light of the “mixed cation effect”. These environmentally friendly electrolytes, which are multi-wavelength emitters from the UV/VIS to the NIR spectral regions, are attractive candidates for electrochromic devices. Prototype devices based on a glass/ITO/WO3/electrolyte/ITO/glass layered configuration exhibited fast switching speed, high electrochromic reversibility and cyclic stability, along with good coloration efficiency and open circuit memory. The visible average transmittance variation and the optical density change attained were 41.6% and 0.39, respectively. The combined use of these electrolytes with transparent conducting oxides in the VIS and NIR spectral regions opens exciting new prospects for the fabrication of electrochromic windows exhibiting NIR emission and improved performance in terms of energy efficiency in buildings. In addition, these electrolytes offer new possibilities for the production of dual light emitting and electrochromic windows.

Abstract: The influence of doping with bismuth ions in the properties of synthesized Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films was investigated via the solution coating process followed by a selenization step. The incorporation of bismuth ions in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 significantly increased the size of the grains in the obtained films. The intermediate compound of bismuth copper oxide was thought to react with selenium vapor to form copper bismuth selenide, which acted as a flux agent at elevated temperatures. The low-temperature photoluminescence spectra of bismuth-containing Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films revealed attenuated intensity of the peak that was attributed to the donor–acceptor pair transition following the incorporation of bismuth. The donor–acceptor transition is caused by the selenium deficiency. Doping with bismuth ions reduced the amounts of the selenium deficiencies in the films. The incorporation of bismuth ions increased the open-circuit voltage and the fill factor of solar cells by increasing the carrier concentration and reducing the resistivity. The efficiency of solar cells increased from 4.37 to 6.29% as bismuth-ion doping f was increased from 0 to 1.0mol%, revealing that the properties of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber layers were effectively improved via the addition of bismuth ions.

Abstract: We present an improved method that uses photoluminescence images to calculate the spatially-resolved efficiency in addition to other performance parameters of silicon solar cells. This new method is simpler than our previously-presented two-diode method, using only one diode with a variable ideality factor. Experimental results show that the simplified method is more tolerant of very large variations in local series resistance, a characteristic commonly seen in silicon cells. Using dark lock-in thermography techniques, we quantitatively verify the efficiency images produced by our improved method.

Abstract: We report that Ce3+ can be an efficient sensitizer for Yb3+ and a broadband absorber for blue solar spectra. The broadband excitation for near-infrared (NIR) emission is ranged from 350nm to 500nm. The allowed 4f→5d transition and the adjustable lowest 5d level make the energy transfer from Ce3+ to Yb3+ efficiently. Therefore the quantum efficiency (QE) is also very high up to 154.3%. Furthermore, the energy of Yb3+2F7/2→2F5/2 transition matches well with the band gap of a single-junction Si. Given the broad excitation band, high absorption coefficient and excellent mechanical, thermal, and chemical stability, this system can be used as down-conversion (DC) layer for solar cells.

Abstract: A high performance distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) fabricated using the single indium tin oxide (ITO) material is proposed for light trapping in thin-film solar cells. The large index contrast of the ITO DBRs was obtained by depositing alternating layers of dense ITO films and porous ITO films. The high refractive index of the dense ITO films was achieved by long-throw radio-frequency magnetron sputtering technique at room temperature. On the other hand, the porous ITO films with low refractive index were formed by applying supercritical CO2 (SCCO2) treatment at 60°C on gel-coated ITO thin films. Porous structures were obtained with the SCCO2 treatment to volatilize or extract organic matters from the films. The index contrast of the ITO bilayers was higher than 0.5 at blue and green spectral ranges. In addition, small deviations on the optical thickness of the ITO bilayers were observed during the DBR stacking processes. For the DBR comprising 4 periods ITO bilayers, the reflectance and sheet resistance of 87.9% and 35Ω/□ were achieved at 426nm.

Abstract: Renewable and clean energy sources are getting more important. Therefore, a resource-saving alternative to conventional solar concentrators has been designed. This pneumatic pre-stressed concentrator is completely made of polymer films. Due to its pre-stressed construction the mechanical properties of the transparent film have a high influence on the lifetime of the concentrator. The dimension stability of the film significantly affects the effectiveness of the systems due to the shift of the focus point of the reflected radiation after deformation. Therefore, special requirements concerning thermal and mechanical properties in the application relevant temperature range have to be fulfilled. The aim of this work is to characterise fluoropolymer films as transparent layers in a pneumatic pre-stressed sun concentrator. Fluoropolymers have been chosen due to their excellent optical and mechanical properties and their extraordinary stability against ultraviolet radiation. A total of five different fluoropolymer films have been selected and their thermal, mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties at application relevant temperatures were characterised. Even though no material complies with the requirements, an ethylene-tetrafluorethylene-copolymer (ETFE) is suggested, with the recommendation to adapt and adjust the film thickness and the production process to influence the morphology and subsequently the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the material.

Abstract: Tumor specific immune regulatory cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of glioma. The mechanisms have not been fully understood yet. It is suggested that placenta growth factor (PlGF) is involved in the generation of immune regulatory cells. This study aims to investigate the role of glioma cell-derived PlGF in the generation of regulatory B cells (Breg). Glioma cells were isolated from surgically removed glioma tissue. Cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative real time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Immune suppressor functions of Bregs were assessed by T cell proliferation assay. The results showed that glioma cells expressed PlGF, which was increased after a non-specific activation. Naïve B cells captured the PlGF to differentiate into transforming growth factor-β positive Bregs. The Bregs were activated upon exposure to protein extracts of glioma tissue to suppress the CD8+ T cell proliferation and the release of perforin and granzyme B. We conclude that glioma cell-released PlGF can induce Bregs to suppress CD8+ T cell activities.

Abstract: Inverted polymer-based bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaic (BHJ-OPV) device designs have enabled a breakthrough in operational lifetime through use of stable electrode materials. To date, there have not been systematic performance parameter comparisons between conventional and inverted devices that consider a range of different metal electrodes and presence of native metal oxides at the organic-metal interface. Here, we systematically compute optical and electronic performance parameters for both conventional and inverted BHJ-OPV devices for 15 different electrode types covering a range of workfunctions. We quantitatively demonstrate that (1) high-workfunction metal electrodes (Au, Pd, Ni) are ideal for high-efficiency inverted device performance; and (2) native metal oxide on metal electrodes (e.g., CuO/Cu, Ag2O/Ag, NiO/Ni), which dramatically reduce conventional device efficiencies, can result in highly efficient inverted BHJ-OPV devices (efficiency of up to 6.7% for the P3HT:PCBM system). This work is an important advance over prior studies as it predicts the electrode materials and configurations that can lead to both high efficiency and high stability BHJ-OPV devices.
