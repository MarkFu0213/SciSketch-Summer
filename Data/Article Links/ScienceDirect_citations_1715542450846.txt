Abstract: Summary
Human dendritic cells (DCs) comprise subsets with distinct phenotypic and functional characteristics, but the transcriptional programs that dictate their identity remain elusive. Here, we analyze global chromatin accessibility profiles across resting and stimulated human DC subsets by means of the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). We uncover specific regions of chromatin accessibility for each subset and transcriptional regulators of DC function. By comparing plasmacytoid DC responses to IFN-I-producing and non-IFN-I-producing conditions, we identify genetic programs related to their function. Finally, by intersecting chromatin accessibility with genome-wide association studies, we recognize DC subset-specific enrichment of heritability in autoimmune diseases. Our results unravel the basis of human DC subset heterogeneity and provide a framework for their analysis in disease pathogenesis.

Sphingomyelinase Disables Inactivation in Endogenous PIEZO1 Channels,

Abstract: Summary
Endogenous PIEZO1 channels of native endothelium lack the hallmark inactivation often seen when these channels are overexpressed in cell lines. Because prior work showed that the force of shear stress activates sphingomyelinase in endothelium, we considered if sphingomyelinase is relevant to endogenous PIEZO1. Patch clamping was used to quantify PIEZO1-mediated signals in freshly isolated murine endothelium exposed to the mechanical forces caused by shear stress and membrane stretch. Neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitors and genetic disruption of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3) cause PIEZO1 to switch to profoundly inactivating behavior. Ceramide (a key product of SMPD3) rescues non-inactivating channel behavior. Its co-product, phosphoryl choline, has no effect. In contrast to ceramide, sphingomyelin (the SMPD3 substrate) does not affect inactivation but alters channel force sensitivity. The data suggest that sphingomyelinase activity, ceramide, and sphingomyelin are determinants of native PIEZO gating that enable sustained activity.

Abstract: Summary
Energy-sensing neural circuits decide to expend or conserve resources based, in part, on the tonic, steady-state, energy-store information they receive. Tonic signals, in the form of adipose tissue-derived adipokines, set the baseline level of activity in the energy-sensing neurons, thereby providing context for interpretation of additional inputs. However, the mechanism by which tonic adipokine information establishes steady-state neuronal function has heretofore been unclear. We show here that under conditions of nutrient surplus, Upd2, a Drosophila leptin ortholog, regulates actin-based synapse reorganization to reduce bouton number in an inhibitory circuit, thus establishing a neural tone that is permissive for insulin release. Unexpectedly, we found that insulin feeds back on these same inhibitory neurons to conversely increase bouton number, resulting in maintenance of negative tone. Our results point to a mechanism by which two surplus-sensing hormonal systems, Upd2/leptin and insulin, converge on a neuronal circuit with opposing outcomes to establish energy-store-dependent neuron activity.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-to-cell variability in signal transduction in biological systems is often considered noise. However, intercellular variation (i.e., cell-to-cell variability) has the potential to enable individual cells to encode different information. Here, we show that intercellular variation increases information transmission of skeletal muscle. We analyze the responses of multiple cultured myotubes or isolated skeletal muscle fibers as a multiple-cell channel composed of single-cell channels. We find that the multiple-cell channel, which incorporates intercellular variation as information, not noise, transmitted more information in the presence of intercellular variation than in the absence according to the “response diversity effect,” increasing in the gradualness of dose response by summing the cell-to-cell variable dose responses. We quantify the information transmission of human facial muscle contraction during intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring and find that information transmission of muscle contraction is comparable to that of a multiple-cell channel. Thus, our data indicate that intercellular variation can increase the information capacity of tissues.

Abstract: Summary
The activation, growth, and maturation of oocytes to an ovulatory phase, termed folliculogenesis, is governed by the orchestrated activity of multiple specialized cell types within the ovary; yet, the mechanisms governing diversification and behavior of discrete cellular sub-populations within follicles are poorly understood. We use bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to distinguish the transcriptional signature of prospectively isolated granulosa and theca/stroma cell subsets within human antral follicles derived from xenografts or ovaries. The analysis deconstructs phenotypic diversification within small (<4 mm) antral follicles, identifying secreted factors that are differentially enriched between mural and oophorus granulosa cells, and segregating stromal/support and steroidal activity between theca externa and interna, respectively. Multiple factors are differentially expressed in follicles of xenograft versus ovarian origin. These data capture a high-resolution transcriptional signature of granulosa and theca subpopulations and provide a systems-level portrait of cellular diversification in early antral human follicles.

Abstract: Summary
Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) plays a major role in mitochondrial fusion and in the maintenance of mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites. Given that macrophages play a major role in inflammation, we studied the contribution of Mfn2 to the activity of these cells. Pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced Mfn2 expression. The use of the Mfn2 and Mfn1 myeloid-conditional knockout (KO) mouse models reveals that Mfn2 but not Mfn1 is required for the adaptation of mitochondrial respiration to stress conditions and for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon pro-inflammatory activation. Mfn2 deficiency specifically impairs the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. In addition, the lack of Mfn2 but not Mfn1 is associated with dysfunctional autophagy, apoptosis, phagocytosis, and antigen processing. Mfn2floxed;CreLysM mice fail to be protected from Listeria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or LPS endotoxemia. These results reveal an unexpected contribution of Mfn2 to ROS production and inflammation in macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
The etiology of congenital heart defects (CHDs), which are among the most common human birth defects, is poorly understood because of its complex genetic architecture. Here, we show that two genes implicated in CHDs, Megf8 and Mgrn1, interact genetically and biochemically to regulate the strength of Hedgehog signaling in target cells. MEGF8, a transmembrane protein, and MGRN1, a RING superfamily E3 ligase, assemble to form a receptor-like ubiquitin ligase complex that catalyzes the ubiquitination and degradation of the Hedgehog pathway transducer Smoothened. Homozygous Megf8 and Mgrn1 mutations increased Smoothened abundance and elevated sensitivity to Hedgehog ligands. While mice heterozygous for loss-of-function Megf8 or Mgrn1 mutations were normal, double heterozygous embryos exhibited an incompletely penetrant syndrome of CHDs with heterotaxy. Thus, genetic interactions can arise from biochemical mechanisms that calibrate morphogen signaling strength, a conclusion broadly relevant for the many human diseases in which oligogenic inheritance is emerging as a mechanism for heritability.

Abstract: Summary
ATP11C, a plasma membrane phospholipid flippase, maintains the asymmetric distribution of phosphatidylserine accumulated in the inner leaflet. Caspase-dependent inactivation of ATP11C is essential for an apoptotic “eat me” signal, phosphatidylserine exposure, which prompts phagocytes to engulf cells. We show six cryo-EM structures of ATP11C at 3.0–4.0 Å resolution in five different states of the transport cycle. A structural comparison reveals phosphorylation-driven domain movements coupled with phospholipid binding. Three structures of phospholipid-bound states visualize phospholipid translocation accompanied by the rearrangement of transmembrane helices and an unwound portion at the occlusion site, and thus they detail the basis for head group recognition and the locality of the protein-bound acyl chains in transmembrane grooves. Invariant Lys880 and the surrounding hydrogen-bond network serve as a pivot point for helix bending and precise P domain inclination, which is crucial for dephosphorylation. The structures detail key features of phospholipid translocation by ATP11C, and a common basic mechanism for flippases is emerging.

Abstract: Summary
Motivational states consist of cognitive, emotional, and physiological components controlled by multiple brain regions. An integral component of this neural circuitry is the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Here, we identify that neurons within BNST that express the gene prepronociceptin (PnocBNST) modulate rapid changes in physiological arousal that occur upon exposure to motivationally salient stimuli. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we find that PnocBNST neuronal responses directly correspond with rapid increases in pupillary size when mice are exposed to aversive and rewarding odors. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of these neurons increases pupillary size and anxiety-like behaviors but does not induce approach, avoidance, or locomotion. These findings suggest that excitatory responses in PnocBNST neurons encode rapid arousal responses that modulate anxiety states. Further histological, electrophysiological, and single-cell RNA sequencing data reveal that PnocBNST neurons are composed of genetically and anatomically identifiable subpopulations that may differentially tune rapid arousal responses to motivational stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
Gene and protein expression data provide useful resources for understanding brain function, but little is known about the lipid composition of the brain. Here, we perform quantitative shotgun lipidomics, which enables a cell-type-resolved assessment of the mouse brain lipid composition. We quantify around 700 lipid species and evaluate lipid features including fatty acyl chain length, hydroxylation, and number of acyl chain double bonds, thereby identifying cell-type- and brain-region-specific lipid profiles in adult mice, as well as in aged mice, in apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice, in a model of Alzheimer’s disease, and in mice fed different diets. We also integrate lipid with protein expression profiles to predict lipid pathways enriched in specific cell types, such as fatty acid β-oxidation in astrocytes and sphingolipid metabolism in microglia. This resource complements existing brain atlases of gene and protein expression and may be useful for understanding the role of lipids in brain function.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is immunologically “cold” and predominantly resistant to immune checkpoint therapy due to few tumor-infiltrating T cells. Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy failed to show a significant benefit. Although the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is minimally expressed in prostate tumors, we previously demonstrated that PD-1/PD-L1 expression increases as a compensatory inhibitory pathway in parallel with an ipilimumab-induced increase in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Here, we report the largest trial to date in mCRPC with anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 (nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg; CheckMate 650, NCT02985957). With median follow-ups of 11.9 and 13.5 months in cohorts 1 (pre-chemotherapy; n = 45) and 2 (post-chemotherapy; n = 45), objective response rate was 25% and 10%, and median overall survival was 19.0 and 15.2 months, respectively. Four patients, two in each cohort, had complete responses. Exploratory studies identify potential biomarkers of response. Grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events have occurred in ∼42%–53% of patients, with four treatment-related deaths. Therefore, dose/schedule modifications have been implemented.

Abstract: Summary
Loading of skeletal muscle changes the tissue phenotype reflecting altered metabolic and functional demands. In humans, heterogeneous adaptation to loading complicates the identification of the underpinning molecular regulators. A within-person differential loading and analysis strategy reduces heterogeneity for changes in muscle mass by ∼40% and uses a genome-wide transcriptome method that models each mRNA from coding exons and 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Our strategy detects ∼3–4 times more regulated genes than similarly sized studies, including substantial UTR-selective regulation undetected by other methods. We discover a core of 141 genes correlated to muscle growth, which we validate from newly analyzed independent samples (n = 100). Further validating these identified genes via RNAi in primary muscle cells, we demonstrate that members of the core genes were regulators of protein synthesis. Using proteome-constrained networks and pathway analysis reveals notable relationships with the molecular characteristics of human muscle aging and insulin sensitivity, as well as potential drug therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic gene expression regulation involves thousands of distal regulatory elements. Understanding the quantitative contribution of individual enhancers to gene expression is critical for assessing the role of disease-associated genetic risk variants. Yet, we lack the ability to accurately link genes with their distal regulatory elements. To address this, we used 3D enhancer-promoter (E-P) associations identified using split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE) to build a predictive model of gene expression. Our model dramatically outperforms models using genomic proximity and can be used to determine the quantitative impact of enhancer loss on gene expression in different genetic backgrounds. We show that genes that form stable E-P hubs have less cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. Finally, we identified transcription factors that regulate stimulation-dependent E-P interactions. Together, our results provide a framework for understanding quantitative contributions of E-P interactions and associated genetic variants to gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
The interplay between pancreatic epithelium and the surrounding microenvironment is pivotal for pancreas formation and differentiation as well as adult organ homeostasis. The mesenchyme is the main component of the embryonic pancreatic microenvironment, yet its cellular identity is broadly defined, and whether it comprises functionally distinct cell subsets is not known. Using genetic lineage tracing, transcriptome, and functional studies, we identified mesenchymal populations with different roles during pancreatic development. Moreover, we showed that Pbx transcription factors act within the mouse pancreatic mesenchyme to define a pro-endocrine specialized niche. Pbx directs differentiation of endocrine progenitors into insulin- and glucagon-positive cells through non-cell-autonomous regulation of ECM-integrin interactions and soluble molecules. Next, we measured functional conservation between mouse and human pancreatic mesenchyme by testing identified mesenchymal factors in an iPSC-based differentiation model. Our findings provide insights into how lineage-specific crosstalk between epithelium and neighboring mesenchymal cells underpin the generation of different pancreatic cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) is a major regulator of cardiac functions and is downregulated in the majority of heart failure cases. A key physiological process is the activation of heterotrimeric G-protein Gs by β1-ARs, leading to increased heart rate and contractility. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy and functional studies to investigate the molecular mechanism by which β1-AR activates Gs. We find that the tilting of α5-helix breaks a hydrogen bond between the sidechain of His373 in the C-terminal α5-helix and the backbone carbonyl of Arg38 in the N-terminal αN-helix of Gαs. Together with the disruption of another interacting network involving Gln59 in the α1-helix, Ala352 in the β6-α5 loop, and Thr355 in the α5-helix, these conformational changes might lead to the deformation of the GDP-binding pocket. Our data provide molecular insights into the activation of G-proteins by G-protein-coupled receptors.

Abstract: Summary
SWI/SNF-family remodelers (BAF/PBAF in mammals) are essential chromatin regulators, and mutations in human BAF/PBAF components are associated with ∼20% of cancers. Cancer-associated missense mutations in human BRG1 (encoding the catalytic ATPase) have been characterized previously as conferring loss-of-function. Here, we show that cancer-associated missense mutations in BRG1, when placed into the orthologous Sth1 ATPase of the yeast RSC remodeler, separate into two categories: loss-of-function enzymes, or instead, gain-of-function enzymes that greatly improve DNA translocation efficiency and nucleosome remodeling in vitro. Our work identifies a structural “hub,” formed by the association of several Sth1 domains, that regulates ATPase activity and DNA translocation efficiency. Remarkably, all gain-of-function cancer-associated mutations and all loss-of-function mutations physically localize to distinct adjacent regions in the hub, which specifically regulate and implement DNA translocation, respectively. In vivo, only gain-of-function cancer-associated mutations conferred precocious chromatin accessibility. Taken together, we provide a structure-function mechanistic basis for cancer-associated hyperactivity.

Abstract: Summary
Interactome maps are valuable resources to elucidate protein function and disease mechanisms. Here, we report on an interactome map that focuses on neurodegenerative disease (ND), connects ∼5,000 human proteins via ∼30,000 candidate interactions and is generated by systematic yeast two-hybrid interaction screening of ∼500 ND-related proteins and integration of literature interactions. This network reveals interconnectivity across diseases and links many known ND-causing proteins, such as α-synuclein, TDP-43, and ATXN1, to a host of proteins previously unrelated to NDs. It facilitates the identification of interacting proteins that significantly influence mutant TDP-43 and HTT toxicity in transgenic flies, as well as of ARF-GEP100 that controls misfolding and aggregation of multiple ND-causing proteins in experimental model systems. Furthermore, it enables the prediction of ND-specific subnetworks and the identification of proteins, such as ATXN1 and MKL1, that are abnormally aggregated in postmortem brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients, suggesting widespread protein aggregation in NDs.

Abstract: Summary
The patterns of neuronal connectivity underlying multisensory integration, a fundamental property of many brains, remain poorly characterized. The Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body—an associative center—is an ideal system to investigate how different sensory channels converge in higher order brain centers. The neurons connecting the mushroom body to the olfactory system have been described in great detail, but input from other sensory systems remains poorly defined. Here, we use a range of anatomical and genetic techniques to identify two types of input neuron that connect visual processing centers—the lobula and the posterior lateral protocerebrum—to the dorsal accessory calyx of the mushroom body. Together with previous work that described a pathway conveying visual information from the medulla to the ventral accessory calyx of the mushroom body, our study defines a second, parallel pathway that is anatomically poised to convey information from the visual system to the dorsal accessory calyx.

Abstract: Summary
Cell size control emerges from a regulated balance between the rates of cell growth and division. In bacteria, simple quantitative laws connect cellular growth rate to ribosome abundance. However, it remains poorly understood how translation regulates bacterial cell size and shape under growth perturbations. Here, we develop a whole-cell model for growth dynamics of rod-shaped bacteria that links ribosomal abundance with cell geometry, division control, and the extracellular environment. Our study reveals that cell size maintenance under nutrient perturbations requires a balanced trade-off between ribosomes and division protein synthesis. Deviations from this trade-off relationship are predicted under translation inhibition, leading to distinct modes of cell morphological changes, in agreement with single-cell experimental data on Escherichia coli. Furthermore, by calibrating our model with experimental data, we predict how combinations of nutrient-, translational-, and shape perturbations can be chosen to optimize bacterial growth fitness and antibiotic resistance.

Abstract: Cardiac fibrosis is associated with most of heart diseases, but its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Anoctamin-1 (ANO1), a calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) protein, plays a critical role in various pathophysiological processes. In the current study, we identified ANO1 expression in myocardial infarction (MI) model of rat and verified the role of ANO1 in cardiac fibrosis using transcriptomics combined with RNAi assays. we found that ANO1 expression was increased during the first two weeks, and decreased in the third week after MI. Fluorescence double labeling showed that ANO1 was mainly expressed in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and displayed an increased expression in CFs with proliferation tendency. The proliferation and secretion of CFs were markedly inhibited by knockdown of ANO1. RNA-Seq showed that most of the downregulation genes were related to the proliferation of CFs and cardiac fibrosis. After ANO1 knockdown, the expressions of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and cell nuclear proliferation antigen were markedly reduced, and the phosphorylation levels of MEK and ERK1/2 was decreased significantly, indicating that ANO1 regulate cardiac fibrosis through ATIR-mediated MAPK signaling pathway. These findings would be useful for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting ANO1 to treat and prevent cardiac fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic mutations in skin cancers and other ultraviolet (UV)-exposed cells are typified by C>T and CC>TT substitutions at dipyrimidine sequences; however, many oncogenic “driver” mutations in melanoma do not fit this UV signature. Here, we use genome sequencing to characterize mutations in yeast repeatedly irradiated with UV light. Analysis of ~50,000 UV-induced mutations reveals abundant non-canonical mutations, including T>C, T>A, and AC>TT substitutions. These mutations display transcriptional asymmetry that is modulated by nucleotide excision repair (NER), indicating that they are caused by UV photoproducts. Using a sequencing method called UV DNA endonuclease sequencing (UVDE-seq), we confirm the existence of an atypical thymine-adenine photoproduct likely responsible for UV-induced T>A substitutions. Similar non-canonical mutations are present in skin cancers, which also display transcriptional asymmetry and dependence on NER. These include multiple driver mutations, most prominently the recurrent BRAF V600E and V600K substitutions, suggesting that mutations arising from rare, atypical UV photoproducts may play a role in melanomagenesis.

Abstract: Fractalkine (FKN) and its specific receptor CX3CR1 play a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis including recruitment of vascular cells and the development of inflammation. However, its contribution to regulating the development of atherosclerotic calcification has not been well documented. Osteogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is critical in the development of calcification in atherosclerotic lesions. In this study, for the first time, we evaluated the effect of FKN/CX3CR1 on the progression of VSMCs calcification and defined molecular signaling that is operative in the FKN/CX3CR1-induced osteogenic transformation of VSMCs. We found that high-fat diet induced atherosclerotic calcification in vivo was markedly inhibited in the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and CX3CR1 deficient (ApoE−/−/CX3CR1−/−) mice compared with their control littermates. FKN and CX3CR1 were both expressed in VSMCs and up-regulated by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). FKN/CX3CR1 promoted the expression of osteogenic markers, including osteopontin (OPN), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and decreased VSMCs markers, including smooth muscle (SM) α-actin and SM22-α in a dose-dependent manner. The essential role of FKN/CX3CR1 in VSMCs calcification was further confirmed by lentivirus-mediated knockdown or overexpression of CX3CR1 blocked or accelerated osteogenic transformation of VSMCs. This response was associated with reciprocal up- and down-regulation of osteogenic factor, runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), transcription factors in osteoclast differentiation, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK), RANK ligand (RNAKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), respectively. Inhibition of FKN/CX3CR1-activated Jak2/Stat3 signaling by the Jak/Stat inhibitor AG490 blocked osteogenic transformation of VSMCs and RUNX2 induction concurrently. Taken together, our data uncovered novel roles of FKN/CX3CR1 in promoting VSMC osteogenic transformation and atherosclerotic calcification by activating RUNX2 through Jak2/Stat3 signaling pathway and suppressing OPG. Our findings suggest that targeting FKN/CX3CR1 may provide new strategies for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic calcification.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian organs are nourished by nutrients carried by the blood circulation. These nutrients originate from diet and internal stores, and can undergo various interconversions before their eventual use as tissue fuel. Here we develop isotope tracing, mass spectrometry, and mathematical analysis methods to determine the direct sources of circulating nutrients, their interconversion rates, and eventual tissue-specific contributions to TCA cycle metabolism. Experiments with fifteen nutrient tracers enabled extensive accounting for both circulatory metabolic cycles and tissue TCA inputs, across fed and fasted mice on either high-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet. We find that a majority of circulating carbon flux is carried by two major cycles: glucose-lactate and triglyceride-glycerol-fatty acid. Futile cycling through these pathways is prominent when dietary content of the associated nutrients is low, rendering internal metabolic activity robust to food choice. The presented in vivo flux quantification methods are broadly applicable to different physiological and disease states.

Abstract: Summary
Although ADP-ribosylation of histones by PARP-1 has been linked to genotoxic stress responses, its role in physiological processes and gene expression has remained elusive. We found that NAD+-dependent ADP-ribosylation of histone H2B-Glu35 by small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)-activated PARP-1 inhibits AMP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of adjacent H2B-Ser36, which is required for the proadipogenic gene expression program. The activity of PARP-1 on H2B requires NMNAT-1, a nuclear NAD+ synthase, which directs PARP-1 catalytic activity to Glu and Asp residues. ADP-ribosylation of Glu35 and the subsequent reduction of H2B-Ser36 phosphorylation inhibits the differentiation of adipocyte precursors in cultured cells. Parp1 knockout in preadipocytes in a mouse lineage-tracing genetic model increases adipogenesis, leading to obesity. Collectively, our results demonstrate a functional interplay between H2B-Glu35 ADP-ribosylation and H2B-Ser36 phosphorylation that controls adipogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Primary microRNAs (miRNAs) are the precursors of miRNAs that modulate the expression of most mRNAs in humans. They fold up into a hairpin structure that is cleaved at its base by an enzyme complex known as the Microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8). While many of the molecular details are known, a complete understanding of what features distinguish primary miRNA from hairpin structures in other transcripts is still lacking. We develop a massively parallel functional assay termed Dro-seq (Drosha sequencing) that enables testing of hundreds of known primary miRNA substrates and thousands of single-nucleotide variants. We find an additional feature of primary miRNAs, called Shannon entropy, describing the structural ensemble important for processing. In a deep mutagenesis experiment, we observe particular apical loop U bases, likely recognized by DGCR8, are important for efficient processing. These findings build on existing knowledge about primary miRNA maturation by the Microprocessor and further explore the substrate RNA sequence-structure relationship.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancers are essential drivers of cell states, yet the relationship between accessibility, regulatory activity, and in vivo lineage commitment during embryogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we measure chromatin accessibility in isolated neural and mesodermal lineages across a time course of Drosophila embryogenesis. Promoters, including tissue-specific genes, are often constitutively open, even in contexts where the gene is not expressed. In contrast, the majority of distal elements have dynamic, tissue-specific accessibility. Enhancer priming appears rarely within a lineage, perhaps reflecting the speed of Drosophila embryogenesis. However, many tissue-specific enhancers are accessible in other lineages early on and become progressively closed as embryogenesis proceeds. We demonstrate the usefulness of this tissue- and time-resolved resource to definitively identify single-cell clusters, to uncover predictive motifs, and to identify many regulators of tissue development. For one such predicted neural regulator, l(3)neo38, we generate a loss-of-function mutant and uncover an essential role for neuromuscular junction and brain development.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by extensive fibrosis and hypovascularization, resulting in significant intratumoral hypoxia (low oxygen) that contributes to its aggressiveness, therapeutic resistance, and high mortality. Despite oxygen being a fundamental requirement for many cellular and metabolic processes, and the severity of hypoxia in PDAC, the impact of oxygen deprivation on PDAC biology is poorly understood. Investigating how PDAC cells survive in the near absence of oxygen, we find that PDAC cell lines grow robustly in oxygen tensions down to 0.1%, maintaining mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential, and the oxidative metabolic activity required for the synthesis of key metabolites for proliferation. Disrupting electron transfer efficiency by targeting mitochondrial respiratory supercomplex assembly specifically affects hypoxic PDAC proliferation, metabolism, and in vivo tumor growth. Collectively, our results identify a mechanism that enables PDAC cells to thrive in severe, oxygen-limited microenvironments.

Abstract: Summary
RNA interference (RNAi) is an essential regulatory mechanism in all animals. In Caenorhabditis elegans, several classes of small RNAs act to silence or license expression of mRNA targets. ERI-6/7 is required for the production of some endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and acts as a negative regulator of the exogenous RNAi pathway. We find that the genomic locus encoding eri-6/7 contains two distinct regions that are targeted by endogenous siRNAs. Loss of these siRNAs disrupts eri-6/7 mRNA expression, resulting in increased production of siRNAs from other small RNA pathways because these pathways compete with eri-6/7-dependent transcripts for access to the downstream siRNA amplification machinery. Thus, the pathway acts like a small-RNA-mediated feedback loop to ensure homeostasis of gene expression by small RNA pathways. Similar feedback loops that maintain chromatin homeostasis have been identified in yeast and Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of feedback mechanisms in gene regulatory pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Existing antibiotics are inadequate to defeat tuberculosis (TB), a leading cause of death worldwide. We sought potential targets for host-directed therapies (HDTs) by investigating the host immune response to mycobacterial infection. We used high-throughput CRISPR knockout and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens to identify perturbations that improve the survival of human phagocytic cells infected with Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), as a proxy for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Many of these perturbations constrained the growth of intracellular mycobacteria. We identified over 100 genes associated with diverse biological pathways as potential HDT targets. We validated key components of the type I interferon and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathways that respond to the small-molecule inhibitors cerdulatinib and CH223191, respectively; these inhibitors enhanced human macrophage survival and limited the intracellular growth of Mtb. Thus, high-throughput functional genomic screens, by elucidating highly complex host-pathogen interactions, can serve to identify HDTs to potentially improve TB treatment.

Abstract: Summary
During proteotoxic stress, bacteria maintain critical processes like DNA replication while removing misfolded proteins, which are degraded by the Lon protease. Here, we show that in Caulobacter crescentus Lon controls deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools during stress through degradation of the transcription factor CcrM. Elevated dNTP/nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) ratios in Δlon cells protects them from deletion of otherwise essential deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP)-producing pathways and shields them from hydroxyurea-induced loss of dNTPs. Increased dNTP production in Δlon results from higher expression of ribonucleotide reductase driven by increased CcrM. We show that misfolded proteins can stabilize CcrM by competing for limited protease and that Lon-dependent control of dNTPs improves fitness during protein misfolding conditions. We propose that linking dNTP production with availability of Lon allows Caulobacter to maintain replication capacity when misfolded protein burden increases, such as during rapid growth. Because Lon recognizes misfolded proteins regardless of the stress, this mechanism allows for response to a variety of unanticipated conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The traditional Chinese medicinal herb Notopterygium incisum Ting ex H.T. Chang has anti-rheumatism activity, and a mass spectrometry assay of patients’ serum after administration of the herb revealed that notopterol is the most abundant component enriched. However, the functions of notopterol and its molecular target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment remain unknown. Here, we show in different RA mouse strains that both oral and intraperitoneal administration of notopterol result in significant therapeutic effects. Mechanistically, notopterol directly binds Janus kinase (JAK)2 and JAK3 kinase domains to inhibit JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) activation, leading to reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Critically, combination therapy using both notopterol and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker results in enhanced therapeutic effects compared to using TNF blocker alone. We demonstrate that notopterol ameliorates RA pathology by targeting JAK-STAT signaling, raising the possibility that notopterol could be effective in treating other diseases characterized by aberrant JAK-STAT signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a proteinopathy exhibiting aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) as amyloid plaques and tau as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), whereas primary tauopathies display only a tau pathology. Aβ toxicity is mediated by Fyn kinase in a tau-dependent process; however, whether Fyn controls tau pathology in diseases that lack Aβ pathology remains unexplored. To address this, we generate the Tg/Fyn−/− mouse, which couples mutant tau overexpression with Fyn knockout. Surprisingly, Tg/Fyn−/− mice exhibit a near-complete ablation of NFTs, alongside reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, altered tau solubility, and diminished synaptic tau accumulation. Furthermore, Tg/Fyn−/− brain lysates elicit less tau seeding in tau biosensor cells. Lastly, the fibrillization of tau is boosted by its pseudophosphorylation at the Fyn epitope Y18. Together, this identifies Fyn as a key regulator of tau pathology independently of Aβ-induced toxicity and thereby represents a potentially valuable therapeutic target for not only AD but also tauopathies more generally.

Abstract: Summary
Highly efficient CD8+ T cells are associated with natural HIV control, but it has remained unclear how these cells are generated and maintained. We have used a macaque model of spontaneous SIVmac251 control to monitor the development of efficient CD8+ T cell responses. Our results show that SIV-specific CD8+ T cells emerge during primary infection in all animals. The ability of CD8+ T cells to suppress SIV is suboptimal in the acute phase but increases progressively in controller macaques before the establishment of sustained low-level viremia. Controller macaques develop optimal memory-like SIV-specific CD8+ T cells early after infection. In contrast, a persistently skewed differentiation phenotype characterizes memory SIV-specific CD8+ T cells in non-controller macaques. Accordingly, the phenotype of SIV-specific CD8+ T cells defined early after infection appears to favor the development of protective immunity in controllers, whereas SIV-specific CD8+ T cells in non-controllers fail to gain antiviral potency, feasibly as a consequence of early defects imprinted in the memory pool.

Abstract: Summary
The linkage, length, and architecture of ubiquitin (Ub) chains are all important variables in providing tight control over many biological paradigms. There are clear roles for branched architectures in regulating proteasome-mediated degradation, but the proteins that selectively recognize and process these atypical chains are unknown. Here, using synthetic and enzyme-derived ubiquitin chains along with intact mass spectrometry, we report that UCH37/UCHL5, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinase, cleaves K48 branched chains. The activity and selectivity toward branched chains is markedly enhanced by the proteasomal Ub receptor RPN13/ADRM1. Using reconstituted proteasome complexes, we find that chain debranching promotes degradation of substrates modified with branched chains under multi-turnover conditions. These results are further supported by proteome-wide pulse-chase experiments, which show that the loss of UCH37 activity impairs global protein turnover. Our work therefore defines UCH37 as a debranching deubiquitinase important for promoting proteasomal degradation.

Abstract: Summary
The canonical mammalian Hippo pathway contains a core kinase signaling cascade requiring upstream MST to form a stable complex with SAV1 in order to phosphorylate the downstream LATS/MOB complex. Though SAV1 dimerization is essential for the trans-activation of MST, the molecular mechanism underlying SAV1 dimerization is unclear. Here, we discover that the SAV1 WW tandem containing a short Pro-rich extension immediately following the WW tandem (termed as “WW12ex”) forms a highly stable homodimer. The crystal structure of SAV1 WW12ex reveals that the Pro-rich extension of one subunit binds to both WW domains from the other subunit. Thus, SAV1 WW12ex forms a domain-swapped dimer instead of a WW2 homodimerization-mediated dimer. The WW12ex-mediated dimerization of SAV1 is required for the MST/SAV1 complex assembly and MST kinase activation. Finally, we show that several cancer-related SAV1 variants disrupt SAV1 dimer formation, and thus, these mutations may impair the tumor-suppression activity of SAV1.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms resulting in abdominal pain include altered neuro-immune interactions in the gastrointestinal tract, but the signaling processes that link immune activation with visceral hypersensitivity are unresolved. We hypothesized that enteric glia link the neural and immune systems of the gut and that communication between enteric glia and immune cells modulates the development of visceral hypersensitivity. To this end, we manipulated a major mechanism of glial intercellular communication that requires connexin-43 and assessed the effects on acute and chronic inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, and immune responses. Deleting connexin-43 in glia protected against the development of visceral hypersensitivity following chronic colitis. Mechanistically, the protective effects of glial manipulation were mediated by disrupting the glial-mediated activation of macrophages through the macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Collectively, our data identified enteric glia as a critical link between gastrointestinal neural and immune systems that could be harnessed by therapies to ameliorate abdominal pain.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the basal forebrain (BF) has been associated with increased attention, arousal, and a heightened cortical representation of the external world. In addition, BF has been implicated in the regulation of the default mode network (DMN) and associated behaviors. Here, we provide causal evidence for a role of BF in DMN regulation, highlighting a prominent role of parvalbumin (PV) GABAergic neurons. The optogenetic activation of BF PV neurons reliably drives animals toward DMN-like behaviors, with no effect on memory encoding. In contrast, BF electrical stimulation enhances memory performance and increases DMN-like behaviors. BF stimulation has a correlated impact on peptide regulation in the BF and ACC, enhancing peptides linked to grooming behavior and memory functions, supporting a crucial role of the BF in DMN regulation. We suggest that in addition to enhancing attentional functions, the BF harbors a network encompassing PV GABAergic neurons that promotes self-directed behaviors associated with the DMN.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear actin has been elusive due to the lack of knowledge about molecular mechanisms. From actin-containing chromatin remodeling complexes, we discovered an arginine mono-methylation mark on an evolutionarily conserved R256 residue of actin (R256me1). Actin R256 mutations in yeast affect nuclear functions and cause diseases in human. Interestingly, we show that an antibody specific for actin R256me1 preferentially stains nuclear actin over cytoplasmic actin in yeast, mouse, and human cells. We also show that actin R256me1 is regulated by protein arginine methyl transferase-5 (PRMT5) in HEK293 cells. A genome-wide survey of actin R256me1 mark provides a landscape for nuclear actin correlated with transcription. Further, gene expression and protein interaction studies uncover extensive correlations between actin R256me1 and active transcription. The discovery of actin R256me1 mark suggests a fundamental mechanism to distinguish nuclear actin from cytoplasmic actin through post-translational modification (PTM) and potentially implicates an actin PTM mark in transcription and human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) promotes cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling. Using an in vivo protein kinase A activity sensor (PKA-SPARK), we find that Drosophila FMRP (dFMRP) and human FMRP (hFMRP) enhance PKA activity in a central brain learning and memory center. Increasing neuronal PKA activity suppresses FMRP in Kenyon cells, demonstrating an FMRP-PKA negative feedback loop. A patient-derived R140Q FMRP point mutation mislocalizes PKA-SPARK activity, whereas deletion of the RNA-binding arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) box (hFMRP-ΔRGG) produces fibrillar PKA-SPARK assemblies colocalizing with ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and aggregation (thioflavin T) markers, demonstrating fibrillar partitioning of cytosolic protein aggregates. hFMRP-ΔRGG reduces dFMRP levels, indicating RGG-independent regulation. Short-term hFMRP-ΔRGG induction produces activated PKA-SPARK puncta, whereas long induction drives fibrillar assembly. Elevated temperature disassociates hFMRP-ΔRGG aggregates and blocks activated PKA-SPARK localization. These results suggest that FMRP regulates compartmentalized signaling via complex assembly, directing PKA activity localization, with FMRP RGG box RNA binding restricting separation via low-complexity interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy eliminates cytoplasmic content selected by autophagy receptors, which link cargo to the membrane-bound autophagosomal ubiquitin-like protein Atg8/LC3. Here, we report a selective autophagy pathway for protein condensates formed by endocytic proteins in yeast. In this pathway, the endocytic protein Ede1 functions as a selective autophagy receptor. Distinct domains within Ede1 bind Atg8 and mediate phase separation into condensates. Both properties are necessary for an Ede1-dependent autophagy pathway for endocytic proteins, which differs from regular endocytosis and does not involve other known selective autophagy receptors but requires the core autophagy machinery. Cryo-electron tomography of Ede1-containing condensates, at the plasma membrane and in autophagic bodies, shows a phase-separated compartment at the beginning and end of the Ede1-mediated selective autophagy route. Our data suggest a model for autophagic degradation of macromolecular protein complexes by the action of intrinsic autophagy receptors.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV fusion peptide (FP) is a promising vaccine target. FP-directed monoclonal antibodies from vaccinated macaques have been identified that neutralize up to ∼60% of HIV strains; these vaccinations, however, have involved ∼1 year with an extended neutralization-eclipse phase without measurable serum neutralization. Here, in 32 macaques, we test seven vaccination regimens, each comprising multiple immunizations of FP-carrier conjugates and HIV envelope (Env) trimers. Comparisons of vaccine regimens reveal FP-carrier conjugates to imprint cross-clade neutralizing responses and a cocktail of FP conjugate and Env trimer to elicit the earliest broad responses. We identify a signature, appearing as early as week 6 and involving the frequency of B cells recognizing both FP and Env trimer, predictive of vaccine-elicited breadth ∼1 year later. Immune monitoring of B cells in response to vaccination can thus enable vaccine insights even in the absence of serum neutralization, here identifying FP imprinting, cocktail approach, and early signature as means to improve FP-directed vaccine responses.

Abstract: Summary
Human spliceosomes contain numerous proteins absent in yeast, whose functions remain largely unknown. Here we report a 3D cryo-EM structure of the human spliceosomal C complex at 3.4 Å core resolution and 4.5–5.7 Å at its periphery, and aided by protein crosslinking we determine its molecular architecture. Our structure provides additional insights into the spliceosome’s architecture between the catalytic steps of splicing, and how proteins aid formation of the spliceosome’s catalytically active RNP (ribonucleoprotein) conformation. It reveals the spatial organization of the metazoan-specific proteins PPWD1, WDR70, FRG1, and CIR1 in human C complexes, indicating they stabilize functionally important protein domains and RNA structures rearranged/repositioned during the Bact to C transition. Structural comparisons with human Bact, C∗, and P complexes reveal an intricate cascade of RNP rearrangements during splicing catalysis, with intermediate RNP conformations not found in yeast, and additionally elucidate the structural basis for the sequential recruitment of metazoan-specific spliceosomal proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to remodel lipid metabolism under changing conditions is pivotal for cellular functionality and homeostasis. Here, we characterize the regulatory landscape of phosphorylation-based signaling events across the life cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determine its impact on the regulation of lipid metabolism. Our data show that 50 lipid metabolic proteins are differentially phosphorylated as cells transit between different physiological states. To identify functional phosphosites, we devised a strategy where multiple phosphosites are simultaneously mutated into phosphomimetic or phosphodeficient alleles and mutants are phenotyped by in-depth lipidomics flux analysis. This uncovers functional phosphosites in the phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase Cds1, the phosphatidylserine synthase Cho1, and Fas2, the α-subunit of the fatty acid synthase (FAS) complex. Furthermore, we show that the fatty acyl chain length produced by FAS is governed by phosphorylation. Overall, our work demonstrates a vital role for phosphoregulation of lipid metabolism and provides a resource to investigate its molecular underpinnings.

Abstract: Summary
Voluntary running enhances adult hippocampal neurogenesis, with consequences for hippocampal-dependent learning ability and mood regulation. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that voluntary running induces unique and dynamic gene expression changes specifically within the adult-born hippocampal neurons, with significant impact on genes involved in neuronal maturation and human diseases. We identify the regulator of G protein signaling 6 (RGS6) as a key factor that mediates running impact on adult-born neurons. RGS6 overexpression mimics the positive effects of voluntary running on morphological and physiological maturation of adult new neurons and reduced sensitivity of adult-born neurons to the inhibitory effect of GABAB (γ-Aminobutyric acid B) receptor activation. Knocking down RGS6 abolishes running-enhanced neuronal maturation and hippocampal neurogenesis-dependent learning and anxiolytic effect. Our study provides a data resource showing genome-wide intrinsic molecular changes in adult-born hippocampal neurons that contribute to voluntary running-induced neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell gene expression is inherently variable, but how this variability is controlled in response to stimulation remains unclear. Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq and single-molecule mRNA counting (smFISH) to study inducible gene expression in the immune toll-like receptor system. We show that mRNA counts of tumor necrosis factor α conform to a standard stochastic switch model, while transcription of interleukin-1β involves an additional regulatory step resulting in increased heterogeneity. Despite different modes of regulation, systematic analysis of single-cell data for a range of genes demonstrates that the variability in transcript count is linearly constrained by the mean response over a range of conditions. Mathematical modeling of smFISH counts and experimental perturbation of chromatin state demonstrates that linear constraints emerge through modulation of transcriptional bursting along with gene-specific relationships. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that the variability of the inducible single-cell mRNA response is constrained by transcriptional bursting.

Abstract: Summary
The innate immune system responds to infections that give rise to pain. How the innate immune system interacts with the sensory nervous system and contributes to pain is poorly understood. Here we report that hyperactivity of innate immunity primes and initiates pain states via the TLR2-interleukin-33 (IL-33) axis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are upregulated in the complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) pain model, and knockout of TLR2 abolishes CFA-induced pain. Selective activation of TLR2/6 triggers acute pain via upregulation of IL-33 in the hindpaw, dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and spinal cord in an NLRP3-dependent manner. The IL-33 increase further initiates priming of nociceptive neurons and pain states. Finally, blocking IL-33 receptors at the spinal level mediates analgesia during acute and chronic inflammatory pain, underscoring an important function of IL-33 in pain signaling. Collectively, our data reveal a critical role of the TLR2-IL-33 axis in innate immune activation for pain initiation and maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a post-translational modification that plays pivotal roles in a wide range of cellular processes. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of ADPr under physiological conditions, without relying on genetic or chemical perturbation, has been hindered by technical limitations. Here, we describe the applicability of activated ion electron transfer dissociation (AI-ETD) for MS-based proteomics analysis of physiological ADPr using our unbiased Af1521 enrichment strategy. To benchmark AI-ETD, we profile 9,000 ADPr peptides mapping to >5,000 unique ADPr sites from a limited number of cells exposed to oxidative stress and identify 120% and 28% more ADPr peptides compared to contemporary strategies using ETD and electron-transfer higher-energy collisional dissociation (EThcD), respectively. Under physiological conditions, AI-ETD identifies 450 ADPr sites on low-abundant proteins, including in vivo cysteine modifications on poly(ADP-ribosyl)polymerase (PARP) 8 and tyrosine modifications on PARP14, hinting at specialist enzymatic functions for these enzymes. Collectively, our data provide insights into the physiological regulation of ADPr.

Abstract: Summary
The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila uses many effector proteins delivered by the bacterial type IV secretion system (T4SS) to hijack the early secretory pathway to establish its replicative niche, known as the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). On LCV biogenesis, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vesicular soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (v-SNARE) Sec22b is recruited to the bacterial phagosome and forms non-canonical pairings with target membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs) from the plasma membrane. Here, we identify a Legionella deubiquitinase (DUB), LotB, that can modulate the early secretory pathway by interacting with coatomer protein complex I (COPI) vesicles when ectopically expressed. We show that Sec22b is ubiquitinated upon L. pneumophila infection in a T4SS-dependent manner and that, subsequently, LotB deconjugates K63-linked ubiquitins from Sec22b. The DUB activity of LotB stimulates dissociation of the t-SNARE syntaxin 3 (Stx3) from Sec22b, which resides on the LCV. Our study highlights a bacterial strategy manipulating the dynamics of infection-induced SNARE pairing using a bacterial DUB.

Abstract: The construction of a low affinity Ca2+-probe that locates to the cell cortex and cell surface wrinkles, is described called. EPIC3 (ezrin-protein indicator of Ca2+). The novel probe is a fusion of CEPIA3 with ezrin, and is used in combination with a Ca2+-insensitive probe, ezrin-mCherry, both of which locate at the cell cortex. EPIC3 was used to monitor the effect of Ca2+ influx on intra-wrinkle Ca2+ in the macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. During experimentally–induced Ca2+influx, EPIC3 reported Ca2+ concentrations at the cell cortex in the region of 30−50 μM, with peak locations towards the tips of wrinkles reaching 80 μM. These concentrations were associated with cleavage of ezrin (a substrate for the Ca2+ activated protease calpain-1) and released the C-terminal fluors. The cortical Ca2+ levels, restricted to near the site of phagocytic cup formation and pseudopodia extension during phagocytosis also reached high levels (50−80 μM) during phagocytosis. As phagocytosis was completed, hotspots of Ca2+ near the phagosome were also observed.

Abstract: Introduction
Bladder dysfunction has been considered as one of the most critical health conditions with no proper treatment. Current therapeutic approaches including enterocystoplasty have several limitations. Hence, biofabrication of cell-laden biological allografts using decellularized Goat urinary bladder scaffolds for organ reconstruction/regeneration was major objective of this study.
Materials and methods
An efficient method for decellularization of Goat urinary bladder (N = 3) was developed by perfusion of gradient change of detergents through ureter. The retention of organ architecture, extracellular matrix composition, mechanical properties and removal of cellular components was characterized using histological, cellular and molecular analysis. Further, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human umbilical cord blood (UCB) were used for preparing biological construct of decellularized urinary bladder (DUB) scaffolds to augment the urinary bladder reconstruction/regeneration.
Results
The decellularization method adopted in this study generated completely DUB scaffolds within 10 h at 100 mm Hg pressure and constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. The DUB scaffold retains organ architecture, ECM composition, and mechanical strength. No significant amount of residual nucleic acid was observed post-decellularization. Furthermore, MSCs derived from human UCB engrafted and proliferated well on DUB scaffolds in highly aligned manner under xeno-free condition.
Conclusion
Biofabricated humanized urinary bladder constructs provides xeno-free allografts for future application in augmenting urinary bladder reconstruction/regeneration with further development.

Abstract: Summary
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most useful non-invasive diagnostic tests for a wide array of cardiac disorders. Traditional approaches to analyzing ECGs focus on individual segments. Here, we performed comprehensive deep phenotyping of 77,190 ECGs in the UK Biobank across the complete cycle of cardiac conduction, resulting in 500 spatial-temporal datapoints, across 10 million genetic variants. In addition to characterizing polygenic risk scores for the traditional ECG segments, we identified over 300 genetic loci that are statistically associated with the high-dimensional representation of the ECG. We established the genetic ECG signature for dilated cardiomyopathy, associated the BAG3, HSPB7/CLCNKA, PRKCA, TMEM43, and OBSCN loci with disease risk and confirmed this association in an independent cohort. In total, our work demonstrates that a high-dimensional analysis of the entire ECG provides unique opportunities for studying cardiac biology and disease and furthering drug development. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Translation of ribosomal protein-coding mRNAs (RP-mRNAs) constitutes a key step in ribosome biogenesis, but the mechanisms that modulate RP-mRNA translation in coordination with other cellular processes are poorly defined. Here, we show that subcellular localization of RP-mRNAs acts as a key regulator of their translation during cell migration. As cells migrate into their surroundings, RP-mRNAs localize to the actin-rich cell protrusions. This localization is mediated by La-related protein 6 (LARP6), an RNA-binding protein that is enriched in protrusions. Protrusions act as hotspots of translation for RP-mRNAs, enhancing RP synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, and the overall protein synthesis in migratory cells. In human breast carcinomas, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) upregulates LARP6 expression to enhance protein synthesis and support invasive growth. Our findings reveal LARP6-mediated mRNA localization as a key regulator of ribosome biogenesis during cell migration and demonstrate a role for this process in cancer progression downstream of EMT.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic transformation alters lipid metabolism to sustain tumor growth. We define a mechanism by which cholesterol metabolism controls the development and differentiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Disruption of distal cholesterol biosynthesis by conditional inactivation of the rate-limiting enzyme Nsdhl or treatment with cholesterol-lowering statins switches glandular pancreatic carcinomas to a basal (mesenchymal) phenotype in mouse models driven by KrasG12D expression and homozygous Trp53 loss. Consistently, PDACs in patients receiving statins show enhanced mesenchymal features. Mechanistically, statins and NSDHL loss induce SREBP1 activation, which promotes the expression of Tgfb1, enabling epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Evidence from patient samples in this study suggests that activation of transforming growth factor β signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by cholesterol-lowering statins may promote the basal type of PDAC, conferring poor outcomes in patients.

Abstract: Summary
We integrate the genomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics of 480 clinical tissues from 146 patients in a Chinese colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort, among which 70 had metastatic CRC (mCRC). Proteomic profiling differentiates three CRC subtypes characterized by distinct clinical prognosis and molecular signatures. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling of primary tumors alone successfully distinguishes cases with metastasis. Metastatic tissues exhibit high similarities with primary tumors at the genetic but not the proteomic level, and kinase network analysis reveals significant heterogeneity between primary colorectal tumors and their liver metastases. In vivo xenograft-based drug tests using 31 primary and metastatic tumors show personalized responses, which could also be predicted by kinase-substrate network analysis no matter whether tumors carry mutations in the drug-targeted genes. Our study provides a valuable resource for better understanding of mCRC and has potential for clinical application.

Abstract: Summary
MYO18B loss-of-function mutations and depletion significantly compromise the structural integrity of striated muscle sarcomeres. The molecular function of the encoded protein, myosin-18B (M18B), within the developing muscle is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that recombinant M18B lacks motor ATPase activity and harbors previously uncharacterized N-terminal actin-binding domains, properties that make M18B an efficient actin cross-linker and molecular brake capable of regulating muscle myosin-2 contractile forces. Spatiotemporal analysis of M18B throughout cardiomyogenesis and myofibrillogenesis reveals that this structural myosin undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic redistribution during myogenic differentiation, where its incorporation within muscle stress fibers coincides with actin striation onset. Furthermore, this analysis shows that M18B is directly integrated within the muscle myosin thick filament during myofibril maturation. Altogether, our data suggest that M18B has evolved specific biochemical properties that allow it to define and maintain sarcomeric organization from within the thick filament via its dual actin cross-linking and motor modulating capabilities.

Abstract: Summary
Immune cells in the mucosal barriers of vertebrates are highly heterogeneous in their origin and function. This heterogeneity is further exemplified by the recent discovery of ectoderm-derived immune cells—metaphocytes in zebrafish epidermis. Yet, whether non-hematopoiesis-derived immune cells generally exist in barrier tissues remains obscured. Here, we report the identification and characterization of an endoderm-derived immune cell population in the gill and intestine of zebrafish. Transcriptome analysis reveals that the endoderm-derived immune cells are myeloid-like cells with high similarities to the ectoderm-derived metaphocytes in epidermis. Like metaphocytes in epidermis, the endoderm-derived immune cells are non-phagocytic but professional in external soluble antigen uptake. Depletion of the endoderm-derived immune cells in gill hinder the local immune response to external soluble stimulants. This study demonstrates a general existence of non-hematopoiesis-derived immune cells in zebrafish mucosal barriers and challenges the prevalent view that resident immune cells in mucosal barriers arise exclusively from hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Deep space exploration will require real-time, minimally invasive monitoring of astronaut health to mitigate the potential health impairments caused by space radiation and microgravity. Genotoxic stress in humans can be monitored by quantifying the amount of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immune cells from a simple finger prick. In a cohort of 674 healthy donors, we show that the endogenous level of DSBs increases with age and with latent cytomegalovirus infection. To map the range of human responses to space radiation, we then study DSB induction and repair in immune cells from 319 healthy donors after the cells are exposed to galactic cosmic ray components and lymphocytes from 30 cancer patients after radiotherapy. Individuals with low baseline DSB have fewer clinical complications, enhanced DNA damage repair responses, and a functional dose-dependent cytokine response in healthy donor cells. This supports the use of DSB monitoring for health resilience in space.

Abstract: Summary
To determine whether double-strand break (DSB) mobility enhances the physical search for an ectopic template during homology-directed repair (HDR), we tested the effects of factors that control chromatin dynamics, including cohesin loading and kinetochore anchoring. The former but not the latter is altered in response to DSBs. Loss of the nonhistone high-mobility group protein Nhp6 reduces histone occupancy and increases chromatin movement, decompaction, and ectopic HDR. The loss of nucleosome remodeler INO80-C did the opposite. To see whether enhanced HDR depends on DSB mobility or the global chromatin response, we tested the ubiquitin ligase mutant uls1Δ, which selectively impairs local but not global movement in response to a DSB. Strand invasion occurs in uls1Δ cells with wild-type kinetics, arguing that global histone depletion rather than DSB movement is rate limiting for HDR. Impaired break movement in uls1Δ correlates with elevated MRX and cohesin loading, despite normal resection and checkpoint activation.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo signaling pathway maintains organ size and tissue homeostasis via orchestration of cell proliferation and apoptosis. How this pathway triggers cell apoptosis remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify NR4A1 as a target of the Hippo pathway that mediates the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor effects of the Hippo pathway whereby YAP regulates the transcription, phosphorylation, and mitochondrial localization of NR4A1. NR4A1, in turn, functions as a feedback inhibitor of YAP to promote its degradation, thereby inhibiting the function of YAP during liver regeneration and tumorigenesis. Our studies elucidate a regulatory loop between NR4A1 and YAP to coordinate Hippo signaling activity during liver regeneration and tumorigenesis and highlight NR4A1 as a marker of Hippo signaling, as well as a therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: Summary
53BP1 plays a central role in dictating DNA repair choice between non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), which is important for the sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) of BRCA1-deficient cancers. In this study, we show that FOXK1 associates with 53BP1 and regulates 53BP1-dependent functions. FOXK1-53BP1 interaction is significantly enhanced upon DNA damage during the S phase in an ATM/CHK2-dependent manner, which reduces the association of 53BP1 with its downstream factors RIF1 and PTIP. Depletion of FOXK1 impairs DNA repair and induces compromised cell survival upon DNA damage. Overexpression of FOXK1 diminishes 53BP1 foci formation, which leads to resistance to PARPis and elevation of HR in BRCA1-deficient cells and decreased telomere fusion in TRF2-depleted cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that FOXK1 negatively regulates 53BP1 function by inhibiting 53BP1 localization to sites of DNA damage, which alters the DSB-induced protein complexes centering on 53BP1 and thus influences DNA repair choice.

Abstract: Summary
Locus control region (LCR) functions define cellular identity and have critical roles in diseases such as cancer, although the hierarchy of structural components and associated factors that drive functionality are incompletely understood. Here we show that OCA-B, a B cell-specific coactivator essential for germinal center (GC) formation, forms a ternary complex with the lymphoid-enriched OCT2 and GC-specific MEF2B transcription factors and that this complex occupies and activates an LCR that regulates the BCL6 proto-oncogene and is uniquely required by normal and malignant GC B cells. Mechanistically, through OCA-B-MED1 interactions, this complex is required for Mediator association with the BCL6 promoter. Densely tiled CRISPRi screening indicates that only LCR segments heavily bound by this ternary complex are essential for its function. Our results demonstrate how an intimately linked complex of lineage- and stage-specific factors converges on specific and highly essential enhancer elements to drive the function of a cell-type-defining LCR.

Abstract: Summary
Stabilization of stalled replication forks is a prominent mechanism of PARP (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase) inhibitor (PARPi) resistance in BRCA-deficient tumors. Epigenetic mechanisms of replication fork stability are emerging but remain poorly understood. Here, we report the histone acetyltransferase PCAF (p300/CBP-associated) as a fork-associated protein that promotes fork degradation in BRCA-deficient cells by acetylating H4K8 at stalled replication forks, which recruits MRE11 and EXO1. A H4K8ac binding domain within MRE11/EXO1 is required for their recruitment to stalled forks. Low PCAF levels, which we identify in a subset of BRCA2-deficient tumors, stabilize stalled forks, resulting in PARPi resistance in BRCA-deficient cells. Furthermore, PCAF activity is tightly regulated by ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related), which phosphorylates PCAF on serine 264 (S264) to limit its association and activity at stalled forks. Our results reveal PCAF and histone acetylation as critical regulators of fork stability and PARPi responses in BRCA-deficient cells, which provides key insights into targeting BRCA-deficient tumors and identifying epigenetic modulators of chemotherapeutic responses.

Abstract: Summary
The marginal zone (MZ) contributes to the highly organized spleen microarchitecture. We show that expression of atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) defines two equal-sized populations of mouse MZ B cells (MZBs). ACKR3 is required for development of a functional MZ and for positioning of MZBs. Deletion of ACKR3 on B cells distorts the MZ, and MZBs fail to deliver antigens to follicles, reducing humoral responses. Reconstitution of MZ-deficient CD19ko mice shows that ACKR3− MZBs can differentiate into ACKR3+ MZBs, but not vice versa. The lack of a MZ is rescued by adoptive transfer of ACKR3-sufficient, and less by ACKR3-deficient, follicular B cells (FoBs); hence, ACKR3 expression is crucial for establishment of the MZ. The inability of CD19ko mice to respond to T-independent antigen is rescued when ACKR3-proficient, but not ACKR3-deficient, FoBs are transferred. Accordingly, ACKR3-deficient FoBs are able to reconstitute the MZ if the niche is pre-established by ACKR3-proficient MZBs.

Abstract: Summary
Tegmental nuclei in the ventral midbrain and anterior hindbrain control motivated behavior, mood, memory, and movement. These nuclei contain inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic neurons, whose molecular diversity and development remain largely unraveled. Many tegmental neurons originate in the embryonic ventral rhombomere 1 (r1), where GABAergic fate is regulated by the transcription factor (TF) Tal1. We used single-cell mRNA sequencing of the mouse ventral r1 to characterize the Tal1-dependent and independent neuronal precursors. We describe gene expression dynamics during bifurcation of the GABAergic and glutamatergic lineages and show how active Notch signaling promotes GABAergic fate selection in post-mitotic precursors. We identify GABAergic precursor subtypes that give rise to distinct tegmental nuclei and demonstrate that Sox14 and Zfpm2, two TFs downstream of Tal1, are necessary for the differentiation of specific tegmental GABAergic neurons. Our results provide a framework for understanding the development of cellular diversity in the tegmental nuclei.

Abstract: Summary
Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is an important human pathogen associated with gastric inflammation and neoplasia. It is commonly believed that this bacterium avoids major immune recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) because of low intrinsic activity of its flagellin and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In particular, TLR5 specifically detects flagellins in various bacterial pathogens, while Hp evolved mutations in flagellin to evade detection through TLR5. Cancerogenic Hp strains encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The T4SS core component and pilus-associated protein CagY, a large VirB10 ortholog, drives effector molecule translocation. Here, we identify CagY as a flagellin-independent TLR5 agonist. We detect five TLR5 interaction sites, promoting binding of CagY-positive Hp to TLR5-expressing cells, TLR5 stimulation, and intracellular signal transduction. Consequently, CagY constitutes a remarkable VirB10 member detected by TLR5, driving crucial innate immune responses by this human pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
DNA crosslinking agents are commonly used in cancer chemotherapy; however, responses of normal tissues to these agents have not been widely investigated. We reveal in mouse interfollicular epidermal, mammary and hair follicle epithelia that genotoxicity does not promote apoptosis but paradoxically induces hyperplasia and fate specification defects in quiescent stem cells. DNA damage to skin causes epithelial and dermal hyperplasia, tissue expansion, and proliferation-independent formation of abnormal K14/K10 dual-positive suprabasal cells. Unexpectedly, this behavior is epithelial cell non-autonomous and independent of an intact immune system. Instead, dermal fibroblasts are both necessary and sufficient to induce the epithelial response, which is mediated by activation of a fibroblast-specific NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent IL-1β production. Thus, genotoxic agents that are used chemotherapeutically to promote cancer cell death can have the opposite effect on wild-type epithelia by inducing, via a non-autonomous IL-1β-driven mechanism, both hyperplasia and stem cell lineage defects.

Abstract: Summary
Plasma cells secreting affinity-matured antibodies develop in germinal centers (GCs), where B cells migrate persistently and directionally over defined periods of time. How modes of GC B cell migration influence plasma cell development remained unclear. Through genetic deletion of the F-actin bundling protein Swiprosin-1/EF-hand domain family member 2 (EFhd2) and by two-photon microscopy, we show that EFhd2 restrains B cell speed in GCs and hapten-specific plasma cell output. Modeling the GC reaction reveals that increasing GC B cell speed promotes plasma cell generation. Lack of EFhd2 also reduces contacts of GC B cells with follicular dendritic cells in vivo. Computational modeling uncovers that both GC output and antibody affinity depend quantitatively on contacts of GC B cells with follicular dendritic cells when B cells migrate more persistently. Collectively, our data explain how GC B cells integrate speed and persistence of cell migration with B cell receptor affinity.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the structure and function of neural circuits underlying speech and language is a vital step toward better treatments for diseases of these systems. Songbirds, among the few animal orders that share with humans the ability to learn vocalizations from a conspecific, have provided many insights into the neural mechanisms of vocal development. However, research into vocal learning circuits has been hindered by a lack of tools for rapid genetic targeting of specific neuron populations to meet the quick pace of developmental learning. Here, we present a viral tool that enables fast and efficient retrograde access to projection neuron populations. In zebra finches, Bengalese finches, canaries, and mice, we demonstrate fast retrograde labeling of cortical or dopaminergic neurons. We further demonstrate the suitability of our construct for detailed morphological analysis, for in vivo imaging of calcium activity, and for multi-color brainbow labeling.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are shed from solid cancers in the form of single or clustered cells, and the latter display an extraordinary ability to initiate metastasis. Yet, the biological phenomena that trigger the shedding of CTC clusters from a primary cancerous lesion are poorly understood. Here, when dynamically labeling breast cancer cells along cancer progression, we observe that the majority of CTC clusters are undergoing hypoxia, while single CTCs are largely normoxic. Strikingly, we find that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting leads to primary tumor shrinkage, but it increases intra-tumor hypoxia, resulting in a higher CTC cluster shedding rate and metastasis formation. Conversely, pro-angiogenic treatment increases primary tumor size, yet it dramatically suppresses the formation of CTC clusters and metastasis. Thus, intra-tumor hypoxia leads to the formation of clustered CTCs with high metastatic ability, and a pro-angiogenic therapy suppresses metastasis formation through prevention of CTC cluster generation.

Abstract: Dendrites require precise and timely delivery of protein substrates to distal areas to ensure the correct morphology and function of neurons. Many of these protein substrates are supplied in the form of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex consisting of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and mRNAs, which are subsequently translated in distal dendritic areas. It remains elusive, however, whether key RBPs supply mRNA according to local demands individually or in a coordinated manner. In this study, we investigated how Drosophila sensory neurons respond to the dysregulation of a disease-associated RBP, Ataxin-2 (ATX2), which leads to dendritic defects. We found that ATX2 plays a crucial role in spacing dendritic branches for the optimal dendritic receptive fields in Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons, where both expression level and subcellular location of ATX2 contribute significantly to this effect. We showed that translational upregulation through the expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) further enhanced the ATX2-induced dendritic phenotypes. Additionally, we found that the expression level of another disease-associated RBP, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), decreased in both cell bodies and dendrites when neurons were faced with aberrant upregulation of ATX2. Finally, we revealed that the PAM2 motif of ATX2, which mediates its interaction with poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), is potentially necessary for the decrease of FMRP in certain neuronal stress conditions. Collectively, our data suggest that dysregulation of RBPs triggers a compensatory regulation of other functionally-overlapping RBPs to minimize RBP dysregulation-associated aberrations that hinder neuronal homeostasis in dendrites.

Abstract: Summary
Cell senescence plays a key role in age-associated organ dysfunction, but the in vivo pathogenesis is largely unclear. Here, we generated a p16-CreERT2-tdTomato mouse model to analyze the in vivo characteristics of p16high cells at a single-cell level. We found tdTomato-positive p16high cells detectable in all organs, which were enriched with age. We also found that these cells failed to proliferate and had half-lives ranging from 2.6 to 4.2 months, depending on the tissue examined. Single-cell transcriptomics in the liver and kidneys revealed that p16high cells were present in various cell types, though most dominant in hepatic endothelium and in renal proximal and distal tubule epithelia, and that these cells exhibited heterogeneous senescence-associated phenotypes. Further, elimination of p16high cells ameliorated nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related hepatic lipidosis and immune cell infiltration. Our new mouse model and single-cell analysis provide a powerful resource to enable the discovery of previously unidentified senescence functions in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the noisy nature of single cells, multicellular organisms robustly generate different cell types from one zygote. This process involves dynamic cross regulation between signaling and gene expression that is difficult to capture with fixed-cell approaches. To study signaling dynamics and fate specification during preimplantation development, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing the ERK kinase translocation reporter and measured ERK activity in single cells of live embryos. Our results show primarily active ERK in both the inner cell mass and trophectoderm cells due to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. Strikingly, a subset of mitotic events results in a short pulse of ERK inactivity in both daughter cells that correlates with elevated endpoint NANOG levels. Moreover, endogenous tagging of Nanog in embryonic stem cells reveals that ERK inhibition promotes enhanced stabilization of NANOG protein after mitosis. Our data show that cell cycle, signaling, and differentiation are coordinated during preimplantation development.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial ribosomal RNAs are synthesized by a dedicated, conserved transcription-elongation complex that transcribes at high rates, shields RNA polymerase from premature termination, and supports co-transcriptional RNA folding, modification, processing, and ribosomal subunit assembly by presently unknown mechanisms. We have determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of complete Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA transcription elongation complexes, comprising RNA polymerase; DNA; RNA bearing an N-utilization-site-like anti-termination element; Nus factors A, B, E, and G; inositol mono-phosphatase SuhB; and ribosomal protein S4. Our structures and structure-informed functional analyses show that fast transcription and anti-termination involve suppression of NusA-stabilized pausing, enhancement of NusG-mediated anti-backtracking, sequestration of the NusG C-terminal domain from termination factor ρ, and the ρ blockade. Strikingly, the factors form a composite RNA chaperone around the RNA polymerase RNA-exit tunnel, which supports co-transcriptional RNA folding and annealing of distal RNA regions. Our work reveals a polymerase/chaperone machine required for biosynthesis of functional ribosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Like normal hematopoietic stem cells, leukemic stem cells depend on their bone marrow (BM) microenvironment for survival, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We have studied the contribution of nestin+ BM mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to MLL-AF9-driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development and chemoresistance in vivo. Unlike bulk stroma, nestin+ BMSC numbers are not reduced in AML, but their function changes to support AML cells, at the expense of non-mutated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Nestin+ cell depletion delays leukemogenesis in primary AML mice and selectively decreases AML, but not normal, cells in chimeric mice. Nestin+ BMSCs support survival and chemotherapy relapse of AML through increased oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, and glutathione (GSH)-mediated antioxidant defense. Therefore, AML cells co-opt energy sources and antioxidant defense mechanisms from BMSCs to survive chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The processes that control where higher eukaryotic cells initiate DNA replication throughout the genome are not understood clearly. In metazoans, the Treslin-MTBP complex mediates critical final steps in formation of the activated replicative helicase prior to initiation of replication. Here, we map the genome-wide distribution of the MTBP subunit of this complex in human cells. Our results indicate that MTBP binds to at least 30,000 sites in the genome. A majority of these sites reside in regions of open chromatin that contain transcriptional-regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers, and super-enhancers), which are known to be preferred areas for initiation of replication. Furthermore, many binding sites encompass two genomic features: a nucleosome-free DNA sequence (e.g., G-quadruplex DNA or AP-1 motif) and a nucleosome bearing histone marks characteristic of open chromatin, such as H3K4me2. Taken together, these findings indicate that Treslin-MTBP associates coordinately with multiple genomic signals to promote initiation of replication.

Abstract: Summary
SETD1A encodes a histone methyltransferase whose de novo mutations are identified in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and confer a large increase in disease risk. Here, we generate Setd1a mutant mice carrying the frameshift mutation that closely mimics a loss-of-function variant of SCZ. Our Setd1a (+/−) mice display various behavioral abnormalities relevant to features of SCZ, impaired excitatory synaptic transmission in layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and altered expression of diverse genes related to neurodevelopmental disorders and synaptic functions in the mPFC. RNAi-mediated Setd1a knockdown (KD) specifically in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mPFC only recapitulates impaired sociality among multiple behavioral abnormalities of Setd1a (+/−) mice. Optogenetics-assisted selective stimulation of presynaptic neurons combined with Setd1a KD reveals that Setd1a at postsynaptic site is essential for excitatory synaptic transmission. Our findings suggest that reduced SETD1A may attenuate excitatory synaptic function and contribute to the pathophysiology of SCZ.

Abstract: Summary
The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons has revolutionized Parkinson’s disease (PD) research, but single-cell transcriptomic analysis suggests unresolved cellular heterogeneity within these models. Here, we perform the largest single-cell transcriptomic study of human iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons to elucidate gene expression dynamics in response to cytotoxic and genetic stressors. We identify multiple neuronal subtypes with transcriptionally distinct profiles and differential sensitivity to stress, highlighting cellular heterogeneity in dopamine in vitro models. We validate this disease model by showing robust expression of PD GWAS genes and overlap with postmortem adult substantia nigra neurons. Importantly, stress signatures are ameliorated using felodipine, an FDA-approved drug. Using isogenic SNCA-A53T mutants, we find perturbations in glycolysis, cholesterol metabolism, synaptic signaling, and ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. Overall, our study reveals cell type-specific perturbations in human dopamine neurons, which will further our understanding of PD and have implications for cell replacement therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Effective spatio-temporal control of transcription and replication during S-phase is paramount to maintaining genomic integrity and cell survival. Dysregulation of these systems can lead to conflicts between the transcription and replication machinery, causing DNA damage and cell death. BRD4 allows efficient transcriptional elongation by stimulating phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We report that bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein loss of function (LOF) causes RNAPII pausing on the chromatin and DNA damage affecting cells in S-phase. This persistent RNAPII-dependent pausing leads to an accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) at sites of BRD4 occupancy, leading to transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), DNA damage, and cell death. Finally, our data show that the BRD4 C-terminal domain, which interacts with P-TEFb, is required to prevent R-loop formation and DNA damage caused by BET protein LOF.

Abstract: Summary
Spatiotemporal chromatin reorganization during hematopoietic differentiation has not been comprehensively characterized, mainly because of the large numbers of starting cells required for current chromatin conformation capture approaches. Here, we introduce a low-input tagmentation-based Hi-C (tagHi-C) method to capture the chromatin structures of hundreds of cells. Using tagHi-C, we are able to map the spatiotemporal dynamics of chromatin structure in ten primary hematopoietic stem, progenitor, and differentiated cell populations from mouse bone marrow. Our results reveal that changes in compartment dynamics and the Rabl configuration occur during hematopoietic cell differentiation. We identify gene-body-associating domains (GADs) as general structures for highly expressed genes. Moreover, we extend the body of knowledge regarding genes influenced by genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci through spatial chromatin looping. Our study provides the tagHi-C method for studying the three-dimensional (3D) genome of a small number of cells and maps the comprehensive 3D chromatin landscape of bone marrow hematopoietic cells.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian SWitch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling BAF (BRG1/BRM-associated factor) complex plays an essential role in developmental and pathological processes. We show that the deletion of Baf155, which encodes a subunit of the BAF complex, in the Tie2(+) lineage (Baf155 (CKO) leads to defects in yolk sac myeloid and definitive erythroid (EryD) lineage differentiation from erythromyeloid progenitors (EMPs). The chromatin of myeloid gene loci in Baf155 CKO EMPs is mostly inaccessible and enriched mainly by the ETS binding motif. BAF155 interacts with PU.1 and is recruited to PU.1 target gene loci together with p300 and KDM6a. Treatment of Baf155 CKO embryos with GSK126, an H3K27me2/3 methyltransferase EZH2 inhibitor, rescues myeloid lineage gene expression. This study uncovers indispensable BAF-mediated chromatin remodeling of myeloid gene loci at the EMP stage. Future studies exploiting epigenetics in the generation and application of EMP derivatives for tissue repair, regeneration, and disease are warranted.

Abstract: Summary
CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) persist at sites of previous infection, where they provide rapid local protection against pathogen challenge. CD8+ TRM expressing the α1 chain (CD49a) of integrin VLA-1 have been identified within sites of resolved skin infection and in vitiligo lesions. We demonstrate that CD49a is expressed early following T cell activation in vivo, and TGF-β and IL-12 induce CD49a expression by CD8+ T cells in vitro. Despite this rapid expression, CD49a is not required for the generation of a primary CD8+ T cell response to cutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, migration of CD8+ T cells across the epidermal basement membrane, or positioning of TRM within basal epidermis. Rather, CD49a supports CD8+ TRM persistence within skin, regulates epidermal CD8+ TRM dendritic extensions, and increases the frequency of IFN-γ+ CD8+ TRM following local antigen challenge. Our results suggest that CD49a promotes optimal cutaneous CD8+ TRM-mediated immunity.

Abstract: Summary
We reveal surprising similarities between homeostatic cell turnover in adult Drosophila midguts and “undead” apoptosis-induced compensatory proliferation (AiP) in imaginal discs. During undead AiP, immortalized cells signal for AiP, allowing its analysis. Critical for undead AiP is the Myo1D-dependent localization of the initiator caspase Dronc to the plasma membrane. Here, we show that Myo1D functions in mature enterocytes (ECs) to control mitotic activity of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). In Myo1D mutant midguts, many signaling events involved in AiP (ROS generation, hemocyte recruitment, and JNK signaling) are affected. Importantly, similar to AiP, Myo1D is required for membrane localization of Dronc in ECs. We propose that ECs destined to die transiently enter an undead-like state through Myo1D-dependent membrane localization of Dronc, which enables them to generate signals for ISC activity and their replacement. The concept of transiently “undead” cells may be relevant for other stem cell models in flies and mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Dendrite morphogenesis is essential for a neuron to establish its receptive field and is, thus, the anatomical basis for the proper functioning of the nervous system. The molecular mechanisms governing dendrite branching are not fully understood. Using the multi-dendritic PVD neuron in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we identify CATP-8/P5A ATPase as a key regulator of dendrite branching that controls the translocation of the DMA-1 receptor to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The specific signal peptide of DMA-1 and the ATPase activity of CATP-8 are essential for this process. Our results reveal that P5A ATPase may regulate protein translocation in the ER.

Abstract: Immune components were investigated in peripheral blood and in spleen and head kidney of autotriploid Salmo trutta f. lacustris, Salvelinus fontinalis, and Salvelinus umbla, and of allotriploid hybrids of S. trutta f. lacustris x Onchorynchus mykiss and S. fontinalis x O. mykiss in comparison to their diploid parents. In peripheral blood the number of lymphocytes was reduced in all investigated autotriploids and in the allotriploid S. trutta f. lacustris x O.mykiss, and the numbers of thrombocytes in autotriploid S. trutta f. lacustris and in both allotriploids. Alternative pathway of complement activity and immunoglobulin concentration were significantly decreased in all investigated auto- and allotriploids, lysozyme activity in autotriploid S. fontinalis and in both allotriploids. In the spleen of the 3 autotriploids the number of erythrocytes was increased, while the number of lymphoid precursor cells was decreased. In their head kidney the erythrocytes numbers were decreased and the numbers of erythropoietic precursor cells and the melanomacrophage centers were increased. Contrary, cytology of spleen and head kidney of the two allotriploid hybrids was similar to diploid controls. Caspase 1, caspase 6, lysozyme, and acid phosphatase activity and immunoglobulin concentration of spleen and head kidney showed specific changes which were related to cytological results. These data indicate alterations in immune system and in lymphoid organs of auto- and allotriploid Salmonidae.

Abstract: Summary
Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity such as synaptic scaling are critically dependent on transcription. Activity-dependent transcriptional dynamics in neurons, however, remain incompletely characterized because most previous efforts relied on measurement of steady-state mRNAs. Here, we use nascent RNA sequencing to profile transcriptional dynamics of primary neuron cultures undergoing network activity shifts. We find pervasive transcriptional changes, in which ∼45% of expressed genes respond to network activity shifts. We further link retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1), the Smith-Magenis syndrome gene, to the transcriptional program driven by reduced network activity. Remarkable agreement among nascent transcriptomes, dynamic chromatin occupancy of RAI1, and electrophysiological properties of Rai1-deficient neurons demonstrates the essential roles of RAI1 in suppressing synaptic upscaling in the naive network, while promoting upscaling triggered by activity silencing. These results highlight the utility of bona fide transcription profiling to discover mechanisms of activity-dependent chromatin remodeling that underlie normal and pathological synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas9-based gene drive systems possess the inherent capacity to spread progressively throughout target populations. Here we describe two self-copying (or active) guide RNA-only genetic elements, called e-CHACRs and ERACRs. These elements use Cas9 produced in trans by a gene drive either to inactivate the cas9 transgene (e-CHACRs) or to delete and replace the gene drive (ERACRs). e-CHACRs can be inserted at various genomic locations and carry two or more gRNAs, the first copying the e-CHACR and the second mutating and inactivating the cas9 transgene. Alternatively, ERACRs are inserted at the same genomic location as a gene drive, carrying two gRNAs that cut on either side of the gene drive to excise it. e-CHACRs efficiently inactivate Cas9 and can drive to completion in cage experiments. Similarly, ERACRs, particularly those carrying a recoded cDNA-restoring endogenous gene activity, can drive reliably to fully replace a gene drive. We compare the strengths of these two systems.

Abstract: Summary
Effector regulatory T (eTreg) cells are essential for immune tolerance and depend upon T cell receptor (TCR) signals for generation. The immunometabolic signaling mechanisms that promote the differentiation and maintenance of eTreg cells remain unclear. Here, we show that isoprenoid-dependent posttranslational lipid modifications dictate eTreg cell accumulation and function by intersecting with TCR-induced intracellular signaling. We find that isoprenoids are essential for activated Treg cell suppressive activity, and Treg cell-specific deletion of the respective farnesylation- and geranylgeranylation-promoting enzymes Fntb or Pggt1b leads to the development of fatal autoimmunity, associated with reduced eTreg cell accumulation. Mechanistically, Fntb promotes eTreg cell maintenance by regulating mTORC1 activity and ICOS expression. In contrast, Pggt1b acts as a rheostat of TCR-dependent transcriptional programming and Rac-mediated signaling for establishment of eTreg cell differentiation and immune tolerance. Therefore, our results identify bidirectional metabolic signaling, specifically between immunoreceptor signaling and metabolism-mediated posttranslational lipid modifications, for the differentiation and maintenance of eTreg cells.

Abstract: Summary
Acquired resistance to BH3 mimetic antagonists of BCL-2 and MCL-1 is an important clinical problem. Using acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of acquired resistance to BCL-2 (venetoclax) and MCL-1 (S63845) antagonists, we identify common principles of resistance and persistent vulnerabilities to overcome resistance. BH3 mimetic resistance is characterized by decreased mitochondrial apoptotic priming as measured by BH3 profiling, both in PDX models and human clinical samples, due to alterations in BCL-2 family proteins that vary among cases, but not to acquired mutations in leukemia genes. BCL-2 inhibition drives sequestered pro-apoptotic proteins to MCL-1 and vice versa, explaining why in vivo combinations of BCL-2 and MCL-1 antagonists are more effective when concurrent rather than sequential. Finally, drug-induced mitochondrial priming measured by dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP) identifies drugs that are persistently active in BH3 mimetic-resistant myeloblasts, including FLT-3 inhibitors and SMAC mimetics.

Abstract: The β-class of carbonic anhydrases (β-CAs) are zinc metalloenzymes widely distributed in the fungal kingdom that play essential roles in growth, survival, differentiation, and virulence by catalyzing the reversible interconversion of–carbon dioxide (CO2) and bicarbonate (HCO3-). Herein, we report the biochemical and crystallographic characterization of the β-CA CafA from the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, the main causative agent of invasive aspergillosis. CafA exhibited apparent in vitro CO2 hydration activity in neutral to weak alkaline conditions, but little activity at acidic pH. The high-resolution crystal structure of CafA revealed a tetramer comprising a dimer of dimers, in which the catalytic zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by three conserved residues (C119, H175, C178) and an acetate anion presumably acquired from the crystallization solution, indicating a freely accessible ″open″ conformation. Furthermore, knowledge of the structure of CafA in complex with the potent inhibitor acetazolamide, together with its functional intolerance of nitrate (NO3-) ions, could be exploited to develop new antifungal agents for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

Abstract: Summary
Specific combinations of two transcription factors (Hnf4α plus Foxa1, Foxa2, or Foxa3) can induce direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts into hepatocyte-like cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic reprogramming are largely unknown. Here, we show that the Foxa protein family members and Hnf4α sequentially and cooperatively bind to chromatin to activate liver-specific gene expression. Although all Foxa proteins bind to and open regions of closed chromatin as pioneer factors, Foxa3 has the unique potential of transferring from the distal to proximal regions of the transcription start site of target genes, binding RNA polymerase II, and co-traversing target genes. These distinctive characteristics of Foxa3 are essential for inducing the hepatic fate in fibroblasts. Similar functional coupling of transcription factors to RNA polymerase II may occur in other contexts whereby transcriptional activation can induce cell differentiation.

Abstract: As pivotal players in cellular metabolism, mitochondria have a double-faceted role in the final decision of cell fate. This is true for all cell types, but it is even more important and intriguing in the cancer setting. Mitochondria regulate cell fate in many diverse ways: through metabolism, by producing ATP and other metabolites deemed vital or detrimental for cancer cells; through the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, especially by the joint participation of the endoplasmic reticulum in a membranous tethering system for Ca2+ signaling called mitochondria-ER associated membranes (MAMs); and by regulating signaling pathways involved in the survival of cancer cells such as mitophagy. Recent studies have shown that mitochondria can also play a role in the regulation of inflammatory pathways in cancer cells, for example, through the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) involved in the activation of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway. In this review, we aim to explore the role of mitochondria as decision makers in fostering cancer cell death or survival depending on the tumor cell stage and describe novel anticancer therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal L cells regulate a wide range of metabolic processes, and L-cell dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. However, it is incompletely understood how luminal signals are integrated to control the development of L cells. Here we show that food availability and gut microbiota-produced short-chain fatty acids control the posttranslational modification on intracellular proteins by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in intestinal epithelial cells. Via FOXO1 O-GlcNAcylation, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) suppresses expression of the lineage-specifying transcription factor Neurogenin 3 and, thus, L cell differentiation from enteroendocrine progenitors. Intestinal epithelial ablation of OGT in mice not only causes L cell hyperplasia and increased secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) but also disrupts gut microbial compositions, which notably contributes to decreased weight gain and improved glycemic control. Our results identify intestinal epithelial O-GlcNAc signaling as a brake on L cell development and function in response to nutritional and microbial cues.

Abstract: Summary
Various processes induce and maintain immune tolerance, but effector T cells still arise under minimal perturbations of homeostasis through unclear mechanisms. We report that, contrary to the model postulating primarily tolerogenic mechanisms initiated under homeostatic conditions, effector programming is an integral part of T cell fate determination induced by antigenic activation in the steady state. This effector programming depends on a two-step process starting with induction of effector precursors that express Hopx and are imprinted with multiple instructions for their subsequent terminal effector differentiation. Such molecular circuits advancing specific terminal effector differentiation upon re-stimulation include programmed expression of interferon-γ, whose production then promotes expression of T-bet in the precursors. We further show that effector programming coincides with regulatory conversion among T cells sharing the same antigen specificity. However, conventional type 2 dendritic cells (cDC2) and T cell functions of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) increase effector precursor induction while decreasing the proportion of T cells that can become peripheral Foxp3+ regulatory T (pTreg) cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cells, from microbes to mammals, adapt their membrane lipid composition in response to environmental changes to maintain optimal properties. Global patterns of lipidome remodeling are poorly understood, particularly in organisms with simple lipid compositions that can provide insight into fundamental principles of membrane adaptation. Using shotgun lipidomics, we examine the simple yet, as we show here, adaptive lipidome of the plant-associated Gram-negative bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens. We observe that minimally 11 lipids account for 90% of total variability, thus constraining the upper limit of variable lipids required for an adaptive living membrane. Through lipid features analysis, we reveal that acyl chain remodeling is not evenly distributed across lipid classes, resulting in headgroup-specific effects of acyl chain variability on membrane properties. Results herein implicate headgroup-specific acyl chain remodeling as a mechanism for fine-tuning the membrane’s physical state and provide a resource for using M. extorquens to explore the design principles of living membranes.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factor EB (TFEB) activates lysosomal biogenesis genes in response to environmental cues. Given implications of impaired TFEB signaling and lysosomal dysfunction in metabolic, neurological, and infectious diseases, we aim to systematically identify TFEB-directed circuits by examining transcriptional responses to TFEB subcellular localization and stimulation. We reveal that steady-state nuclear TFEB is sufficient to activate transcription of lysosomal, autophagy, and innate immunity genes, whereas other targets require higher thresholds of stimulation. Furthermore, we identify shared and distinct transcriptional signatures between mTOR inhibition and bacterial autophagy. Using a genome-wide CRISPR library, we find TFEB targets that protect cells from or sensitize cells to lysosomal cell death. BHLHE40 and BHLHE41, genes responsive to high, sustained levels of nuclear TFEB, act in opposition to TFEB upon lysosomal cell death induction. Further investigation identifies genes counter-regulated by TFEB and BHLHE40/41, adding this negative feedback to the current understanding of TFEB regulatory mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Hemopexin (Hx) is a scavenger of labile heme. Herein, we present data defining the role of tumor stroma-expressed Hx in suppressing cancer progression. Labile heme and Hx levels are inversely correlated in the plasma of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Further, low expression of Hx in PCa biopsies characterizes poorly differentiated tumors and correlates with earlier time to relapse. Significantly, heme promotes tumor growth and metastases in an orthotopic murine model of PCa, with the most aggressive phenotype detected in mice lacking Hx. Mechanistically, labile heme accumulates in the nucleus and modulates specific gene expression via interacting with guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA structures to promote PCa growth. We identify c-MYC as a heme:G4-regulated gene and a major player in heme-driven cancer progression. Collectively, these results reveal that sequestration of labile heme by Hx may block heme-driven tumor growth and metastases, suggesting a potential strategy to prevent and/or arrest cancer dissemination.

Abstract: Summary
Individuals with Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) display hyperactivation of interferon (IFN) signaling and chronic inflammation, which could potentially be explained by the extra copy of four IFN receptor (IFNR) genes encoded on chromosome 21. However, the clinical effects of IFN hyperactivity in DS remain undefined. Here, we report that a commonly used mouse model of DS overexpresses IFNR genes and shows hypersensitivity to IFN ligands in diverse immune cell types. When treated repeatedly with a TLR3 agonist to induce chronic inflammation, these animals overexpress key IFN-stimulated genes, induce cytokine production, exhibit liver pathology, and undergo rapid weight loss. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity and cytokine production and the ensuing pathology are ameliorated by JAK1 inhibition. These results indicate that individuals with DS may experience harmful hyperinflammation upon IFN-inducing immune stimuli, as observed during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, pointing to JAK1 inhibition as a strategy to restore immune homeostasis in DS.

Abstract: Time and cost-effective production of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the performance of population-scale comparative and evolutionary studies for various species, which are essential for obtaining the comprehensive insight into molecular mechanisms underlying species- or breed-specific traits. In this study, the evolutionary and functional analysis of Korean native pig (KNP) was performed using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data by comparative and population genomic approaches with six different mammalian species and five pig breeds. We examined the evolutionary history of KNP SNPs, and the specific genes of KNP based on the uniqueness of non-synonymous SNPs among the used species and pig breeds. We discovered the evolutionary trajectory of KNP SNPs within the used mammalian species as well as pig breeds. We also found olfaction-associated functions that have been characterized and diversified during evolution, and quantitative trait loci associated with the unique traits of KNP. Our study provides new insight into the evolution of KNP and serves as a good example for a better understanding of domestic animals in terms of evolution and domestication using the combined approaches of comparative and population genomics.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal endosomal dysfunction, the earliest known pathobiology specific to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is mediated by the aberrant activation of Rab5 triggered by APP-β secretase cleaved C-terminal fragment (APP-βCTF). To distinguish pathophysiological consequences specific to overactivated Rab5 itself, we activate Rab5 independently from APP-βCTF in the PA-Rab5 mouse model. We report that Rab5 overactivation alone recapitulates diverse prodromal and degenerative features of AD. Modest neuron-specific transgenic Rab5 expression inducing hyperactivation of Rab5 comparable to that in AD brain reproduces AD-related Rab5-endosomal enlargement and mistrafficking, hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits via accelerated AMPAR endocytosis and dendritic spine loss, and tau hyperphosphorylation via activated glycogen synthase kinase-3β. Importantly, Rab5-mediated endosomal dysfunction induces progressive cholinergic neurodegeneration and impairs hippocampal-dependent memory. Aberrant neuronal Rab5-endosome signaling, therefore, drives a pathogenic cascade distinct from β-amyloid-related neurotoxicity, which includes prodromal and neurodegenerative features of AD, and suggests Rab5 overactivation as a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin system regulates the DNA damage response (DDR) by modifying histone H2A at Lys15 (H2AK15ub) and triggering downstream signaling events. Here, we find that phosphorylation of ubiquitin at Thr12 (pUbT12) controls the DDR by inhibiting the function of 53BP1, a key factor for DNA double-strand break repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Detectable as a chromatin modification on H2AK15ub, pUbT12 accumulates in nuclear foci and is increased upon DNA damage. Mutating Thr12 prevents the removal of ubiquitin from H2AK15ub by USP51 deubiquitinating enzyme, leading to a pronounced accumulation of ubiquitinated chromatin. Chromatin modified by pUbT12 is inaccessible to 53BP1 but permissive to the homologous recombination (HR) proteins RNF169, RAD51, and the BRCA1/BARD1 complex. Phosphorylation of ubiquitin at Thr12 in the chromatin context is a new histone mark, H2AK15pUbT12, that regulates the DDR by hampering the activity of 53BP1 at damaged chromosomes.
