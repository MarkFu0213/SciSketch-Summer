Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in organisms. To understand the underlying mechanisms behind the molecular response of the crab to low salt-stress, high-throughput Illumina/Solexa deep sequencing technology was used to investigate the expression profiles of miRNAs under low salinity challenged. Two mixed RNA pool libraries of gill tissues from low salinity challenged (LC) and the control groups (NC) were sequenced on the Illumina platform. A total of 6,166,057 and 7,032,973 high-quality reads were obtained from the NC and LC libraries, respectively. Sixty-seven miRNAs consisting of 16 known and 51 novel ones were identified, among which, 12 miRNAs were differentially expressed in LC compared to NC. Thirty-four of the target genes predicted were differentially expressed in the opposite direction to the miRNAs, which were involved in crucial processes related to osmoregulation by gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis, such as anion transport processes (GO:0006820) and chitin metabolic process (GO:0006030). These results provide a basis for further investigation of the miRNA-modulating networks in osmoregulation of Portunus trituberculatus.

Abstract: Summary
Cysteine cathepsins are lysosomal proteases involved in regulation of both normal cellular processes and disease. Biochemical studies with peptide substrates indicate that cathepsins have optimal activity at acidic pH and highly attenuated activity at neutral pH. In contrast, there is mounting evidence that cathepsins have biological roles in environments that have non-acidic pH. To further define the specific pH environments where cathepsins act, we designed bifunctional activity-based probes (ABPs) that allow simultaneous analysis of cathepsin protease activity and pH. We use these probes to analyze the steady-state environment of cathepsin activity in macrophages and to measure dynamic changes in activity and pH upon stimulation. We show that Salmonella typhimurium induces a change in lysosomal pH that ultimately impairs cathepsin activity in both infected cells and a fraction of bystander cells, highlighting a mechanism by which Salmonella can simultaneously flourish within host cells and alter the behavior of nearby uninfected cells.

Abstract: Culture of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under ambient conditions does not replicate the low oxygen environment of normal physiological or pathological states and can result in cellular impairment during culture. To overcome these limitations, we explored the effect of hypoxia (1 % O2) on the biological characteristics of MSCs over the course of different culture periods. The following biological characteristics were examined in human bone marrow-derived MSCs cultured under hypoxia for 8 weeks: proliferation rate, morphology, cell size, senescence, immunophenotypic characteristics, and the expression levels of stemness-associated factors and cytokine and chemokine genes. MSCs cultured under hypoxia for approximately 2 weeks showed increased proliferation and viability. During long-term culture, hypoxia delayed phenotypic changes in MSCs, such as increased cell volume, altered morphology, and the expression of senescence-associated-β-gal, without altering their characteristic immunophenotypic characteristics. Furthermore, hypoxia increased the expression of stemness and chemokine-related genes, including OCT4 and CXCR7, and did not decrease the expression of KLF4, C-MYC, CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCR4 compared with levels in cells cultured under normoxia. In conclusion, low oxygen tension improved the biological characteristics of MSCs during ex vivo expansion. These data suggest that hypoxic culture could be a useful method for increasing the efficacy of MSC cell therapies.

Abstract: Lipoprotein receptor family members hold multiple roles in the brain, and alterations in lipoprotein receptor expression and function are implicated in neuronal stress, developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Berberine (BBR), a nutraceutical shown to have both neuroprotective and neurotoxic properties, is suggested to regulate lipoprotein receptor expression. We show that subtoxic concentration of BBR regulates neuronal lipoprotein receptor expression in a receptor- and time-dependent fashion in cerebellar granule neurons (CGN). Similarly to BBR, subtoxic concentrations of neuronal stressors cobalt chloride, thapsigargin and rotenone increased very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) mRNA and protein expression in CGN suggesting a conserved pathway for stress-induced upregulation of VLDLR in neurons. We also show that VLDLR upregulation is accompanied by transiently increased stabilization of hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and decreased β-catenin levels affecting the Wnt pathway through GSK3β phosphorylation, a crucial player in neurodegenerative processes. Our results indicate that neuronal stress differentially regulates lipoprotein receptor expression in neurons, with VLDLR upregulation as a common element as a modulator of neuronal Wnt signaling.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA and play crucial roles in a wide array of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Our previous studies found that homocysteine(Hcy) can stimulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), however, the underlying mechanisms were not fully elucidated. Here, we found proliferation of VSMCs induced by Hcy was of correspondence to the miR-125b expression reduced both in vitro and in the ApoE knockout mice, the hypermethylation of p53, its decreased expression, and DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) up-regulated. And, we found DNMT3b is a target of miR-125b, which was verified by the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay and western blotting. Besides, the siRNA interference for DNMT3b significantly decreased the methylation level of p53, which unveiled the causative role of DNMT3b in p53 hypermethylation. miR-125b transfection further confirmed its regulative roles on p53 gene methylation status and the VSMCs proliferation. Our data suggested that a miR-125b-DNMT3b-p53 signal pathway may exist in the VSMCs proliferation induced by Hcy.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming to pluripotency after overexpression of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC is accompanied by global genomic and epigenomic changes. Histone modification and DNA methylation states in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been shown to be highly similar to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, epigenetic differences still exist between iPSCs and ESCs. In particular, aberrant DNA methylation states found in iPSCs are a major concern when using iPSCs in a clinical setting. Thus, it is critical to find factors that regulate DNA methylation states in reprogramming. Here, we found that the miR-29 family is an important epigenetic regulator during human somatic cell reprogramming. Our global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation analysis shows that DNA demethylation is a major event mediated by miR-29a depletion during early reprogramming, and that iPSCs derived from miR-29a depletion are epigenetically closer to ESCs. Our findings uncover an important miRNA-based approach to generate clinically robust iPSCs.

Hyper-O-GlcNAcylation of YB-1 affects Ser102 phosphorylation and promotes cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma,

Abstract: As an essential post-translational modification, O-GlcNAcylation has been thought to be able to modulate various nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins and is emerging as a key regulator of multiple biological processes, such as transcription, cell growth, signal transduction, and cell motility. Recently, authoritative glycomics analyses have reported extensive crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, which always dynamically interplay with each other and regulate signaling, transcription, and other cellular processes. Also, plentiful studies have shown close correlation between YB-1 phosphorylation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, our study aimed to determine whether YB-1 was O-GlcNAc modified and whether such modification could interact with its phosphorylation during the process of HCC development. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were firstly conducted to reveal obvious up-regulation of YB-1, OGT and O-GlcNAc modification in HCC tissues. What is more, not only YB-1 was identified to be O-GlcNAcylated but hyper-O-GlcNAcylation was demonstrated to facilitate HCC cell proliferation in a YB-1 dependent manner. Moreover, we detected four specific O-GlcNAc sites and confirmed T126A to be the most effective mutant in HCC cell proliferation via close O-GlcNAcylation-phosphorylation interaction. Even more interestingly, we discovered that T126A-induced HCC cell retardation and subdued transcriptional activity of YB-1 could be partially reversed by T126A/S102E mutant. From all above, it is not difficult to find that glycosylated-YB-1 mainly enhanced cell proliferation through congenerous actions with YB-1 phosphorylation and thus played indispensable roles in fine-tuning cell proliferation and procession of HCC.

Abstract: This chapter introduces the principles and advantages of selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) and compares it to commonly used epifluorescence or confocal setups. Due to the low phototoxicity, speed of imaging, high penetration depth, and spatiotemporal resolution, SPIM is predestined for in vivo imaging but can as well be used for in toto analysis of large fixed samples. Key points of light-sheet microscopy are highlighted and discussed priming the investigator to choose the best suitable system from the large collection of possible SPIM setups. Mounting of samples is shown and the demands for data acquisition, processing, handling, and visualization are discussed.

Abstract: Gene expression analysis is increasingly important in many fields of biological research. Understanding patterns of expressed genes is assumed to provide insight into complex regulatory networks and can lead to the identification of genes relevant to specific biological processes, including disease. Among different techniques, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is currently regarded as the gold standard for targeted quantification of RNA gene expression, especially because of its high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision, and also because of its practical simplicity and processing speed. However, different critical factors can influence the outcome of RT-qPCR studies, including isolation of RNA, reverse transcription to cDNA, and data analysis. These factors need to be addressed in order to obtain biologically meaningful results. In this chapter, we describe how RT-qPCR can be used in a reliable way to successfully study differential gene expression in zebrafish. Hereby, we especially focus on how expressed repetitive elements can be employed as reference targets in zebrafish RT-qPCR studies and how they can further improve the quality of the data.

Abstract: A mutation in VAPB causes a familial form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The mutant protein (VAPB-P56S) is aggregate prone and blocks retrograde traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) including trafficking to the nuclear envelope (NE). Here we report a morphological screen where overexpression of oxysterol binding protein-related protein-3 (ORP3) rescued the mutant VAPB phenotype. It resolved the mutant VAPB-induced membrane expansions, restored solubility of the mutant protein in non-ionic detergent, and restored trafficking of Emerin to the NE. Knockdown of ORP3 or VAPB increased the intracellular level of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P). Decreasing PtdIns4P levels by inhibiting its synthesis reduced the severity of the mutant VAPB-induced membrane expansions and restored Emerin trafficking to the NE. Thus, VAPB and its interacting partners cooperatively regulate protein trafficking through the ERGIC by modulating PtdIns4P levels.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) are a promising class of targeted cancer drugs, but their individual target profiles beyond the PARP family, which could result in differential clinical use or toxicity, are unknown. Using an unbiased, mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics approach, we generated a comparative proteome-wide target map of the four clinical PARPi, olaparib, veliparib, niraparib, and rucaparib. PARPi as a class displayed high target selectivity. However, in addition to the canonical targets PARP1, PARP2, and several of their binding partners, we also identified hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) and deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) as previously unrecognized targets of rucaparib and niraparib, respectively. Subsequent functional validation suggested that inhibition of DCK by niraparib could have detrimental effects when combined with nucleoside analog pro-drugs. H6PD silencing can cause apoptosis and further sensitize cells to PARPi, suggesting that H6PD may be, in addition to its established role in metabolic disorders, a new anticancer target.

Abstract: Heat shock protein gene (Hsp) families are thought to be important in thermal adaptation, but their expression patterns under various thermal stresses have still been poorly characterized outside of model systems. We have therefore characterized Hsp genes and their stress responses in the oriental fruit moth (OFM), Grapholita molesta, a widespread global orchard pest, and compared patterns of expression in this species to that of other insects. Genes from four Hsp families showed variable expression levels among tissues and developmental stages. Members of the Hsp40, 70, and 90 families were highly expressed under short exposures to heat and cold. Expression of Hsp40, 70, and Hsc70 family members increased in OFM undergoing diapause, while Hsp90 was downregulated. We found that there was strong sequence conservation of members of large Hsp families (Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsc70) across taxa, but this was not always matched by conservation of expression patterns. When the large Hsps as well as small Hsps from OFM were compared under acute and ramping heat stress, two groups of sHsps expression patterns were apparent, depending on whether expression increased or decreased immediately after stress exposure. These results highlight potential differences in conservation of function as opposed to sequence in this gene family and also point to Hsp genes potentially useful as bioindicators of diapause and thermal stress in OFM.

Abstract: Summary
Infection with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) can lead to Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a lethal form of skin cancer. However, the skin cell type productively infected by MCPyV remains a central question. We combined cell culture and ex vivo approaches to identify human dermal fibroblasts as natural host cells that support productive MCPyV infection. Based on this, we established a cell culture model for MCPyV infection, which will facilitate investigation of the oncogenic mechanisms for this DNA virus. Using this model, we discovered that induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes by the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and other growth factors stimulates MCPyV infection. This suggests that MCC risk factors such as UV radiation and aging, which are known to stimulate WNT signaling and MMP expression, may promote viral infection and thus drive MCC. Our study also introduces the FDA-approved MEK antagonist trametinib as an effective inhibitor for controlling MCPyV infection.

Abstract: Summary
In mammalian cells, the second messenger (2′–5′,3′–5′) cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (2′,3′-cGAMP), is produced by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAMP synthase (cGAS), and subsequently bound by the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to trigger interferon response. Thus, the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway plays a critical role in pathogen detection, as well as pathophysiological conditions including cancer and autoimmune disorders. However, studying and targeting this immune signaling pathway has been challenging due to the absence of tools for high-throughput analysis. We have engineered an RNA-based fluorescent biosensor that responds to 2′,3′-cGAMP. The resulting “mix-and-go” cGAS activity assay shows excellent statistical reliability as a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay and distinguishes between direct and indirect cGAS inhibitors. Furthermore, the biosensor enables quantitation of 2′,3′-cGAMP in mammalian cell lysates. We envision this biosensor-based assay as a resource to study the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway in the context of infectious diseases, cancer immunotherapy, and autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Increased activity of the endocannabinoid system has emerged as a pathogenic factor in visceral obesity, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The endocannabinoid system is composed of at least two G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), and the cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2). Downregulation of CB1 activity in rodents and humans has proven efficacious to reduce food intake, abdominal adiposity, fasting glucose levels, and cardiometabolic risk factors. Unfortunately, downregulation of CB1 activity by universally active CB1 inverse agonists has been found to elicit psychiatric side effects, which led to the termination of using globally active CB1 inverse agonists to treat diet-induced obesity. Interestingly, preclinical studies have shown that downregulation of CB1 activity by CB1 neutral antagonists or peripherally restricted CB1 inverse agonists provided similar anorectic effects and metabolic benefits without psychiatric side effects seen in globally active CB1 inverse agonists. Furthermore, downregulation of CB1 activity may ease endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stress which are contributors to obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. This suggests new approaches for cannabinoid-based therapy in the management of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: It is well known that vitamin A and its receptors protect against cancer development and that Retinoid Acid Receptor β (RARβ) is epigenetically silenced during tumoral progression. Cervical Cancer (CC) has been causally linked to high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. However, host factors are important in determining the outcome of persistent HR-HPV infection as most cervical precancerous lesions containing HR-HPVs do not progress to invasive carcinomas. Increasing evidence suggests that low diet in vitamin A and their receptors participate in the development of CC. The aim of this study has been to investigate the effects of abated RARβ expression in the development of cervical premalignant lesions in 4 month-old conditional mice (RARβL−/L−). Results demonstrated the development of spontaneous squamous metaplasia, inflammatory infiltrate, enhanced mitotic activity, loss of cell differentiation, as well as decreased apoptosis and p16INK4a protein levels in RARβL−/L− mice cervix. All these changes are hallmarks of moderate dysplasia. Importantly, our results suggest that the low expression of RARβ, may induce the down regulation of p16INK4a, chronic inflammation and decreased apoptosis and may be involved in vulnerability to HR-HPV and early stage cervical carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The timing, location, and level of WNT signaling are highly regulated during embryonic development and for the maintenance of adult tissues. Consequently the ability to provide a defined and directed source of WNT proteins is crucial to fully understand its role in tissue development and to mimic its activity in vitro. Here we describe a one-step immobilization technique to covalently bind WNT3A proteins as a basal surface with easy storage and long-lasting activity. We show that this platform is able to maintain adult and embryonic stem cells while also being adaptable for 3D systems. Therefore, this platform could be used for recapitulating specific stem cell niches with the goal of improving tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are fast proliferating cells capable of differentiating into all somatic cell types. In somatic cells, it is well documented that p53 is rapidly activated upon DNA damage to arrest the cell cycle and induce apoptosis. In mouse ESCs, p53 can also be functionally activated, but the precise biological consequences are not well characterized. Here, we demonstrated that doxorubicin treatment initially led to cell-cycle arrest at G2/M in ESCs, followed by the occurrence of massive apoptosis. Neither p53 nor its target gene p73 was required for G2/M arrest. Instead, p53 and p73 were fully responsible for apoptosis. p53 and p73 were also required for differentiation-induced apoptosis in mouse ESCs. In addition, doxorubicin treatment induced the expression of retinoblastoma protein in a p53-dependent manner. Therefore, both p53 and p73 are critical in apoptosis induced by DNA damage and differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Meiosis is the key step in gametogenesis. However, the mechanism of mammalian meiosis remains poorly understood due to the lack of an in vitro model. Here, we report that retinoic acid (RA) is sufficient for inducing leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes from cultured mouse spermatogonial stem cells. Multiple genes regulated by RA were identified by RNA sequencing. RA in combination with pup Sertoli cell co-culture resulted in a higher induction efficiency of 28%. Comparisons in the transcriptomic profiles of the induced spermatogenic cells and the isolated ones revealed the progressive induction of the germ cells. Using this model, we showed that Stra8, Agpat3, Fam57a, Wdr91, and Sox30 contributed to the proliferation and meiosis initiation differentially. In conclusion, we have efficiently generated spermatocytes using an RA/pup Sertoli cell-based in vitro model and provided proof-of-concept evidence for its application in identifying genes involved in mammalian meiosis.

Abstract: Summary
Tight regulation of the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of neural stem cells is crucial to assure proper neural development. In this context, Notch signaling is a well-known promoter of stemness. In contrast, the bifunctional brain-enriched microRNA miR-9/9∗ has been implicated in promoting neuronal differentiation. Therefore, we set out to explore the role of both regulators in human neural stem cells. We found that miR-9/9∗ decreases Notch activity by targeting NOTCH2 and HES1, resulting in an enhanced differentiation. Vice versa, expression levels of miR-9/9∗ depend on the activation status of Notch signaling. While Notch inhibits differentiation of neural stem cells, it also induces miR-9/9∗ via recruitment of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD)/RBPj transcriptional complex to the miR-9/9∗_2 genomic locus. Thus, our data reveal a mutual interaction between bifunctional miR-9/9∗ and the Notch signaling cascade, calibrating the delicate balance between self-renewal and differentiation of human neural stem cells.

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune-mediated disease with a pathogenesis that involves CD4 T cell activation. Multiple immune regulatory molecules expressed on CD4+ T cells were involved in RA pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the role of T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif) domain (TIGIT) in RA. The frequency of TIGIT-positive CD4+ T cells in the synovial fluid (SF) of active RA patients was lower than that of inactive RA patients. And a negative correlation between RA disease activity and TIGIT expression was found. In CD4+ T cells isolated from SF of active RA patients, TIGIT upregulation significantly decreased cell proliferation, as shown by MTT assay. TIGIT overexpression also significantly decreased the production of IFN-γ and IL-17, and increased that of IL-10, as determined by ELISA and qRT-PCR. In CD4+ T cells isolated from SF of inactive RA patients, TIGIT was silenced by siRNA transfection. As expected, TIGIT knockdown resulted in an opposite effect on cell proliferation and the production of cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-17 and IL-10. A RA mouse model was established using type II collagen induction. TIGIT was upregulated in RA mouse by lentivector infection. As expected, TIGIT overexpression in vivo significantly alleviated the disease severity and deceased the levels of anti-collagen II antibodies. TIGIT upregulation in the early stage was more effective to alleviate disease severity. Our data suggested the potential therapeutic role of TIGIT in RA patients.

Abstract: Artesunate (ARS), an artemisinin derivative, has been demonstrated to possess antitumor activity in various human tumor cells. This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism by which ARS induces apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh-7 and Hep3B cells). ARS effectively induced externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), depolarization of mitochondrial membrane, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and activation of caspase-9 and 3, characteristics of the intrinsic apoptosis. Pretreatment with antioxidant N-Acetyle-Cysteine (NAC) completely blocked ARS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis in the two cell lines. ARS increased cellular iron ions level in Huh-7/Hep3B cells, but decreased cellular iron ions level in HepG2 cells. Pifithrin-alpha (PFT), an inhibitor of p53, significantly enhanced ARS-induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells, and the forced expression of wild-type p53 significantly enhanced ARS-induced cytotoxicity in Hep3B cells. In addition, ARS induced translocation and activation of the proapoptotic Bax, and silencing Bax remarkably inhibited ARS-induced apoptosis and ΔΨm collapse in Huh-7 and Hep3B cells, demonstrating the key role of Bax in ARS-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ARS induces ROS-dependent apoptosis via a Bax-mediated intrinsic pathway in Huh-7 and Hep3B cells.

Abstract: Septins are cytoskeletal proteins involved in diverse biological processes including cytokinesis, cell morphogenesis, motility, and ciliogenesis. Septins form various filamentous structures in vitro and in vivo, but the higher-order architecture of septin structures in vivo remains poorly defined. The best understood system in this respect is the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where septins form a ring structure that undergoes multiple stages of remodeling during the cell cycle. In this chapter, we describe a method for visualizing supramolecular septin structures in yeast at high spatial resolution using platinum replica electron microscopy. This approach can be applied to further understand the regulation of assembly and remodeling of septin higher-order structures, as well as the relationship between septin architecture and function.

Abstract: The minimal functional units of the mammalian septin system are diverse heterooligomers of SEPT1-14 subunits, which are most abundantly and differentially expressed in postmitotic neurons and glia. The subunit compositions of such heterooligomers are thought to differentiate their affinity for other proteins and lipids, and subcellular localization. Thus, high-precision quantification and mapping of each subunit is necessary to understand their subcellular functions and physiological roles. However, systematic information on the localization of individual septin subunits in the mammalian nervous system is limited. Here, we present our experimental workflows for the study of septin expression and localization in the rodent brain by immunoblot and serial section immunoelectron microscopy. Our protocols, based on standard methods, have been rigorously optimized and simplified for universality and reproducibility to aid non-experts in the field.

Abstract: Summary
Human monocytes respond to arachidonic acid, a secretory product of endothelial cells, by activating the de novo pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis, resulting in the acquisition of a foamy phenotype due to accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Recruitment of foamy monocytes to endothelium is a key step in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Here we describe that lipid droplets of foamy monocytes are enriched in a rather uncommon fatty acid, cis-7-hexadecenoic acid (16:1n-9), a positional isomer of palmitoleic acid. 16:1n-9 was found to possess an anti-inflammatory activity both in vitro and in vivo that is comparable with that of omega-3 fatty acids and clearly distinguishable from the effects of palmitoleic acid. Selective accumulation in neutral lipids of phagocytic cells of an uncommon fatty acid reveals an early phenotypic change that may provide a biomarker of proatherogenicity, and a potential target for intervention in the early stages of cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: It has been established that the synthesis of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is temperature-dependent. The Hsp70 response is considered as a cellular thermometer in response to heat stress and other stimuli. The variation in Hsp70 gene expression has been positively correlated with thermotolerance in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, rodents and human. Goats have a wide range of ecological adaptability due to their anatomical and physiological characteristics; however, the productivity of the individual declines during thermal stress. The present study was carried out to analyze the expression of heat shock proteins in different tissues and to contrast heat stress phenotypes in response to chronic heat stress. The investigation has been carried out in Jamunapari, Barbari, Jakhrana and Sirohi goats. These breeds differ in size, coat colour and production performance. The heat stress assessment in goats was carried out at a temperature humidity index (THI) ranging from 85.36–89.80 over the period. Phenotyping for heat stress susceptibility was carried out by combining respiration rate (RR) and heart rate (HR). Based on the distribution of RR and HR over the breeds in the population, individual animals were recognized as heat stress-susceptible (HSS) and heat stress-tolerant (HST). Based on their physiological responses, the selected animals were slaughtered for tissue collection during peak heat stress periods. The tissue samples from different organs such as liver, spleen, heart, testis, brain and lungs were collected and stored at −70°C for future use. Hsp70 concentrations were analyzed from tissue extract with ELISA. mRNA expression levels were evaluated using the SYBR green method. Kidney, liver and heart had 1.5–2.0-fold higher Hsp70 concentrations as compared to other organs in the tissue extracts. Similarly, the gene expression pattern of Hsp70 in different organs indicated that the liver, spleen, brain and kidney exhibited 5.94, 4.96, 5.29 and 2.63-fold higher expression than control. Liver and brain tissues showed the highest gene expression at mRNA levels as compared to kidney, spleen and heart. HST individuals had higher levels of mRNA level expression than HSS individuals in all breeds. The Sirohi breed showed the highest (6.3-fold) mRNA expression levels as compared to the other three breeds, indicating the better heat stress regulation activity in the breed.

Abstract: Summary
Polyamines are small, positively charged molecules derived from ornithine and synthesized through an intricately regulated enzymatic pathway. Within cells, they are abundant and play several roles in diverse processes. We find that polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Depletion of spermidine and spermine via type I interferon signaling-mediated induction of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1), a key catabolic enzyme in the polyamine pathway, restricts CHIKV and ZIKV replication. Polyamine depletion restricts these viruses in vitro and in vivo, due to impairment of viral translation and RNA replication. The restriction is released by exogenous replenishment of polyamines, further supporting a role for these molecules in virus replication. Thus, SAT1 and, more broadly, polyamine depletion restrict viral replication and suggest promising avenues for antiviral therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a member of the Picornaviridae family. Although EV-D68-associated infection was once considered rare, it has been increasing in recent years. EV-D68 infection is most frequently associated with respiratory illness. However, it has also been implicated in a polio-like neurological disorder, acute flaccid myelitis. Although sialic acid has been implicated in EV-D68 entry, the existence of a protein receptor has yet to be clarified. Here we identify neuron-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 5 (ICAM-5/telencephalin) as a cellular receptor for sialic acid-dependent and -independent EV-D68 viruses. EV-D68 bound specifically and efficiently to ICAM-5, and replication of EV-D68 in diverse cell types was inhibited by soluble ICAM-5 fragments. ICAM-5 silencing attenuated EV-D68 replication in permissive cells, and ICAM-5 expression in non-permissive cells allowed EV-D68 replication. The discovery of a neuron-specific adhesion molecule as an EV-D68 receptor has important implications for EV-D68 pathogenesis and may facilitate the development of novel intervention strategies.

Abstract: Summary
The capacity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to generate B lymphocytes declines with age, contributing to impaired immune function in the elderly. Here we show that the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 plays an important role in human B lymphoid differentiation and that expression of SUV39H1 decreases with age in both human and mouse HSC, leading to a global reduction in H3K9 trimethylation and perturbed heterochromatin function. Further, we demonstrate that SUV39H1 is a target of microRNA miR-125b, a known regulator of HSC function, and that expression of miR-125b increases with age in human HSC. Overexpression of miR-125b and inhibition of SUV39H1 in young HSC induced loss of B cell potential. Conversely, both inhibition of miR-125 and enforced expression of SUV39H1 improved the capacity of HSC from elderly individuals to generate B cells. Our findings highlight the importance of heterochromatin regulation in HSC aging and B lymphopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Coenzyme Q (Q) is a redox lipid that is central for the energetic metabolism of eukaryotes. The biosynthesis of Q from the aromatic precursor 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HB) is understood fairly well. However, biosynthetic details of how 4-HB is produced from tyrosine remain elusive. Here, we provide key insights into this long-standing biosynthetic problem by uncovering molecular details of the first and last reactions of the pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, namely the deamination of tyrosine to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate by Aro8 and Aro9, and the oxidation of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde to 4-HB by Hfd1. Inactivation of the HFD1 gene in yeast resulted in Q deficiency, which was rescued by the human enzyme ALDH3A1. This suggests that a similar pathway operates in animals, including humans, and led us to propose that patients with genetically unassigned Q deficiency should be screened for mutations in aldehyde dehydrogenase genes, especially ALDH3A1.

Abstract: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most devastating complications of sepsis lacking of effective therapy. Mitochondrial dynamics undergoing continuous fusion and fission play a crucial role in mitochondrial structure and function. Fis1, as a small protein located on the outer membrane of mitochondria, has been thought to be an important protein mediated mitochondrial fission. During ARDS, alveolar macrophages suffer from increased oxidative stress and apoptosis, and also accompanied by disrupted mitochondrial dynamics. In addition, as one of the products of heme degradation catalyzed by heme oxygenase, carbon monoxide (CO) possesses powerful protective properties in vivo or in vitro models, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptosis function. However, there is little evidence that CO alleviates oxidative stress damage through altering mitochondrial fission in alveolar macrophages. In the present study, our results showed that CO increased cell vitality, improved mitochondrial SOD activity, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inhibited cell apoptosis in NR8383 exposed to LPS. Meanwhile, CO decreased the expression of Fis1, increased mitochondrial membrane potential and sustained elongation of mitochondria in LPS-incubated NR8383. Overall, our study underscored a critical role of CO in suppressing the expression of Fis1 and alleviating LPS- induced oxidative stress damage in alveolar macrophages.

Abstract: Simple and efficient methods are presented for creating precise modifications of the zebrafish genome. Edited alleles are generated by homologous recombination between the host genome and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) donor molecules, stimulated by the induction of double-strand breaks at targeted loci in the host genome. Because several kilobase-long tracts of sequence can be exchanged, multiple genome modifications can be generated simultaneously at a single locus. Methods are described for creating: (1) alleles with simple sequence changes or in-frame additions, (2) knockin/knockout alleles that express a reporter protein from an endogenous locus, and (3) conditional alleles in which exons are flanked by recombinogenic loxP sites. Significantly, our approach to genome editing allows the incorporation of a linked reporter gene into the donor sequences so that successfully edited alleles can be identified by virtue of expression of the reporter. Factors affecting the efficiency of genome editing are discussed, including the finding that dsDNA products of I-SceI meganuclease enzyme digestion are particularly effective as donor molecules for gene-editing events. Reagents and procedures are described for accomplishing efficient genome editing in the zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
The SPI-2 type III secretion system (T3SS) of intracellular Salmonella enterica translocates effector proteins into mammalian cells. Infection of antigen-presenting cells results in SPI-2 T3SS-dependent ubiquitination and reduction of surface-localized mature MHC class II (mMHCII). We identify the effector SteD as required and sufficient for this process. In Mel Juso cells, SteD localized to the Golgi network and vesicles containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 and mMHCII. SteD caused MARCH8-dependent ubiquitination and depletion of surface mMHCII. One of two transmembrane domains and the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of SteD mediated binding to MARCH8 and mMHCII, respectively. Infection of dendritic cells resulted in SteD-dependent depletion of surface MHCII, the co-stimulatory molecule B7.2, and suppression of T cell activation. SteD also accounted for suppression of T cell activation during Salmonella infection of mice. We propose that SteD is an adaptor, forcing inappropriate ubiquitination of mMHCII by MARCH8 and thereby suppressing T cell activation.

Abstract: G9a is one of the histone H3 Lys 9 (H3K9) specific methyltransferases first identified in mammals. Drosophila G9a (dG9a) has been reported to induce H3K9 dimethylation in vivo, and the target genes of dG9a were identified during embryonic and larval stages. Although dG9a is important for a variety of developmental processes, the link between dG9a and signaling pathways are not addressed yet. Here, by genome-wide genetic screen, taking advantage of the rough eye phenotype of flies that over-express dG9a in eye discs, we identified 16 genes that enhanced the rough eye phenotype induced by dG9a over-expression. These 16 genes included Star, anterior open, bereft and F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 6 which are components of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. When dG9a over-expression was combined with mutation of Star, differentiation of R7 photoreceptors in eye imaginal discs as well as cone cells and pigment cells in pupal retinae was severely inhibited. Furthermore, the dG9a over-expression reduced the activated ERK signals in eye discs. These data demonstrate a strong genetic link between dG9a and the EGFR signaling pathway.

Abstract: The Tol2 element is an active transposon that was found from the genome of the Japanese medaka fish. Since the Tol2 transposition system is active in all vertebrate cells tested so far, it has been applied to germ line transgenesis in various model animals including fish, frog, chicken, and mouse, and to gene transfer in culture cells. In zebrafish, the Tol2 system consists of the transposase mRNA and a Tol2 transposon-donor plasmid, and is introduced into fertilized eggs by microinjection. Thus genomic integrations of the Tol2 construct are generated in the germ lineage and transmitted to the offspring very efficiently. By using the Tol2 transposition system, we have developed important genetic methods, such as transgenesis, gene trapping, enhancer trapping, and the Gal4-UAS system in zebrafish and applied to many aspects of biological studies. In this chapter, we describe how these methods are performed.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of new ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products (RiPPs) has greatly benefitted from the influx of genomic information. The lanthipeptides are a subset of this class of compounds. Adopting the genome-mining approach revealed a novel lanthipeptide gene cluster encoded in the genome of Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, an anaerobic bacterium that is an important member of the rumen microbiota of livestock. The post-translationally modified peptides were produced via heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Subsequent structural characterization and assessment of their bioactivity revealed features reminiscent of and distinct from previously reported lanthipeptides. The lanthipeptides of R. flavefaciens FD-1 represent a unique example within two-component lanthipeptides, consisting of a highly conserved α-peptide and a diverse set of eight β-peptides.

Abstract: The zebrafish has been a powerful model in forward genetic screens to identify genes essential for organogenesis and embryonic development. Conversely, using reverse genetics to investigate specific gene function requires phenotypic analysis of complete gene inactivation. Despite the availability and efficacy of morpholinos, the lack of tractable and efficient knockout technologies has impeded reverse genetic studies in the zebrafish, particularly in adult animals. The recent development of genome-editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 greatly widened the scope of loss-of-function studies in the zebrafish, allowing for the rapid phenotypic assessment of gene silencing in embryos, the generation of knockout lines, and large-scale reverse genetic screens. Tissue-specific gene inactivation would be ideal for these studies given the caveats of whole-embryo gene silencing, yet spatial control of gene targeting remains a challenge. In this chapter, we focus on tissue-specific gene inactivation using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We first explain the rationale for this technique, including some of its potential applications to tackle important biological issues and the inability of current technologies to address these issues. We then present a method to target genes in a tissue-specific manner in the zebrafish. Finally, we discuss technical difficulties and limitations of this method as well as possible future developments.

Abstract: X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is required for dosage compensation of X-linked genes in human female cells. Several previous reports have described the promiscuous XCI status in long-term cultured female human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and the majority of them exhibit non-random XCI. However, when and how such female hESCs acquire the aberrant XCI states during culture is unknown. Herein, through comparing the XCI states in 18 paired hES cell lines throughout early culture, we revealed a uniform dynamic change during this culture period under a widely used culture condition. The female initial hESCs (ihESCs, P4-P9) expressed XIST RNA, H3K27me3 punctate enrichment and displayed random XCI pattern. By further culturing, the female early hESCs (ehESCs, P20–P30) lost the expression of XIST RNA, H3K27me3 punctate enrichment and exhibited a completely skewed XCI pattern. Importantly, a subset of X-linked genes was up-regulated in ehESCs, including some cancer-related genes. At last, we found 5% physiological oxygen was beneficial for the expression of XIST and H3K27me3 punctate enrichment, but not for the XCI pattern. We conclude that the XCI dynamic change is a frequent epigenetic instability event during early culture, which is accompanied by the up-regulation of some X-linked genes. Furthermore, we emphasize that physiological oxygen is beneficial for XCI fidelity.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are cellular repair agents that counter the effects of protein misfolding that is a characteristic feature of neurodegenerative diseases. HSPA1A (Hsp70–1) is a widely studied member of the HSPA (Hsp70) family. The little-studied HSPA6 (Hsp70B’) is present in the human genome and absent in mouse and rat; hence, it is missing in current animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Differentiated human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells were employed to compare the dynamics of the association of YFP-tagged HSPA6 and HSPA1A with stress-sensitive cytoplasmic and nuclear structures. Following thermal stress, live-imaging confocal microscopy and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) demonstrated that HSPA6 displayed a prolonged and more dynamic association, compared to HSPA1A, with centrioles that play critical roles in neuronal polarity and migration. HSPA6 and HSPA1A also targeted nuclear speckles, rich in RNA splicing factors, and the granular component of the nucleolus that is involved in rRNA processing and ribosomal subunit assembly. HSPA6 and HSPA1A displayed similar FRAP kinetics in their interaction with nuclear speckles and the nucleolus. Subsequently, during the recovery from neuronal stress, HSPA6, but not HSPA1A, localized with the periphery of nuclear speckles (perispeckles) that have been characterized as transcription sites. The stress-induced association of HSPA6 with perispeckles displayed the greatest dynamism compared to the interaction of HSPA6 or HSPA1A with other stress-sensitive cytoplasmic and nuclear structures. This suggests involvement of HSPA6 in transcriptional recovery of human neurons from cellular stress that is not apparent for HSPA1A.

Abstract: DNA damage response is crucially involved in cellular senescence. We have previously shown that excess thymidine, which stalls DNA replication forks, induces cellular senescence in human cells, and ERK1/2 play a key role in the induction of it. In this study, we found that Chk1 and ERK1/2 were activated to promote cell survival upon addition of excess thymidine. Knockdown of ERK1/2 activated Chk1, and conversely, knockdown of Chk1 activated ERK1/2, which observations suggested a mechanism for compensatory activation of Chk1 and ERK1/2 in the absence of ERK1/2 and Chk1, respectively. We also found that Chk1 functioned mainly at the onset of cellular senescence, and on the other hand, ERK1/2 functioned for a more extended period to induce cellular senescence. Our findings suggested that Chk1 and ERK1/2 were activated to promote cell survival upon addition of excess thymidine, but prolonged activation of ERK1/2 led to cellular senescence. This implies a pleiotropic effect of ERK1/2 in cellular senescence induced by excess thymidine.

Abstract: Neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the adult mammalian brain demonstrate potential in applications of neural repair in the CNS. Recent work has shown that cyclosporin A (CsA), a commonly used immunosuppressive drug, expands the size of the NPC pool in the subventricular region by promoting cell survival. We asked if CsA had similar effects on NPCs in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, leading to increased neurogenesis. We used the in vitro and in vivo assays to examine CsA's effect on the size of the NPC pool and the proliferation and differentiation profile of cells within the DG. We found that CsA increases the numbers of NPCs and enriches for neurogenic NPCs in vitro. Similarly, in vivo systemic administration of CsA for 7days increases the size of the NPC pool in the DG observed through increases in numbers of proliferating cells and newborn neurons. Consistent with CsA's pro-survival effects, we have shown that CsA enhances the survival of newborn cells that normally undergo cell death over the time of infusion. Together these findings support the hypothesis that CsA administration promotes neurogenesis and may have implications for neural repair.

Abstract: Apoptosis, as an innate antiviral defense, not only functions to limit viral replication by eliminating infected cells, but also contribute to viral dissemination, particularly at the late stages of infection. A highly neurotropic CVS strain of rabies virus induces apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. However, the detailed mechanism of CVS-mediated neuronal apoptosis is not entirely clear. Here, we show that CVS induces apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway by dissipating mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and AIF. CVS blocks Bax activation at the early stages of infection; while M protein partially targets mitochondria and induces mitochondrial apoptosis at the late stages of infection. The α-helix structure spanning 67–79 amino acids of M protein is essential for mitochondrial targeting and induction of apoptosis. These results suggest that CVS functions on mitochondria to regulate apoptosis at different stages of infection, so as to for viral replication and dissemination.

Abstract: It has been suggested that continuous exposure of peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs) to high glucose-containing peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions may result in peritoneal inflammatory injury and impairment of local peritoneal host defence. Here, we investigated the effect of glucose-based PD solutions on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nod-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in human PMCs (HPMCs). Exposure of HPMCs to high glucose-based PD solutions resulted in ROS production, which can trigger NLRP3 activation, leading to IL-1β secretion. Additionally, resveratrol (RSV) treatment induced mitophagy/autophagy via adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased mitochondrial ROS concentrations and IL-1β upregulation were confirmed following inhibition (siRNA against Beclin1 and ATG5 or autophagy inhibitor 3MA), but not induction (RSV), of mitophagy/autophagy. Furthermore, we observed that ATG5 and Beclin1 downregulation sensitised cells to IL-1β release induced by MSU or nigericin, which is an NLRP3 inflammasome activator. RSV treatment attenuated this effect. Taken together, this study may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for peritoneal inflammatory injury via NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggered by mitochondrial ROS.

Abstract: Summary
Reports on the retention of somatic cell memory in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have complicated the selection of the optimal cell type for the generation of iPSC biobanks. To address this issue we compared transcriptomic, epigenetic, and differentiation propensities of genetically matched human iPSCs derived from fibroblasts and blood, two tissues of the most practical relevance for biobanking. Our results show that iPSC lines derived from the same donor are highly similar to each other. However, genetic variation imparts a donor-specific expression and methylation profile in reprogrammed cells that leads to variable functional capacities of iPSC lines. Our results suggest that integration-free, bona fide iPSC lines from fibroblasts and blood can be combined in repositories to form biobanks. Due to the impact of genetic variation on iPSC differentiation, biobanks should contain cells from large numbers of donors.

Abstract: Summary
Apicomplexa exhibit a unique form of substrate-dependent gliding motility central for host cell invasion and parasite dissemination. Gliding is powered by rearward translocation of apically secreted transmembrane adhesins via their interaction with the parasite actomyosin system. We report a conserved armadillo and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing protein, termed glideosome-associated connector (GAC), that mediates apicomplexan gliding motility, invasion, and egress by connecting the micronemal adhesins with the actomyosin system. TgGAC binds to and stabilizes filamentous actin and specifically associates with the transmembrane adhesin TgMIC2. GAC localizes to the apical pole in invasive stages of Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium berghei, and apical positioning of TgGAC depends on an apical lysine methyltransferase, TgAKMT. GAC PH domain also binds to phosphatidic acid, a lipid mediator associated with microneme exocytosis. Collectively, these findings indicate a central role for GAC in spatially and temporally coordinating gliding motility and invasion.

Abstract: Diabetic cardiomyopathy increases the risk for the development of heart failure independent of coronary artery disease and hypertension. Either type 1 or type 2 diabetes is often accompanied by varying degrees of hyperglycemia, which has been proven to induce myocardial apoptosis in animal models. Recently, a novel small molecule, ZLN005, has been reported to show antidiabetic efficacy in a mouse model, possibly by induction of PGC-1α expression. In this study, we investigated whether ZLN005 protects cardiomyocytes against high glucose-induced cytotoxicity and the mechanisms involved. Neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were incubated with media containing 5.5 or 33mM glucose for 24h in the presence or absence of ZLN005. ZLN005 treatment led to ameliorated cardiomyocyte oxidative injury, enhanced cell viability, and reduced apoptosis in the high glucose environment. Western blot analysis revealed that high glucose suppressed cardiomyocyte autophagy, whereas ZLN005 increased the expression of autophagy marker proteins ATG5, beclin1, and LC3 II/LC3 I; this increase was accompanied by increased expression of SIRT1. Furthermore, EX527, a SIRT1-specific inhibitor, weakened the protective effects of ZLN005 on cardiomyocytes subjected to high glucose. Taken together, these results suggest that ZLN005 suppresses high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte injury by promoting SIRT1 expression and autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
The intracellular bacterial pathogen Francisella tularensis causes tularemia, a zoonosis that can be fatal. The type VI secretion system (T6SS) encoded by the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI) is critical for the virulence of this organism. Existing studies suggest that the complete repertoire of T6SS effectors delivered to host cells is encoded by the FPI. Using a proteome-wide approach, we discovered that the FPI-encoded T6SS exports at least three effectors encoded outside of the island. These proteins share features with virulence determinants of other pathogens, and we provide evidence that they can contribute to intramacrophage growth. The remaining proteins that we identified are encoded within the FPI. Two of these FPI-encoded proteins constitute effectors, whereas the others form a unique complex required for core function of the T6SS apparatus. The discovery of secreted effectors mediating interactions between Francisella and its host significantly advances our understanding of the pathogenesis of this organism.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogen invasion is often accompanied by widespread alterations in cellular physiology, which reflects the hijacking of host factors and processes for pathogen entry and replication. Although genetic perturbation screens have revealed the complexity of host factors involved for numerous pathogens, it has remained challenging to temporally define the progression of events in host cell reorganization during infection. We combine high-confidence genome-scale RNAi screening of host factors required for rotavirus infection in human intestinal cells with an innovative approach to infer the trajectory of virus infection from fixed cell populations. This approach reveals a comprehensive network of host cellular processes involved in rotavirus infection and implicates AMPK in initiating the development of a rotavirus-permissive environment. Our work provides a powerful approach that can be generalized to order complex host cellular requirements along a trajectory of cellular reorganization during pathogen invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a leading cause of genital herpes, infects oral or genital mucosal epithelial cells before infecting the peripheral sensory nervous system. The spread of HSV-1 beyond the sensory nervous system and the resulting broader spectrum of disease are not well understood. Using a mouse model of genital herpes, we found that HSV-1-infection-associated lethality correlated with severe fecal and urinary retention. No inflammation or infection of the brain was evident. Instead, HSV-1 spread via the dorsal root ganglia to the autonomic ganglia of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in the colon. ENS infection led to robust viral gene transcription, pathological inflammatory responses, and neutrophil-mediated destruction of enteric neurons, ultimately resulting in permanent loss of peristalsis and the development of toxic megacolon. Laxative treatment rescued mice from lethality following genital HSV-1 infection. These results reveal an unexpected pathogenesis of HSV associated with ENS infection.

Abstract: Inflammation is a common situation during bone healing and is recognized to inhibit osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. However, the effect of inflammation on BMP-9-induced osteoblastic differentiation remains unclear. In the present study, we found that an inflammatory environment triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro suppressed BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation. In addition, LPS decreased BMP-9-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and showed obvious inhibitory effects on BMP-9-induced Smad signaling. We then confirmed that LPS and BMP-9 can activate p38MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling, and that LPS stimulation reduces BMP-9-induced Runx2 expression through the activation of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling. Finally, we determined that blockade of MAPK signaling by specific inhibitors reverses the inhibitory effect of LPS on BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation, and that MAPK acts as a mediator of the negative regulatory role of LPS in BMP-9-induced activation of Smad signaling. Based on these results, we conclude that the LPS-mediated inflammatory environment inhibits BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation, via crosstalk between BMP/MAPK and Smad signaling. The elucidation of these mechanisms may hasten the development of new strategies and improve the osteoinductive efficacy of BMP-9 in the clinic, resulting in enhanced osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation.

Abstract: Summary
Trypanosoma brucei is an extracellular parasite that causes sleeping sickness. In mammalian hosts, trypanosomes are thought to exist in two major niches: early in infection, they populate the blood; later, they breach the blood-brain barrier. Working with a well-established mouse model, we discovered that adipose tissue constitutes a third major reservoir for T. brucei. Parasites from adipose tissue, here termed adipose tissue forms (ATFs), can replicate and were capable of infecting a naive animal. ATFs were transcriptionally distinct from bloodstream forms, and the genes upregulated included putative fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes. Consistent with this, ATFs were able to utilize exogenous myristate and form β-oxidation intermediates, suggesting that ATF parasites can use fatty acids as an external carbon source. These findings identify the adipose tissue as a niche for T. brucei during its mammalian life cycle and could potentially explain the weight loss associated with sleeping sickness.

Abstract: Summary
Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was impaired in several Alzheimer's disease models overexpressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP). However, the effects of wild-type hAPP on adult neurogenesis and whether the impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis was caused by amyloid β (Aβ) or APP remained unclear. Here, we found that neurogenesis was impaired in the dentate gyrus (DG) of adult mice overexpressing wild-type hAPP (hAPP-I5) compared with controls. However, the adult hippocampal neurogenesis was more severely impaired in hAPP-I5 than that in hAPP-J20 mice, which express similar levels of hAPP mRNA but much higher levels of Aβ. Furthermore, reducing Aβ levels did not affect the number of doublecortin-positive cells in the DG of hAPP-J20 mice. Our results suggested that hAPP was more likely an important factor inhibiting adult neurogenesis, and Aβ was not the major factor affecting neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus of hAPP mice.

Abstract: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) represent a heterogeneous cell population that is believed to be involved in vasculogenesis. With the purpose of enhancing endothelial repair, EPCs could have a potential for future cell therapies. Due to the low amount of EPCs in the peripheral circulating blood, in vitro expansion is needed before administration to recipients and the effects of in vitro culturing is still an under-evaluated field with little knowledge of how the cells change over time in culture. The aim of this study was to use hyperpolarised carbon-13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy to profile important metabolic pathways in a population of progenitor cells and to show that cell culturing in 3D scaffolds seem to block the metabolic processes that leads to cell senescence. The metabolic breakdown of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate was followed after injection of the substrate to a bioreactor system with EPCs either adhered to 3D printed scaffolds or kept in cell suspension. The pyruvate-to-lactate conversion was elevated in suspension of EPCs compared to the EPCs adhered to scaffolds. Furthermore in the setup with EPCs in suspension, an increase in lactate production was seen over time indicating that the older the cultures of EPCs was before using the cells for cell suspension experiments, the more lactate they produce, compared to a constant lactate level in the cells adhered to scaffolds. It could therefore be stated that cells grown first in 2D culture and subsequent prepared for cell suspension show a metabolism with higher lactate production consistent with cells senescence processes compared to cells grown first at 2D culture and subsequent in the 3D printed scaffolds, where metabolism shows no sign of metabolic shifting during the monitored period.

Abstract: Generating human podocytes in vitro could offer a unique opportunity to study human diseases. Here, we describe a simple and efficient protocol for obtaining functional podocytes in vitro from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Cells were exposed to a three-step protocol, which induced their differentiation into intermediate mesoderm, then into nephron progenitors and, finally, into mature podocytes. After differentiation, cells expressed the main podocyte markers, such as synaptopodin, WT1, α-Actinin-4, P-cadherin and nephrin at the protein and mRNA level, and showed the low proliferation rate typical of mature podocytes. Exposure to Angiotensin II significantly decreased the expression of podocyte genes and cells underwent cytoskeleton rearrangement. Cells were able to internalize albumin and self-assembled into chimeric 3D structures in combination with dissociated embryonic mouse kidney cells. Overall, these findings demonstrate the establishment of a robust protocol that, mimicking developmental stages, makes it possible to derive functional podocytes in vitro.

Abstract: Characterization and identification of cancer cell, chemotherapy, resistance is important for both routine cancer therapy and trouble-shooting the medication treatment regimen. Present techniques for characterizing cancer cell resistance require multiple methods and steps, which are time-consuming and expensive. We present a protocol for simple sample handling, rapid detection, and spectral characterization of early resistant hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells, using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR). Studies on alteration of the biochemical properties in a resistant HepG2 cell were evaluated—viz., increase efflux proteins (MRP-1 and P-gp) activity, total GSH content, anti-apoptotic (Bcl2) expression, and reduction of pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins. Principle component analysis (PCA) was used to discriminate resistant HepG2 cells from parental HepG2 cells. Three important FTIR spectral regions were evaluated for reproducibility and discrimination ability—viz., lipid (3000–2800cm−1), protein (1700–1500cm−1) and carbohydrate and nucleic acid (1300–900cm−1). These 3 spectral regions can be used as spectroscopic biomarkers for differentiation of early or low resistance. This work presents a novel concept for high-throughput, FTIR spectroscopic discrimination of early resistance; thus enabling identification and characterization of cancer cell resistance.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of human cells and tissues holds much promise to advance medicine and biology, but standard editing methods require weeks to months of reagent preparation and selection where much or all of the initial edited samples are destroyed during analysis. ArrayEdit, a simple approach utilizing surface-modified multiwell plates containing one-pot transcribed single-guide RNAs, separates thousands of edited cell populations for automated, live, high-content imaging and analysis. The approach lowers the time and cost of gene editing and produces edited human embryonic stem cells at high efficiencies. Edited genes can be expressed in both pluripotent stem cells and differentiated cells. This preclinical platform adds important capabilities to observe editing and selection in situ within complex structures generated by human cells, ultimately enabling optical and other molecular perturbations in the editing workflow that could refine the specificity and versatility of gene editing.

Heat stress promotes the down-regulation of IRE1α in cells: An atypical modulation of the UPR pathway,

Abstract: Heat stress induces intracellular protein denaturation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which elicits unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells. UPR involves three ER-localized sensor proteins: the inositol-requiring protein 1α (IRE1α), the dsRNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6). However, the precise mechanism by which cells deal with heat stress remains to be elucidated. We report herein that heat stress effectively activates all branches of the UPR. While splicing of the XBP-1 mRNA is usually triggered by activated IRE1α, the level of this protein was found to be decreased immediately after the occurrence of heat stress and the down-regulation gradually recovered thereafter. The protein levels of other UPR sensors or ER luminal proteins were unaffected. The down-regulation of IRE1α was independent of cellular viability. It thus appears that the heat-stress induced down-regulation of the IRE1α protein may lead to the termination of the IRE1α signaling pathway in an attempt to avoid excessive responses. We investigated the machinery causing IRE1α down-regulation and found that heat stress effectively promoted the activation of autophagy. Importantly, the inhibition of either proteasomes or autophagic flux failed to rescue the loss of IRE1α following heat stress. These collective results suggest that heat stress simultaneously activates both the UPR and autophagy, followed by the activation of a negative feedback system in UPR by modulating the responses related to the IRE1α–XBP-1 axis.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a series of pathological events that can have profound influences on motor, sensory and cognitive functions. Conversely, TBI can also stimulate neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation leading to increased numbers of neuroblasts migrating outside their restrictive neurogenic zone to areas of damage in support of tissue integrity. Unfortunately, the factors that regulate migration are poorly understood. Here, we examine whether ephrinB3 functions to restrict neuroblasts from migrating outside the subventricular zone (SVZ) and rostral migratory stream (RMS). We have previously shown that ephrinB3 is expressed in tissues surrounding these regions, including the overlying corpus callosum (CC), and is reduced after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Our current study takes advantage of ephrinB3 knockout mice to examine the influences of ephrinB3 on neuroblast migration into CC and cortex tissues after CCI injury. Both injury and/or ephrinB3 deficiency led to increased neuroblast numbers and enhanced migration outside the SVZ/RMS zones. Application of soluble ephrinB3-Fc molecules reduced neuroblast migration into the CC after injury and limited neuroblast chain migration in cultured SVZ explants. Our findings suggest that ephrinB3 expression in tissues surrounding neurogenic regions functions to restrict neuroblast migration outside the RMS by limiting chain migration.

Abstract: Danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are activated by endogenous signals that originate from stressed, injured, or necrotic cells, signifying “danger” to the host. In this study, we evaluated the expression of the DAMP heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in trauma patients with and without secondary infections. Levels of glucose (GLU), procalcitonin (PCT), total cholesterol (T-Chol), and white blood cell (WBC) counts were also evaluated at three time stages after trauma. Our analysis showed that the levels of serum HSP70 in patients with minor, moderate, and severe injuries were significantly higher than in healthy patients at each time point post-injury (P < 0.01), and levels of serum HSP70 in the severe injury group were significantly higher than in the minor injury group at 1–6 h after trauma (P = 0.047). HSP70 was correlated with GLU and was negatively correlated with T-Chol in the period 1–6 h after injury (P = 0.008/0.032). WBC and GLU were elevated after trauma, with mutual positive correlation (P < 0.001). PCT levels increased later than WBC counts and GLU levels; these levels were correlated at the two later time periods, 24–48 h and 60–90 h (P = 0.008/0.041). PCT continued to rise in patients with secondary infection, but PCT dropped at the third time period in patients without secondary infection. In summary, our results suggest that danger and stress theory can be used to predict severity of trauma.

Metabolic alterations in bladder cancer: applications for cancer imaging,

Abstract: Treatment planning, outcome and prognosis are strongly related to the adequate tumor staging for bladder cancer (BC). Unfortunately, a large discrepancy exists between the preoperative clinical and final pathologic staging. Therefore, an advanced imaging-based technique is crucial for adequate staging. Although Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is currently the best in vivo imaging technique for BC staging because of its excellent soft-tissue contrast and absence of ionizing radiation it lacks cancer-specificity. Tumor-specific positron emission tomography (PET), which is based on the Warburg effect (preferential uptake of glucose by cancer cells), exploits the radioactively–labeled glucose analogs, i.e., FDG. Although FDG-PET is highly cancer specific, it lacks resolution and contrast quality comparable with MRI. Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI enables the detection of low concentrations of metabolites containing protons. BC is an attractive target for glucose CEST MRI because, in addition to the typical systemic administration, glucose might also be directly applied into the bladder to reduce toxicity-related complications. As a first stage of the development of a contrast-specific BC imaging technique we have studied glucose uptake by bladder epithelial cells and have observed that glucose is, indeed, consumed by BC cells with higher intensity than by non-transformed urothelial cells. This effect might be partly explained by increased expression of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3 in transformed cells as compared to normal urothelium. We also detected higher lactate production by BC cells which is another cancer-specific manifestation of the Warburg effect. In addition, we have observed other metabolic alterations in BC cells as compared to non-transformed cells: in particular, increased pyruvate synthesis. When glucose was substituted by glutamine in culture media, preferential uptake of glutamine by BC cells was observed. The preferential uptake of glucose by BC cells gives an opportunity to develop NMR based imaging procedures where glucose or its derivatives can serve as a contrasting agent. In addition, metabolic alterations observed in BC cells could provide the basis for development of new anti-cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic changes in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) gained during culture can confound experimental results and potentially jeopardize the outcome of clinical therapies. Particularly common changes in hPSCs are trisomies of chromosomes 1, 12, 17, and 20. Thus, hPSCs should be regularly screened for such aberrations. Although a number of methods are used to assess hPSC genotypes, there has been no systematic evaluation of the sensitivity of the commonly used techniques in detecting low-level mosaicism in hPSC cultures. We have performed mixing experiments to mimic the naturally occurring mosaicism and have assessed the sensitivity of chromosome banding, qPCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and digital droplet PCR in detecting variants. Our analysis highlights the limits of mosaicism detection by the commonly employed methods, a pivotal requirement for interpreting the genetic status of hPSCs and for setting standards for safe applications of hPSCs in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Enterococcus faecalis is frequently associated with polymicrobial infections of the urinary tract, indwelling catheters, and surgical wound sites. E. faecalis co-exists with Escherichia coli and other pathogens in wound infections, but mechanisms that govern polymicrobial colonization and pathogenesis are poorly defined. During infection, bacteria must overcome multiple host defenses, including nutrient iron limitation, to persist and cause disease. In this study, we investigated the contribution of E. faecalis to mixed-species infection when iron availability is restricted. We show that E. faecalis significantly augments E. coli biofilm growth and survival in vitro and in vivo by exporting L-ornithine. This metabolic cue facilitates E. coli biosynthesis of the enterobactin siderophore, allowing E. coli growth and biofilm formation in iron-limiting conditions that would otherwise restrict its growth. Thus, E. faecalis modulates its local environment by contributing growth-promoting cues that allow co-infecting organisms to overcome iron limitation and promotes polymicrobial infections.

Abstract: Summary
Naive mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are in a metastable state and fluctuate between inner cell mass- and epiblast-like phenotypes. Here, we show transient activation of the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway in mESCs containing a BMP-SMAD responsive reporter transgene. Activation of the BMP-SMAD reporter transgene in naive mESCs correlated with lower levels of genomic DNA methylation, high expression of 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases Tet1/2 and low levels of DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a/b. Moreover, naive mESCs, in which the BMP-SMAD reporter transgene was activated, showed higher resistance to differentiation. Using double Smad1;Smad5 knockout mESCs, we showed that BMP-SMAD signaling is dispensable for self-renewal in both naive and ground state. These mutant mESCs were still pluripotent, but they exhibited higher levels of DNA methylation than their wild-type counterparts and had a higher propensity to differentiate. We showed that BMP-SMAD signaling modulates lineage priming in mESCs, by transiently regulating the enzymatic machinery responsible for DNA methylation.

Abstract: Summary
Legumain (AEP) is a lysosomal cysteine protease that was first characterized in leguminous seeds and later discovered in higher eukaryotes. AEP upregulation is linked to a number of diseases including inflammation, arteriosclerosis, and tumorigenesis. Thus this protease is an excellent molecular target for the development of new chemical markers. We deployed a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) approach to obtain P1-Asp fluorogenic substrates and biotin-labeled inhibitors that targeted legumain. Since this approach led to probes that were also recognized by caspases, we introduced a Counter Selection Substrate Library (CoSeSuL) approach that biases the peptidic scaffold against caspases, thus delivering highly selective legumain probes. The selectivity of these tools was validated using M38L and HEK293 cells. We also propose that the CoSeSuL methodology can be considered as a general principle in the design of selective probes for other protease families where selectivity is difficult to achieve by conventional sequence-based profiling.

Abstract: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer with a continuously growing incidence worldwide and is usually resistant to chemotherapy agents, which is due in part to a strong resistance to apoptosis. Previously, we had showed that B16-F0 murine melanoma cells undergoing apoptosis are able to delay their own death induced by ursolic acid (UA), a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid compound. We had demonstrated that tyrosinase and TRP-1 up-regulation in apoptotic cells and the subsequent production of melanin were implicated in an apoptosis resistance mechanism. Several resistance mechanisms to apoptosis have been characterized in melanoma such as hyperactivation of DNA repair mechanisms, drug efflux systems, and reinforcement of survival signals (PI3K/Akt, NF-κB and Raf/MAPK pathways). Otherwise, other mechanisms of apoptosis resistance involving different proteins, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), have been described in many cancer types. By using a strategy of specific inhibition of each ways, we suggested that there was an interaction between melanogenesis and COX-2/PGE2 pathway. This was characterized by analyzing the COX-2 expression and activity, the expression of tyrosinase and melanin production. Furthermore, we showed that anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects of UA were mediated through modulation of multiple signaling pathways including Akt and ERK-1/2 proteins. Our study not only uncovers underlying molecular mechanisms of UA action in human melanoma cancer cells but also suggest its great potential as an adjuvant in treatment and cancer prevention.

Abstract: Cell migration plays a key role in many biological processes, including cancer growth and invasion, embryogenesis, angiogenesis, inflammatory response, and tissue repair. In this work, we compare two well-established experimental approaches for the investigation of cell motility in vitro: the cell random migration (CRM) and the wound healing (WH) assay. In the former, extensive tracking of individual live cells trajectories by time-lapse microscopy and elaborate data processing are used to calculate two intrinsic motility parameters of the cell population under investigation, i.e. the diffusion coefficient and the persistence time. In the WH assay, a scratch is made in a confluent cell monolayer and the closure time of the exposed area is taken as an easy-to-measure, empirical estimate of cell migration. To compare WH and CRM we applied the two assays to investigate the motility of skin fibroblasts isolated from wild type and transgenic mice (TgPED) overexpressing the protein PED/PEA-15, which is highly expressed in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our main result is that the cell motility parameters derived from CRM can be also estimated from a time-resolved analysis of the WH assay, thus showing that the latter is also amenable to a quantitative analysis for the characterization of cell migration. To our knowledge this is the first quantitative comparison of these two widely used techniques.

Abstract: Summary
A population of CD4 T lymphocytes harboring latent HIV genomes can persist in patients on antiretroviral therapy, posing a barrier to HIV eradication. To examine cellular complexes controlling HIV latency, we conducted a genome-wide screen with a pooled ultracomplex shRNA library and in vitro system modeling HIV latency and identified the mTOR complex as a modulator of HIV latency. Knockdown of mTOR complex subunits or pharmacological inhibition of mTOR activity suppresses reversal of latency in various HIV-1 latency models and HIV-infected patient cells. mTOR inhibitors suppress HIV transcription both through the viral transactivator Tat and via Tat-independent mechanisms. This inhibition occurs at least in part via blocking the phosphorylation of CDK9, a p-TEFb complex member that serves as a cofactor for Tat-mediated transcription. The control of HIV latency by mTOR signaling identifies a pathway that may have significant therapeutic opportunities.

Abstract: The molecular mechanisms underlying cardiogenesis are of critical biomedical importance due to the high prevalence of cardiac birth defects. Over the past two decades, the zebrafish has served as a powerful model organism for investigating heart development, facilitated by its powerful combination of optical access to the embryonic heart and plentiful opportunities for genetic analysis. Work in zebrafish has identified numerous factors that are required for various aspects of heart formation, including the specification and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells, the morphogenesis of the heart tube, cardiac chambers, and atrioventricular canal, and the establishment of proper cardiac function. However, our current roster of regulators of cardiogenesis is by no means complete. It is therefore valuable for ongoing studies to continue pursuit of additional genes and pathways that control the size, shape, and function of the zebrafish heart. An extensive arsenal of techniques is available to distinguish whether particular mutations, morpholinos, or small molecules disrupt specific processes during heart development. In this chapter, we provide a guide to the experimental strategies that are especially effective for the characterization of cardiac phenotypes in the zebrafish embryo.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important regulators of human physiology and therefore the targets of a large number of modern therapeutics. Although GPCRs are important regulators of adipose tissue endocrine and energy storage functions, the expression and function of a majority of GPCRs in adipose tissue is poorly characterized. A first step in the functional characterization of adipose tissue GPCRs is to accurately quantify the expression of GPCRs in adipose tissue. In this methods chapter, a detailed, step-by-step protocol is presented for the isolation of adipose tissue total RNA, its conversion into cDNA and the real-time PCR quantification of human GPCR mRNA expression relative to the mRNA expression of the stable adipose tissue housekeeping gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA). A comprehensive list of 377 manually validated, commercially available GPCR qPCR primers allows facilitated swift quantification of either the entire human GPCRome or individual GPCRs, thus providing a sensitive, flexible, and cost-effective means of determining the mRNA expression of GPCRs in adipose tissue.

Abstract: The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an important animal model to study cell biology in vivo. Benefits of the zebrafish include a fully annotated reference genome, an easily manipulable genome (for example, by morpholino oligonucleotide or CRISPR-Cas9), and transparent embryos for noninvasive, real-time microscopy using fluorescent transgenic lines. Zebrafish have orthologues of most human septins, and studies using larvae were used to investigate the role of septins in vertebrate development. The zebrafish larva is also an established model to study the cell biology of infection and has recently been used to visualize septin assembly during bacterial infection in vivo. Here, we describe protocols for the study of septins in zebrafish, with emphasis on techniques used to investigate the role of septins in host defense against bacterial infection.

Abstract: Forward genetics remains an important approach for the unbiased identification of factors involved in biological pathways. Forward genetic analysis in the zebrafish has until now largely been restricted to the developmental period from zygotic genome activation through the end of embryogenesis. However, the use of the zebrafish as a model system for the analysis of late larval, juvenile and adult traits, including fertility and maternal and paternal effects, continues to gain momentum. Here, we describe two approaches, based on an F3-extended family and gynogenetic methods, that allow genetic screening for, and recovery of mutations affecting post-embryonic stages, including adult traits, fertility, and parental effects. For each approach, we also describe strategies to maintain, map, and molecularly clone the identified mutations.

Abstract: Over-expression of the early neural inducer, Noggin, in nestin positive subventricular zone (SVZ), neural stem cells (NSC) promotes proliferation and neuronal differentiation of neural progenitors and inhibits the expression of a CNS-enriched microRNA-410 (miR-410) (Morell et al., 2015). When expressed in neurospheres derived from the adult SVZ, miR-410 inhibits neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation, and promotes astrocyte differentiation. miR-410 also reverses the increase in neuronal differentiation and decreased astroglial differentiation caused by Noggin over-expression. Conversely, inhibition of miR-410 activity promotes neuronal and decreases astroglial differentiation of NSC. Using computer prediction algorithms and luciferase reporter assays we identified multiple neurogenic genes including Elavl4 as downstream targets of miR-410 via the canonical miRNA-3′UTR interaction. Over-expression of Elavl4 transcripts without the endogenous 3′UTR rescued the decrease in neuronal differentiation caused by miR-410 overexpression. Interestingly, we also observed that miR-410 affected neurite morphology; over-expression of miR-410 resulted in the formation of short, unbranched neurites. We conclude that miR-410 expression provides a new link between BMP signaling and the crucial lineage choice of adult neural stem cells via its ability to bind and control the expression of neurogenic gene transcripts.

Abstract: Summary
Currently there are no approved vaccines or specific therapies to prevent or treat Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. We interrogated a library of FDA-approved drugs for their ability to block infection of human HuH-7 cells by a newly isolated ZIKV strain (ZIKV MEX_I_7). More than 20 out of 774 tested compounds decreased ZIKV infection in our in vitro screening assay. Selected compounds were further validated for inhibition of ZIKV infection in human cervical, placental, and neural stem cell lines, as well as primary human amnion cells. Established anti-flaviviral drugs (e.g., bortezomib and mycophenolic acid) and others that had no previously known antiviral activity (e.g., daptomycin) were identified as inhibitors of ZIKV infection. Several drugs reduced ZIKV infection across multiple cell types. This study identifies drugs that could be tested in clinical studies of ZIKV infection and provides a resource of small molecules to study ZIKV pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza viruses continue to represent a public health concern, and several candidate vaccines are currently being developed. It is vital to assess if protective antibodies are induced following vaccination and to characterize the diversity of epitopes targeted. Here we characterized the binding and functional properties of twelve H7-reactive human antibodies induced by a candidate A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) vaccine. Both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies protected mice in vivo during passive transfer challenge experiments. Mapping the H7 hemagglutinin antigenic sites by generating escape mutant variants against the neutralizing antibodies identified unique epitopes on the head and stalk domains. Further, the broadly cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies generated in this study were protective through Fc-mediated effector cell recruitment. These findings reveal important properties of vaccine-induced antibodies and provide a better understanding of the human monoclonal antibody response to influenza in the context of vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Energy coupling factor (ECF) transporters are responsible for the uptake of essential scarce nutrients in prokaryotes. This ATP-binding cassette transporter family comprises two subgroups that share a common architecture forming a tripartite membrane protein complex consisting of a translocation component and ATP hydrolyzing module and a substrate-capture (S) component. Here, we present the crystal structure of YkoE from Bacillus subtilis, the S component of the previously uncharacterized group I ECF transporter YkoEDC. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed the constituent residues of the thiamine-binding pocket as well as an unexpected mode of vitamin recognition. In addition, our experimental and bioinformatics data demonstrate major differences between YkoE and group II ECF transporters and indicate how group I vitamin transporter S components have diverged from other group I and group II ECF transporters.

Abstract: Summary
Live bacteria (such as probiotics) have long been used to modulate gut microbiota and human physiology, but their colonization is mostly transient. Conceptual understanding of the ecological principles as they apply to exogenously introduced microbes in gut ecosystems is lacking. We find that, when orally administered to humans, Bifidobacterium longum AH1206 stably persists in the gut of 30% of individuals for at least 6 months without causing gastrointestinal symptoms or impacting the composition of the resident gut microbiota. AH1206 engraftment was associated with low abundance of resident B. longum and underrepresentation of specific carbohydrate utilization genes in the pre-treatment microbiome. Thus, phylogenetic limiting and resource availability are two factors that control the niche opportunity for AH1206 colonization. These findings suggest that bacterial species and functional genes absent in the gut microbiome of individual humans can be reestablished, providing opportunities for precise and personalized microbiome reconstitution.

Abstract: Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) involves ectopic calcification of the spinal ligament preferentially at the cervical spine. OPLL is associated with different diseases and occurs by endochondral ossification, which is associated with the activity of different transcription factors. However, the pathogenesis of OPLL remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of osterix (Osx), a transcription factor that functions downstream of Runx2 and is an important regulator of osteogenesis, in the process of OPLL in a dexamethasone (Dex)-induced model of spinal ligament ossification. Our results showed that Osx is upregulated in patients with OPLL and during the ossification of ligament cells in parallel with the upregulation of osteogenic markers including osteocalcin (OCN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and collagen-1 (Col-1). Dex-induced ossification of ligament cells was associated with the downregulation and inactivation of β-catenin, and these effects were offset by Osx knockdown. Activation of β-catenin signaling abolished the effect of Dex on ossification and the upregulation of osteogenic markers. Taken together, our results suggest that OPLL is mediated by Osx via a mechanism involving the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, providing a basis for further research to identify potential targets for the treatment of OPLL.

Abstract: Summary
Cells use plasma membrane proton fluxes to maintain cytoplasmic and extracellular pH and to mediate the co-transport of metabolites and ions. Because proton-coupled transport often involves movement of multiple substrates, traditional electrical measurements provide limited information about proton transport at the cell surface. Here we visualize voltage-dependent proton fluxes over the entire landscape of a cell by covalently attaching small-molecule fluorescent pH sensors to the cell's glycocalyx. We found that the extracellularly facing sensors enable real-time detection of proton accumulation and depletion at the plasma membrane, providing an indirect readout of channel and transporter activity that correlated with whole-cell proton current. Moreover, the proton wavefront emanating from one cell was readily visible as it crossed over nearby cells. Given that any small-molecule fluorescent sensor can be covalently attached to a cell's glycocalyx, our approach is readily adaptable to visualize most electrogenic and non-electrogenic transport events at the plasma membrane.

Berberine attenuates high glucose-induced fibrosis by activating the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor TGR5 and repressing the S1P2/MAPK signaling pathway in glomerular mesangial cells,

Abstract: Berberine (BBR) exerts powerful renoprotective effects on diabetic nephropathy (DN), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We previously demonstrated that activation of the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor TGR5 ameliorates diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the activation of the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)/sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2) signaling pathway. In this study, we explored the role of TGR5 in the BBR-induced downregulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated fibrosis in glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs). Results showed that, BBR suppressed the expression of FN, ICAM-1, and TGF-β1 in high-glucose cultures of GMCs, and the phosphorylation level of c-Jun/c-Fos was downregulated. The high glucose lowered TGR5 expression in a time-dependent manner; this effect was reversed by BBR in a dose-dependent manner. The TGR5 agonist INT-777 decreased the high glucose-induced FN, ICAM-1, and TGF-β1 protein contents. In addition, TGR5 siRNA blocked S1P2 degradation by BBR. And MAPK signaling, which plays important regulatory roles in the pathological progression of DN, was activated by TGR5 siRNA. Apart from this, MAPK signaling as well as FN, ICAM-1, and TGF-β1 suppressed by BBR under high glucose conditions were limited by TGR5 depletion. Thus, BBR decreases FN, ICAM-1, and TGF-β1 levels under high glucose conditions in GMCs possibly by activating TGR5 and inhibiting S1P2/MAPK signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient clearance of bacteremia prevents life-threatening disease. Platelet binding to intravascular bacteria, a process involving platelet glycoprotein GPIb and bacterial opsonization with activated complement C3, influences blood clearance and anti-infective immunity. Using intravital microscopy of the bloodstream of mice infected with Listeria monocytogenes, we show that bacterial clearance is not a uniform process but a “dual-track” mechanism consisting of parallel “fast” and “slow” pathways. “Slow clearance” is regulated by time-dependent bacterial opsonization, stochastic platelet binding, and capture of bacteria-platelet-complexes via the complement receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, CRIg. The mechanism spares some bacteria from “fast clearance” and rapid destruction in the liver via Kupffer cell scavenger receptors, keeping them available for adaptive immunity induction by splenic CD8α+ dendritic cells. We consistently find “fast” and “slow” clearance patterns for a broad panel of other Gram+ and Gram− bacteria. Thus, dual-track clearance balances rapid restoration of blood sterility with induction of specific antibacterial immunity.

Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1)-signaling regulates the expression of the taxane-response biomarker PRP4K,

Abstract: The pre-mRNA splicing factor 4 kinase PRP4K (PRPF4B), is an essential kinase that is a component of the U5 snRNP and functions in spliceosome assembly. We demonstrated that PRP4K is a novel biological marker for taxane response in ovarian cancer patients and reduced levels of PRP4K correlate with intrinsic and acquired taxane resistance in both breast and ovarian cancer. Breast cancer treatments are chosen based on hormone and growth factor receptor status, with HER2 (ERBB2) positive breast cancer patients receiving anti-HER2 agents and taxanes and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) positive (ER+) breast cancer patients receiving anti-estrogen therapies such as tamoxifen. Here we demonstrate that PRP4K is expressed in the normal mammary duct epithelial cells of the mouse, and that estrogen induces PRP4K gene and protein expression in ER+ human MCF7 breast cancer cells. Estrogen acts through ESR1 to regulate PRP4K expression, as over-expression of ESR1 in the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line increased the expression of this kinase, and knock-down of ESR1 in ER+ T47D breast cancer cells reduced PRP4K levels. Furthermore, treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in PRP4K protein expression in MCF7 cells. Consistent with our previous studies identifying PRP4K as a taxane-response biomarker, reduced PRP4K expression in 4-OHT-treated cells correlated with reduced sensitivity to paclitaxel. Thus, PRP4K is novel estrogen regulated kinase, and its levels can be reduced by 4-OHT in ER+ breast cancer cells altering their response to taxanes.

Curcumin inhibits metastasis in human papillary thyroid carcinoma BCPAP cells via down-regulation of the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway,

Abstract: Thyroid cancers usually possess a good prognosis while the risks of recurrence and metastasis turn out to be a disturbing issue. Curcumin [bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione] is a natural polyphenolic compound mainly found in turmeric (Curcuma longa). Our previous studies have demonstrated that curcumin showed proliferation-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects on K1 papillary thyroid cancer cells. However, the mechanism underlying the inhibition effects of curcumin on thyroid cancer cells remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that curcumin remarkably increased the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and repressed the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in human papillary thyroid carcinoma BCPAP cells. Curcumin also suppressed multiple metastatic steps of BCPAP cells, including cell attachment, spreading as well as migration. In addition, the transcription, secretion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in BCPAP cells were mitigated upon curcumin treatment. Further evidence showed that curcumin decreased TGF-β1-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. These results revealed that curcumin inhibited the TGF-β1-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) via down-regulation of Smad2/3 signaling pathways. Our findings provide new evidence that the anti-metastatic and anti-EMT activities of curcumin may contribute to the development of chemo-preventive agents for thyroid cancer treatment.

Abstract: Recently, advantages concerning targeting specificity of PCR constructed oligonucleotide FISH probes in contrast to established FISH probes, e.g. BAC clones, have been demonstrated. These techniques, however, are still using labelling protocols with DNA denaturing steps applying harsh heat treatment with or without further denaturing chemical agents. COMBO-FISH (COMBinatorial Oligonucleotide FISH) allows the design of specific oligonucleotide probe combinations in silico. Thus, being independent from primer libraries or PCR laboratory conditions, the probe sequences extracted by computer sequence data base search can also be synthesized as single stranded PNA-probes (Peptide Nucleic Acid probes). Gene targets can be specifically labelled with at least about 20 PNA-probes obtaining visibly background free specimens. By using appropriately designed triplex forming oligonucleotides, the denaturing procedures can completely be omitted. These results reveal a significant step towards oligonucleotide-FISH maintaining the 3d-nanostructure and even the viability of the cell target. The method is demonstrated with the detection of Her2/neu and GRB7 genes, which are indicators in breast cancer diagnosis and therapy.

Abstract: In vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos show both cell cycle and developmental arrest. We previously showed oxidative damage activates the ATM → Chk1 → Cdc25B/Cdc25C cascade to mediate G2/M cell cycle arrest for repair of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative damage in sperm. However, the mechanisms underlying the developmental delay of zygotes are unknown. To develop a model of oxidative-damaged zygotes, we treated mouse zygotes with different concentrations of H2O2 (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05 mM), and evaluated in vitro zygote development, BrdU incorporation to detect the duration of S phase. We also examined reactive oxygen species level and used immunofluorescence to detect activation of γH2AX, Cdc2, and Cdc25. Oxidatively damaged zygotes showed a delay in G2/M phase and produced a higher level of ROS. At the same time, γH2AX was detected in oxidatively damaged zygotes as well as phospho-Cdc25B (Ser323), phospho-Cdc25C (Ser216), and phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr15). Our study indicates that oxidative stress-induced DNA damage of mouse zygotes triggers the cell cycle checkpoint, which results in G2/M cell cycle arrest, and that phospho-Cdc25B (Ser323), phospho-Cdc25C (Ser216), and phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr15) participate in activating the G2/M checkpoint.

Abstract: Aldosterone has been recognized as a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Studies have indicated that enhanced activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is associated with the development and progression of renal fibrosis. But if EGFR is involved in aldosterone-induced renal fibrosis is less investigated. In the present study, we examined the effect of erlotinib, an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, on the progression of aldosterone-induced renal profibrotic responses in a murine model underwent uninephrectomy. Erlotinib-treated rats exhibited relieved structural lesion comparing with rats treated with aldosterone alone, as characterized by glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial cell proliferation and expansion. Also, erlotinib inhibited the expression of TGF-β, α-SMA and mesangial matrix proteins such as collagen Ⅳ and fibronectin. In cultured mesangial cells, inhibition of EGFR also abrogated aldosterone-induced expression of extracellular matrix proteins, cell proliferation and migration. We also demonstrated that aldosterone induced the phosphorylation of EGFR through generation of ROS. And the activation of EGFR resulted in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, leading to the activation of profibrotic pathways. Taken together, we concluded that aldosterone-mediated tissue fibrosis relies on ROS induced EGFR/ERK activation, highlighting EGFR as a potential therapeutic target for modulating renal fibrosis.

Abstract: Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a maladaptive response in a variety of organic heart disease (OHD), which is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction that results from disturbed energy metabolism. SIRT3, a mitochondria-localized sirtuin, regulates global mitochondrial lysine acetylation and preserves mitochondrial function. However, the mechanisms by which SIRT3 regulates cardiac hypertrophy remains to be further elucidated. In this study, we firstly demonstrated that expression of SIRT3 was decreased in Angiotension II (Ang II)-treated cardiomyocytes and in hearts of Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophic mice. In addition, SIRT3 overexpression protected myocytes from hypertrophy, whereas SIRT3 silencing exacerbated Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In particular, SIRT3-KO mice exhibited significant cardiac hypertrophy. Mechanistically, we identified NMNAT3 (nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 3), the rate-limiting enzyme for mitochondrial NAD biosynthesis, as a new target and binding partner of SIRT3. Specifically, SIRT3 physically interacts with and deacetylates NMNAT3, thereby enhancing the enzyme activity of NMNAT3 and contributing to SIRT3-mediated anti-hypertrophic effects. Moreover, NMNAT3 regulates the activity of SIRT3 via synthesis of mitochondria NAD. Taken together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into the negative regulatory role of SIRT3 in cardiac hypertrophy.

Vitamin A and insulin are required for the maintenance of hepatic stellate cell quiescence,

Abstract: Transdifferentiation of vitamin A-storing hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to vitamin A-depleted myofibroblastic cells leads to liver fibrosis. Vitamin A regulates lipid accumulation and gene transcription, suggesting that vitamin A is involved in the maintenance of HSC quiescence under a physiological condition. However, the precise mechanism remains elusive because there is no appropriate in vitro culture system for quiescent HSCs. Here, we show that treatment of quiescent HSCs with vitamin A partially maintained the accumulation of lipid droplets and expression of quiescent HSC markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein, peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor-γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α) and also the expression of myofibroblastic markers (α-smooth muscle actin, heat shock protein 47 and collagen type I). On the other hand, combined treatment with vitamin A and insulin sustained the characteristic of HSC quiescence and completely suppressed the expression of myofibroblastic markers through activation of the JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway and increased expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1. These treated HSCs transdifferentiated to myofibroblastic cells under a culture condition with fetal bovine serum. The results suggest an important role of vitamin A and insulin in the maintenance of HSC quiescence under a physiological condition.

Abstract: Investigation of the host cytoskeleton during infection by bacterial pathogens has significantly contributed to our understanding of cell biology and host defense. Work has shown that septins are recruited to the phagocytic cup as collarlike structures and enable bacterial entry into host cells. In the cytosol, septins can entrap actin-polymerizing bacteria in cage-like structures for targeting to autophagy, a highly conserved intracellular degradation process. In this chapter, we describe methods to investigate septin assembly and function during infection by bacterial pathogens. Use of these methods can lead to in-depth understanding of septin biology and suggest therapeutic approaches to combat infectious disease.

Abstract: Summary
Essential characteristics of cellular signaling networks include a complex interconnected architecture and temporal dynamics of protein activity. The latter can be monitored by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors at a single-live-cell level with high temporal resolution. However, these experiments are typically limited to the use of a couple of FRET biosensors. Here, we describe a FRET-based multi-parameter imaging platform (FMIP) that allows simultaneous high-throughput monitoring of multiple signaling pathways. We apply FMIP to monitor the crosstalk between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor signaling, signaling perturbations caused by pathophysiologically relevant EGFR mutations, and the effects of a clinically important MEK inhibitor (selumetinib) on the EGFR network. We expect that in the future the platform will be applied to develop comprehensive models of signaling networks and will help to investigate the mechanism of action as well as side effects of therapeutic treatments.

Abstract: The functional dynamics of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) encompasses multiple spatiotemporal scales, ranging from femtoseconds to seconds and Ångströms to micrometers. Computational approaches, often in close collaboration with experimental methods, have been invaluable in unraveling GPCR structure and dynamics at these various hierarchical levels. The binding of natural and synthetic ligands to the wild-type and naturally occurring variant receptors have been analyzed by several computational methods. The activation of receptors from the inactive to the active state has been investigated by atomistic simulations and ongoing work on several receptors will help uncover general and receptor-specific mechanisms. The interaction of GPCRs with complex membranes that contain phospholipids and cholesterol have been probed by coarse-grain methods and shown to directly influence receptor association. In this chapter, we discuss computational approaches that have been successful in analyzing each scale of GPCR dynamics. An overview of these approaches will allow a more judicious choice of the appropriate method. We hope that an appreciation of the power of current computational approaches will encourage more critical collaborations. A comprehensive integration of the different approaches over the entire spatiotemporal scales promises to unravel new facets of GPCR function.

Abstract: Septins are polymerizing eukaryotic proteins that play conserved roles in cell cortex organization and are essential in many cell types. How septin dynamics and protein–protein interactions determine their function at the plasma membrane remains a mystery. Here, we present a method for recapitulating septin polymerization and lipid interaction utilizing supported lipid bilayers to mimic the eukaryotic plasma membrane. Septins on supported lipid bilayers can be visualized with single-molecule sensitivity using total internal reflective fluorescence microscopy. Microscopy-based in vitro assays have revolutionized our understanding of actin, microtubules, and bacterial cytoskeletal systems, and will likely immediately advance our understanding of the septin proteins. As such, we hope that this technique will be adopted and widely utilized by those interested in uncovering septin properties and functions of septin interacting proteins.

Abstract: Conditioned medium derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) shows immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects in preclinical models. Given the difficulty to harvest MSCs from bone marrow and adipose tissues, research has been focused to find alternative resources for MSCs, such as oral-derived tissues. Recently, we have demonstrated the protective effects of MSCs obtained from healthy human periodontal ligament tissue (hPDLSCs) in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. In the present in vitro study, we have investigated the immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects of conditioned medium obtained from hPDLSCs of Relapsing Remitting- Multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) patients on NSC34 mouse motoneurons stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immunocytochemistry and western blotting were performed. Increased level of TLR4 and NFκB, and reduced level of IκB-α were observed in LPS-stimulated motoneurons, which were modulated by pre-conditioning with hPDLSC-conditioned medium. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-10), neuroprotective markers (Nestin, NFL 70, NGF, GAP43), and apoptotic markers (Bax, Bcl-2, p21) were modulated. Moreover, extracellular vesicles of hPDLSC-conditioned medium showed the presence of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β. Our results demonstrate the immunosuppressive properties of hPDLSC-conditioned medium of RR-MS patients in motoneurons subjected to inflammation. Our findings warrant further preclinical and clinical studies to elucidate the autologous therapeutic efficacy of hPDLSC-conditioned medium in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The use of potent and selective chemical tools with well-defined targets can help elucidate biological processes driving phenotypes in phenotypic screens. However, identification of selective compounds en masse to create targeted screening sets is non-trivial. A systematic approach is needed to prioritize probes, which prevents the repeated use of published but unselective compounds. Here we performed a meta-analysis of integrated large-scale, heterogeneous bioactivity data to create an evidence-based, quantitative metric to systematically rank tool compounds for targets. Our tool score (TS) was then tested on hundreds of compounds by assessing their activity profiles in a panel of 41 cell-based pathway assays. We demonstrate that high-TS tools show more reliably selective phenotypic profiles than lower-TS compounds. Additionally we highlight frequently tested compounds that are non-selective tools and distinguish target family polypharmacology from cross-family promiscuity. TS can therefore be used to prioritize compounds from heterogeneous databases for phenotypic screening.

Abstract: The role of Invariant chain (CD74 or Ii) in antigen presentation via Antigen Presenting Cells (APC), macrophage recruitment as well as survival, T cell activation and B cell differentiation has been well recognized. However, the aspect of CD74 which is involved in the development of hepatic steatosis and the pathways through which it acts remain to be studied. In this study, we investigated the role of CD74 in the inflammatory pathway and its contribution to development of hepatic steatosis. For this, wild type C57BL/6J and CD74 deficient mice (Ii−/− mice) were fed with high fat high fructose (HFHF) diet for 12 weeks. Chronic consumption of this feed did not develop hepatic steatosis, glucose intolerance or change in the level of immune cells in Ii−/− mice. Moreover, there was relatively delayed expression of genes involved in development of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in HFHF fed Ii−/− mice as compared to that of C57BL/6J phenotype. Taken together, the data suggest that HFHF diet fed Ii−/− mice fail to develop hepatic steatosis, suggesting that Ii mediated pathways play a vital role in the initiation and propagation of liver inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
De novo ASXL1 mutations are found in patients with Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a disease with severe developmental defects and early childhood mortality. The underlying pathologic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using Asxl1-targeted murine models, we found that Asxl1 global loss as well as conditional deletion in osteoblasts and their progenitors led to significant bone loss and a markedly decreased number of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) compared with wild-type littermates. Asxl1−/− BMSCs displayed impaired self-renewal and skewed differentiation, away from osteoblasts and favoring adipocytes. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed altered expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, skeletal development, and morphogenesis. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis showed decreased expression of stem cell self-renewal gene signature, suggesting a role of Asxl1 in regulating the stemness of BMSCs. Importantly, re-introduction of Asxl1 normalized NANOG and OCT4 expression and restored the self-renewal capacity of Asxl1−/− BMSCs. Our study unveils a pivotal role of ASXL1 in the maintenance of BMSC functions and skeletal development.

Collective epithelial cell sheet adhesion and migration on polyelectrolyte multilayers with uniform and gradients of compliance,

Abstract: Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMUs) are tunable thin films that could serve as coatings for biomedical implants. PEMUs built layer by layer with the polyanion poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) modified with a photosensitive 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy) benzophenone (PAABp) group and the polycation poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) are mechanically tunable by UV irradiation, which forms covalent bonds between the layers and increases PEMU stiffness. PAH-terminated PEMUs (PAH-PEMUs) that were uncrosslinked, UV-crosslinked to a uniform stiffness, or UV-crosslinked with an edge mask or through a neutral density optical gradient filter to form continuous compliance gradients were used to investigate how differences in PEMU stiffness affect the adhesion and migration of epithelial cell sheets from scales of the fish Poecilia sphenops (Black Molly) and Carassius auratus (Comet Goldfish). During the progressive collective cell migration, the edge cells (also known as ‘leader’ cells) in the sheets on softer uncrosslinked PEMUs and less crosslinked regions of the gradient formed more actin filaments and vinculin-containing adherens junctions and focal adhesions than formed in the sheet cells on stiffer PEMUs or glass. During sheet migration, the ratio of edge cell to internal cell (also known as ‘follower’ cells) motilities were greater on the softer PEMUs than on the stiffer PEMUs or glass, causing tension to develop across the sheet and periods of retraction, during which the edge cells lost adhesion to the substrate and regions of the sheet retracted toward the more adherent internal cell region. These retraction events were inhibited by the myosin II inhibitor Blebbistatin, which reduced the motility velocity ratios to those for sheets on the stiffer PEMUs. Blebbistatin also caused disassembly of actin filaments, reorganization of focal adhesions, increased cell spreading at the leading edge, as well as loss of edge cell-cell connections in epithelial cell sheets on all surfaces. Interestingly, cells throughout the interior region of the sheets on uncrosslinked PEMUs retained their actin and vinculin organization at adherens junctions after treatment with Blebbistatin. Like Blebbistatin, a Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y27632, promoted loss of cell-cell connections between edge cells, whereas a Rac1 inhibitor, NSC23766, primarily altered the lamellipodial protrusion in edge cells. Compliance gradient PAH-PEMUs promoted durotaxis of the cell sheets but not of individual keratocytes, demonstrating durotaxis, like plithotaxis, is an emergent property of cell sheet organization.

Abstract: The Kunitz-type recombinant protein, Amblyomin-X, is an antitumor recombinant molecule from a cDNA library prepared from the salivary glands of the tick Amblyomma cajennense. The primary target of this protein appears to be the proteasome. Amblyomin-X increased gene and protein expression of distinct subunits of the molecular motor dynein, which plays a key role in the intracellular transport. Herein, Amblyomin-X was specifically taken up by tumor cells through lipid-raft endocytic pathways, but not by fibroblasts. Moreover, dynein inhibitor, ciliobrevin A, decreased Amblyomin-X uptake by tumor cells. Furthermore, incubation of tumor cells with Amblyomin-X inhibited trypsin-like activity of the proteasome, which was restored upon pretreatment with ciliobrevin A. Only in tumor cells treated with Amblyomin-X, we identified proteins bounds to dynein that are related to aggresome formation, autophagy inhibition, and early and recycling endosome markers. In addition, Amblyomin-X was found to interact with dynein, increased Rab11A protein expression and Rab11A co-localization with the light-intermediate chain 2 (LIC2) of dynein. Thereby, the results provide new insights on the antitumor mechanism of Amblyomin-X and reveal an unsuspected role of cytoplasmic dynein in its uptake, intracellular trafficking and pro-apoptotic action.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of tissue-specific cell types from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is critical for the development of future stem cell-based regenerative therapies. Here, we identify CD13 and ROR2 as cell-surface markers capable of selecting early cardiac mesoderm emerging during hESC differentiation. We demonstrate that the CD13+/ROR2+ population encompasses pre-cardiac mesoderm, which efficiently differentiates to all major cardiovascular lineages. We determined the engraftment potential of CD13+/ROR2+ in small (murine) and large (porcine) animal models, and demonstrated that CD13+/ROR2+ progenitors have the capacity to differentiate toward cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells in vivo. Collectively, our data show that CD13 and ROR2 identify a cardiac lineage precursor pool that is capable of successful engraftment into the porcine heart. These markers represent valuable tools for further dissection of early human cardiac differentiation, and will enable a detailed assessment of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac lineage cells for potential clinical applications.
