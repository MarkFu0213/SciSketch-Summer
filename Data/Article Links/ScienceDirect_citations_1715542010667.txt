Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency is controlled by defined transcription factors. During cellular differentiation, ESCs undergo a global epigenetic reprogramming. Female ESCs exemplify this process as one of the two X-chromosomes is globally silenced during X chromosome inactivation (XCI) to balance the X-linked gene disparity with XY males. The pluripotent factor OCT4 regulates XCI by triggering X chromosome pairing and counting. OCT4 directly binds Xite and Tsix, which encode two long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that suppress the silencer lncRNA, Xist. To control its activity as a master regulator in pluripotency and XCI, OCT4 must have chromatin protein partners. Here we show that BRD4, a member of the BET protein subfamily, interacts with OCT4. BRD4 occupies the regulatory regions of pluripotent genes and the lncRNAs of XCI. BET inhibition or depletion of BRD4 reduces the expression of many pluripotent genes and shifts cellular fate showing that BRD4 is pivotal for transcription in ESCs.

Abstract: Oxygen tension has emerged as a potent regulator of multiple erythrocyte properties, including glucose metabolism, cell volume, ATP release, and cytoskeletal organization. Because hemoglobin (Hb)1 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (cdb3) in an oxygen dependent manner, with deoxyHb exhibiting significantly greater affinity for cdb3 than oxyHb, the deoxyHb-cdb3 interaction has been hypothesized to constitute the molecular switch for all O2-controlled erythrocyte processes. In this study, we describe a rapid and accurate method for quantitating the interaction of deoxyHb binding to cdb3. For this purpose, enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) is fused to the COOH-terminus of cdb3, and the binding of Hb to the NH2-terminus of cdb3-eGFP is quantitated by Hb-mediated quenching of cdb3-eGFP fluorescence. As expected, the intensity of cdb3-eGFP fluorescence decreases only slightly following addition of oxyHb. However, upon deoxygenation of the same Hb-cdb3 solution, the fluorescence decreases dramatically (i.e. confirming that deoxyHb exhibits much greater affinity for cdb3 than oxyHb). Using this fluorescence quenching method, we not only confirm previously established characteristics of the Hb-cdb3 interaction, but also establish an assay that can be exploited to screen for inhibitors of the sickle Hb-cdb3 interaction that accelerates sickle Hb polymerization.

Abstract: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is the leading form of cancer in infancy, and compelling evidences suggest an involvement of altered immune competence on this malignancy pathogenesis. Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine designated as an immunosuppressive molecule, but may act as an immunostimulant factor in cancer development and progression. An IL-10 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1800896 has been associated with disease progression to ALL, and might influence cytokine expression. This study analyzed the IL-10 rs1800896 polymorphism and performed a case–control study to determine the significant associations with ALL susceptibility and prognosis. IL-10 plasma levels were determined and associated with genotypes and disease phase. The study consisted of 67 childhood ALL patients and 75 age-related healthy controls. The rs1800896 was not associated with ALL susceptibility or risk of relapse. No significant association was observed between different genotypes of the rs1800896 and plasma levels of IL-10. Cytokine plasma levels were significantly higher in the diagnosis group (9.71pg/mL±3.7), comparing to the treatment (3.48pg/mL±1.3; p=0.01) and remission phase (0.12pg/mL±0.1; p=0.0001) groups. This work indicates that the IL-10 plasma expression is altered from ALL disease diagnosis and remission. Moreover, prospective studies will establish the functional role of IL-10 in immune modulation in childhood ALL.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRs) are a group of small RNAs that play a major role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In animals, many of the miRs are expressed in a conserved spatiotemporal manner. Muscle tissues, the major cellular systems involved in the locomotion and physiological functions of animals, have been one of the main sites for verification of miR targets and analysis of their developmental functions. During the determination and differentiation of muscle cells, numerous miRs bind to and repress target mRNAs in a highly specific but redundant manner. Interspecific comparisons of the sequences and expression of miRs have suggested that miR regulation became increasingly important during the course of vertebrate evolution. However, the detailed molecular interactions that have led to the highly complex morphological structures still await investigation. In this review, we will summarize the recent findings on the functional and developmental characteristics of miRs that have played major roles in vertebrate myogenesis, and discuss how the evolution of miRs is related to the morphological complexity of the vertebrates.

Abstract: The α hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) binds α-Hb and prevents its precipitation limiting free α-Hb toxicities. Our aim was to study AHSP expression in β thalassemia syndromes in relation to their clinical severity and to compare it with its level in sickle cell anemia. We compared patients with β-thalassemia (n=37) (β-thalassemia major (BTM) (n=19) and β-thalassemia intermedia (BTI) (n=18)) with 12 patients with sickle cell anemia as regards clinical severity, age at presentation, transfusion dependency, mean pre-transfusion hemoglobin level, use of hydroxyurea and AHSP expression by real time quantitative PCR. Median (and IQR) AHSP expression was significantly higher in patients with sickle cell anemia 2275 (3898) compared to thalassemia 283 (718), P=0.001, with no significant difference between BTM and BTI (P=0.346). It was also significantly higher in non-transfusion dependent patients with β thalassemia (NTDT) compared to transfusion dependent ones (P=0.019), and in patients on hydroxyurea therapy (P<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in its level according to clinical severity score (P=0.946) or splenectomy status (P=0.145).
Conclusion
AHSP expression was higher in patients with sickle cell anemia versus thalassemia, with no significant difference between BTM and BTI. Expression was higher in patients with NTDT and on hydroxyurea therapy.

Abstract: The human inducible heat shock protein 70 (hHsp70), which is involved in several major pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, is a key molecular chaperone and contributes to the proper protein folding and maintenance of a large number of protein structures. Despite its role in disease, the current structural knowledge of hHsp70 is almost exclusively based on its Escherichia coli homolog, DnaK, even though these two proteins only share ~50 % amino acid identity. For the first time, we describe a complete heterologous production and purification strategy that allowed us to obtain a large amount of soluble, full-length, and non-tagged hHsp70. The protein displayed both an ATPase and a refolding activity when combined to the human Hsp40. Multi-angle light scattering and bio-layer interferometry analyses demonstrated the ability of hHsp70 to homodimerize. The role of the C-terminal part of hHsp70 was identified and confirmed by a study of a truncated version of hHsp70 that could neither dimerize nor present refolding activity.

Abstract: Examining the collective mechanical behaviors of interacting cytoskeletal motors has become increasingly important to dissecting the complex and multifaceted mechanisms that regulate the transport and trafficking of materials in cells. Although studying these processes in living cells has been challenging, the development of new Synthetic Biology techniques has opened unique opportunities to both manipulate and probe how these motors function in groups as they navigate the native cytoskeleton. Here, we describe an approach to engineer mammalian cells for a new class of inducible cargo motility assays that utilize drug-dependent protein dimerization switches to regulate motor—cargo coupling and transport. Our adaptations provide genetic-level control over the densities of motor proteins coupled to, as well as the sizes of endogenous vesicular cargos in these assays. By allowing the examination of transport responses to changes in motor density and cargo size-dependent viscous drag force, such control can enable quantitative comparisons of mechanistic distinctions between the collective behaviors of different types of processive cytoskeletal motors.

Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignant cancer with poor prognosis. This study aims to investigate the roles of homeobox A10 (HOXA10) in GC and the correlations between HOXA10/CD44 expression and GC prognosis. Based on qRT-PCR and Western Blot analyses in 50 pairs of fresh GC samples and adjacent normal samples, it is identified that HOXA10 was significantly up-regulated in GC tissues at mRNA and protein levels. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were enhanced in GC cells with overexpressed HOXA10, while inhibited in cells with silenced HOXA10. Through IPA software, HOXA10 was predicted to interact with CD44 via MSN, which was preliminarily confirmed by using Western Blot. Through immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray (N=264), it is found that HOXA10 expression was significantly correlated with tumor size (P=0.011) and CD44 expression (P<0.001), while CD44 expression was significantly correlated with tumor size (P<0.001), depth of tumor invasion (P<0.001), lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), distant metastasis (P=0.001), UICC stage (P<0.001), histological differentiation (P<0.001), and HOXA10 expression (P<0.001). Additionally, the over-all survival and disease-free survival of HOXA10+/CD44+ patients were dramatically decreased in comparison with that of HOXA10+/CD44−, HOXA10−/CD44+, or HOXA10−/CD44− patients (P<0.001), suggesting that the combinatory expression of HOXA10 and CD44 was correlated with poor GC prognosis. In conclusion, HOXA10 and CD44 might play roles in GC tumorigenesis, metastasis, and invasion. HOXA10+/CD44+ expression might serve as a prognostic biomarker for GC, which needs more studies to validate.

Abstract: The indifferent mammalian embryonic gonad generates an ovary or testis, but the factors involved are still poorly known. The Wnt-4 signal represents one critical female determinant, since its absence leads to partial female-to-male sex reversal in mouse, but its signalling is as well implicated in the testis development. We used the Wnt-4 deficient mouse as a model to identify candidate gonadogenesis genes, and found that the Notum, Phlda2, Runx-1 and Msx1 genes are typical of the wild-type ovary and the Osr2, Dach2, Pitx2 and Tacr3 genes of the testis. Strikingly, the expression of these latter genes becomes reversed in the Wnt-4 knock-out ovary, suggesting a role in ovarian development. We identified the transcription factor Runx-1 as a Wnt-4 signalling target gene, since it is expressed in the ovary and is reduced upon Wnt-4 knock-out. Consistent with this, introduction of the Wnt-4 signal into early ovary cells ex vivo induces Runx-1 expression, while conversely Wnt-4 expression is down-regulated in the absence of Runx-1. We conclude that the Runx-1 gene can be a Wnt-4 signalling target, and that Runx-1 and Wnt-4 are mutually interdependent in their expression. The changes in gene expression due to the absence of Wnt-4 in gonads reflect the sexually dimorphic role of this signal and its complex gene network in mammalian gonad development.

Abstract: Primary and motile cilia differ in their structure, composition, and function. In the brain, primary cilia are immotile signalling organelles present on neural stem cells and neurons. Multiple motile cilia are found on the surface of ependymal cells in all brain ventricles, where they contribute to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. During development, monociliated ependymal progenitor cells differentiate into multiciliated ependymal cells, thus providing a simple system for studying the transition between these two stages. In this chapter, we provide protocols for immunofluorescence staining of developing ependymal cells in vivo, on whole mounts of lateral ventricle walls, and in vitro, on cultured ependymal cells. We also provide a list of markers we currently use to stain both types of cilia, including proteins at the ciliary membrane and tubulin posttranslational modifications of the axoneme.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is characterized by glucocerebroside (GC) accumulation due to defective activity of the glucocerebrosidase (GlcCerase) enzyme. Monocytes and macrophages exhibit the highest GlcCerase activity and are most prominently affected by GC engorgement. As GD patients tend to exert various immune system-related changes, this study was designed to investigate potential effects of monocyte dysfunction on these alterations. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of untreated GD patients and healthy volunteers. Monocyte migration capacity towards SDF1α was assessed. The GD patients exhibited reduced numbers of monocytes and decreased capability of SDF1α-dependent monocyte migration. Evaluation of CXCR4, the SDF1α receptor, revealed reduced expression of surface CXCR4 on GD-derived monocytes, despite similar CXCR4 mRNA transcript levels in the monocytes of healthy volunteers and GD patients. Reduction of surface CXCR4 was accompanied by increased intracellular CXCR4 levels in patient monocytes. This elevated intracellular CXCR4 might reflect significantly increased SDF1α concentrations characterizing patients' serum and the lysosomal impairment of GD, resulting in decreased degradation of CXCR4. Different distributions of CXCR4 expression observed in the two groups explain impaired SDF1α-dependent monocyte migration. Reduced numbers and impaired migration capacity of GD-derived monocytes could contribute to abnormal inflammation and GD-associated immune alterations seen in these patients.

Abstract: Competitive endogenous messenger RNA regulates the transcription of other RNA moleculars through competing for the shared microRNAs. This study was carried out to explore the regulation of AEG-1 messenger RNA as a competitive endogenous RNA in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and metastasis of lung tumor cells. It is shown that the epithelial–mesenchymal transition was associated with the down-regulation of miR-30a, up-regulation of AEG-1 and mesenchymal markers (Snail and Vimentin); miR-30a inhibited the metastasis of lung tumor A549 cells in vitro, whereas AEG-1 promoted it. These results suggested the potential linkage between miR-30a and genes (AEG-1, Snail and Vimentin) in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and metastasis of lung tumor cell. It was verified later that the 3′-untranslated regions of AEG-1, Snail and Vimentin bind to miR-30a in A549 cells. Therefore, a competitive endogenous RNAs regulatory network among AEG-1, Snail and Vimentin mediated via competitive binding to miR-30a was proved. That is, the 3′-untranslated region of AEG-1, functioning as the competitive endogenous RNAs, indirectly regulated the expression of Vimentin and Snail in inducing epithelial–mesenchymal transition of human non-small cell lung cancer. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated a competitive endogenous RNAs regulatory network which will help understand the metastasis mechanisms of lung cancer and improve the prevention and treatment of lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Postnatal mammary gland development and differentiation occur during puberty and pregnancy. To explore the role of DNA methylation in these processes, we determined the genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of CD24+CD61+CD29hi, CD24+CD61+CD29lo, and CD24+CD61−CD29lo cell populations that were previously associated with distinct biological properties at different ages and reproductive stages. We found that pregnancy had the most significant effects on CD24+CD61+CD29hi and CD24+CD61+CD29lo cells, inducing distinct epigenetic states that were maintained through life. Integrated analysis of gene expression, DNA methylation, and histone modification profiles revealed cell-type- and reproductive-stage-specific changes. We identified p27 and TGFβ signaling as key regulators of CD24+CD61+CD29lo cell proliferation, based on their expression patterns and results from mammary gland explant cultures. Our results suggest that relatively minor changes in DNA methylation occur during luminal differentiation compared with the effects of pregnancy on CD24+CD61+CD29hi and CD24+CD61+CD29lo cells.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate monitoring of tumor dynamics and leukemic stem cell (LSC) heterogeneity is important for the development of personalized cancer therapies. In this study, we experimentally induced distinct types of leukemia in mice by enforced expression of Cbx7. Simultaneous cellular barcoding allowed for thorough analysis of leukemias at the clonal level and revealed high and unpredictable tumor complexity. Multiple LSC clones with distinct leukemic properties coexisted. Some of these clones remained dormant but bore leukemic potential, as they progressed to full-blown leukemia after challenge. LSC clones could retain multilineage differentiation capacities, where one clone induced phenotypically distinct leukemias. Beyond a detailed insight into CBX7-driven leukemic biology, our model is of general relevance for the understanding of tumor dynamics and clonal evolution.

Abstract: The segmented genome of influenza viruses is translocated into the nucleus to initiate transcription and replication. The gene segments are present as viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) particles composed of RNA, multiple copies of the nucleoprotein (NP), and the polymerase subunits PB1, PB2 and PA. The PB2 subunit and each NP monomer contain a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) that binds to importin-α. To throw light on the role of the NLSs of NP and PB2 in nuclear transport, we have analysed the effect of mutation D701N, responsible for the exposure of the NLS domain of PB2, on the intracellular localisation of vRNPs. We show that exposure of PB2 NLS significantly enhances the amount of vRNPs present in the nucleus. These observations suggest that entry of vRNPs into the nucleus depends on controlled interplay of the NLSs of PB2 and NP with the nuclear import machinery.

Abstract: Heme, the prosthetic group of hemoglobin, may be released from its host due to an intrinsic instability of hemoglobin and accumulate in the erythrocytes. Free heme is in the form of hematin (Fe3+ protoporphyrin IX OH) and follows several pathways of biochemical toxicity to tissues, cells, and organelles since it catalyzes the production of reactive oxygen species. To determine concentration of soluble free heme in human erythrocytes, we develop a new method. We lyse the red blood cells and isolate free heme from hemoglobin by dialysis. We use the heme to reconstitute horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from an excess of the apoenzyme and determine the HRP reaction rate from the evolution of the emitted luminescence. We find that in a population of five healthy adults the average free heme concentration in the erythrocytes is 21±2μM, ca. 100× higher than previously determined. Tests suggest that the lower previous value was due to the use of elevated concentrations of NaCl, which drive hematin precipitation and re-association with apoglobin. We show that the found hematin concentration is significantly higher than estimates based on equilibrium release and the known hematin dimerization. The factors that lead to enhanced heme release remain an open question.

Abstract: Ames hypopituitary dwarf mice are deficient in growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and prolactin. The phenotype of these mice demonstrates irregularities in the immune system with skewing of the normal cytokine milieu towards a more anti-inflammatory environment. However, the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell composition of the bone marrow (BM) and spleen in Ames dwarf mice has not been well characterized. We found that there was a significant decrease in overall cell count when comparing the BM and spleen of 4–5month old dwarf mice to their littermate controls. Upon adjusting counts to differences in body weight between the dwarf and control mice, the number of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, confirmed by immunophenotyping and colony-formation assay was increased in the BM. In contrast, the numbers of all myeloid progenitor populations in the spleen were greatly reduced, as confirmed by colony-formation assays. This suggests that there is a shift of myelopoiesis from the spleen to the BM of Ames dwarf mice; however, this shift does not appear to involve erythropoiesis. The reasons for this unusual shift in spleen to marrow hematopoiesis in Ames dwarf mice are yet to be determined but may relate to the decreased hormone levels in these mice.

Abstract: Insulin resistance has been described in association with chronic liver disease for decades. Hepatocyte senescence has been demonstrated in chronic liver disease and as many as 80% of hepatocytes show a senescent phenotype in advanced liver disease. The aim of this study was to understand the role of hepatocyte senescence in the development of insulin resistance. Senescence was induced in HepG2 cells via oxidative stress. The insulin metabolic pathway was studied in control and senescent cells following insulin stimulation. GLUT2 and GLUT4 expressions were studied in HepG2 cells and human liver tissue. Further, GLUT2 and GLUT4 expressions were studied in three independent chronic liver disease cohorts. Signalling impairment distal to Akt in phosphorylation of AS160 and FoxO1 was evident in senescent HepG2 cells. Persistent nuclear localisation of FoxO1 was demonstrated in senescent cells despite insulin stimulation. Increased GLUT4 and decreased GLUT2 expressions were evident in senescent cells, human cirrhotic liver tissue and publically available liver disease datasets. Changes in GLUT expressions were associated with a poor clinical prognosis. In conclusion, selective insulin resistance is evident in senescent HepG2 cells and changes in GLUT expressions can be used as surrogate markers of hepatocyte senescence.

Abstract: Fundamental biological processes including morphogenesis and tissue repair require cells to migrate collectively. In these processes, epithelial or endothelial cells move in a cooperative manner coupled by intercellular junctions. Ultimately, the movement of these multicellular systems occurs through the generation of cellular forces, exerted either on the substrate via focal adhesions (cell–substrate forces) or on neighboring cells through cell–cell junctions (cell–cell forces). Quantitative measurements of multicellular forces and kinematics with cellular or subcellular resolution have become possible only in recent years. In this chapter, we describe some of these techniques, which include particle image velocimetry to map cell velocities, traction force microscopy to map forces exerted by cells on the substrate, and monolayer stress microscopy to map forces within and between cells. We also describe experimental protocols to perform these measurements. The combination of these techniques with high-resolution imaging tools and molecular perturbations will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying collective cell migration in health and disease.

Abstract: Dlg5 (Discs large homolog 5), a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase adaptor family of scaffolding proteins, has been shown to participate in cancer progression. However, little is known about whether abnormal expression of Dlg5 facilitates bladder cancer metastasis. In the current study we initiated a study analyzing Dlg5 expression and its roles in human bladder cancer metastasis. The expression of Dlg5 is decreased in most bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and Dlg5 expression is further downregulated in patients with muscle-invasive tumors. DNA methylation analysis showed a methylation of Dlg5 gene in bladder cancer cell lines and in bladder cancer tumors, especially in muscle-invasive tumors. Hypermethylation of Dlg5 in bladder tumors is tightly correlated with silencing of Dlg5 expression, which is further functionally validated by demethylation analysis in bladder cancer cell lines. Knockdown of Dlg5 increases cancer cell invasion in vitro and promotes cancer metastasis in vivo. Of clinical significance, Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that downregulation of Dlg5 is significantly associated with reduced overall survival in patients with bladder cancer.
Conclusion
These data suggest that inhibition of Dlg5 by DNA hypermethylation contributes to provoke invasive phenotypes in bladder tumor.

Abstract: Small non-coding RNAs are indispensable to many biological processes. A class of endogenous small RNAs, termed PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) because of their association with PIWI proteins, has known roles in safeguarding the genome against inordinate transposon mobilization, embryonic development, and stem cell regulation, among others. This review discusses the biogenesis of animal piRNAs and their diverse functions together with their PIWI protein partners, both in the germline and in somatic cells, and highlights the evolutionarily conserved aspects of these molecular players in animal biology.

Abstract: Circadian rhythms are controlled by a molecular mechanism that is organized in transcriptional and translational feedback loops of gene expression. Recent studies have been demonstrating the involvement of microRNAs (miRs) in post-transcriptional/translational control of circadian rhythms. In the present study we aimed to analyze the daily variations of miR-16 and miR-181a expression in human leukocytes. These miRs were independently associated with hematopoiesis and circadian rhythms in previous studies using experimental models. Peripheral blood from 6 subjects was sampled in a 24hour period for expression analysis using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Initially, we evaluated the expression stability of RNU6-2, RNU1A-1, RNU5A-1, SNORD-25, SCARNA-17 and SNORA-73A as candidate genes for normalization of RT-qPCR data. The combination of the four most stable genes (SNORA-73A/SCARNA-17/SNORD-25/RNU6-2) was indicated to provide a better normalization of miRs expressions. The results show a daily variation of miR-181a and miR-16 expression in human leukocytes, suggesting a potential participation of these genes in the modulation of the circadian rhythms present in blood cells.

Abstract: Diagnostic genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis is readily available for clinically relevant HFE variants (i.e., those that generate the C282Y, H63D and S65C HFE polymorphisms); however, genetic testing for other known causes of iron overload, including mutations affecting genes encoding hemojuvelin, transferrin receptor 2, HAMP, and ferroportin is not. As an alternative to conventional genetic testing we propose diagnostic use of whole exome sequencing for characterization of non-HFE hemochromatosis. To illustrate the effectiveness of whole exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool, we present the case of an 18-year-old female with a probable case of juvenile hemochromatosis, who was referred for specialty care after testing negative for commonly occurring HFE variants. Whole exome sequencing offered complete coverage of target genes and is a fast, cost effective diagnostic tool for characterization of non-HFE hemochromatosis.

Abstract: Cilia are key organelles in development and homeostasis. The ever-expanding complement of cilia associated proteins necessitates rapid and tractable models for in vivo functional investigation. Xenopus laevis provides an attractive model for such studies, having multiple ciliated populations, including primary and multiciliated tissues. The rapid external development of Xenopus and the large cells make it an especially excellent platform for imaging studies. Here we present embryological and cell biological methods for the investigation of cilia structure and function in X. laevis, with a focus on quantitative live and fixed imaging.

Abstract: Cells move and change shape by dynamically reorganizing their cytoskeleton next to the plasma membrane. In particular, actin assembly generates forces and stresses that deform the cell membrane. Cell-sized liposomes are designed to mimic this function. The activation of actin polymerization at their membrane is able to push the membrane forward, thus reproducing the mechanism of lamellipodium extension at the cell front. Moreover, the cell cortex, a submicrometer-thick actin shell right beneath the cell membrane can be reproduced; it contributes to cell tension with the action of molecular motors. We will describe experimental methods to prepare liposomes that mimic the inside geometry of a cell, and that reproduce actin-based propulsion of the liposome using an outside geometry. Such systems allow to study how actin-related proteins control and affect actin cortex assembly and can produce forces that drive cell shape changes.

Abstract: Background
: Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in sickle cell anemia patients vary. We genotyped polymorphisms in the erythroid-specific enhancer of BCL11A to see if they might account for the very high HbF associated with the Arab–Indian (AI) haplotype and Benin haplotype of sickle cell anemia.
Methods and results
: Six BCL112A enhancer SNPs and their haplotypes were studied in Saudi Arabs from the Eastern Province and Indian patients with AI haplotype (HbF ~20%), African Americans (HbF ~7%), and Saudi Arabs from the Southwestern Province (HbF ~12%). Four SNPs (rs1427407, rs6706648, rs6738440, and rs7606173) and their haplotypes were consistently associated with HbF levels. The distributions of haplotypes differ in the 3 cohorts but not their genetic effects: the haplotype TCAG was associated with the lowest HbF level and the haplotype GTAC was associated with the highest HbF level and differences in HbF levels between carriers of these haplotypes in all cohorts were approximately 6%.
Conclusions
: Common HbF BCL11A enhancer haplotypes in patients with African origin and AI sickle cell anemia have similar effects on HbF but they do not explain their differences in HbF.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by mutations in the GBA gene that confer a deficient level of activity of glucocerebrosidase (GCase). This deficiency leads to the accumulation of the glycolipid glucocerebroside in the lysosomes of cells of monocyte/macrophage system. Bone compromise in Gaucher disease patients is the most disabling aspect of the disease. However, pathophysiological aspects of skeletal alterations are still poorly understood. On the other hand it is well known that inflammation is a key player in GD pathology. In this work, we revealed increased levels of the proinflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocyte subset and increased inflammatory cytokine production by monocytes and T cells in the circulation of GD patients. We showed increased levels of osteoclast precursors in PBMC from patients and a higher expression of RANKL in the surface of T cells. PBMC from patients presented higher osteoclast differentiation compared to healthy controls when cultured in the presence of M-CSF alone or in combination with RANKL. In vitro treatment with Velaglucerase reduced osteoclast levels to control levels. On the other hand THP-1 derived osteoclast precursors cultured in the presence of conditioned media from PBMC of GD patients presented higher differentiation to active osteoclasts. This induction involved TNF-α and RANKL.

Abstract: There are lines of evidence demonstrating that NEDD9 (Cas-L, HEF-1) plays a key role in the development, progression, and metastasis of breast cancer cells. We previously reported that NEDD9 plays a critical role for promoting migration and growth of MDA-MB-231. In order to further characterize the mechanisms of NEDD9-mediated cancer migration and growth, stable cells overexpressing NEDD9 were generated using HCC38 as a parental cell line which expresses low level of endogenous NEDD9. Microarray studies demonstrated that core proteins of CD44 and Serglycin were markedly upregulated in HCC38(NEDD9) cells compared to HCC38(Vector) cells, while those of Syndecan-1, Syndecan-2, and Versican were downregulated in HCC38(NEDD9). Importantly, enzymes generating chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (CS) such as CHST11, CHST15, and CSGALNACT1 were upregulated in HCC38(NEDD9) compared to HCC38(Vector). Immunofluorescence studies using specific antibody, GD3G7, confirmed the enhanced expression of CS-E subunit in HCC38(NEDD9). Immunoprecipitation and western blotting analysis demonstrated that CS-E was attached to CD44 core protein. We demonstrated that removing CS by chondroitinase ABC significantly inhibited anchorage-independent colony formation of HCC38(NEDD9) in methylcellulose. Importantly, the fact that GD3G7 significantly inhibited colony formation of HCC38(NEDD9) cells suggests that CS-E subunit plays a key role in this process. Furthermore, treatment of HCC38(NEDD9) cells with chondroitinase ABC or GD3G7 significantly inhibited mammosphere formation. Exogenous addition of CS-E enhanced colony formation and mammosphere formation of HCC38 parental and HCC38(Vector) cells. These results suggest that NEDD9 regulates the synthesis and expression of tumor associated glycocalyx structures including CS-E, which plays a key role in promoting and regulating breast cancer progression and metastasis and possibly stem cell phenotypes.

Abstract: Regulation of NFkB family member RelA translocation by tumour suppressor genes encoding p53 and KLF4, has been widely recognized as the critical for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to meet their energy requirement for tailoring their immune response against any perceived threat. Our study was addressed to understand as to how human PBMCs respond to high glucose threat in terms of their genomics-directed immune response. The results of such a study revealed for the first time that NFkB induced miR-2909 RNomics is crucial for the regulation of RelA translocation within human PBMCs exposed to high glucose thereby enabling these epigenetically programmed cells to tailor immune response involving genes coding for CCL5; IFN-γ and IL-17. Based upon these results an attempt was also made to propose a mechanistic pathway that links high glucose induced cellular miR-2909 RNomics with the genes involved in energy metabolism and immune response.

Abstract: Single-molecule speckle (SiMS) microscopy has been a powerful method to analyze actin dynamics in live cells by tracking single molecule of fluorescently labeled actin. Recently we developed a new SiMS method, which is easy-to-use for inexperienced researchers and achieves high spatiotemporal resolution. In this method, actin labeled with fluorescent DyLight dye on lysines is employed as a probe. Electroporation-mediated delivery of DyLight-actin (DL-actin) into cells enables to label cells with 100% efficiency at the optimal density. DL-actin labels cellular actin filaments including formin-based structures with improved photostability and brightness compared to green fluorescent protein-actin. These favorable properties of DL-actin extend time window of the SiMS analysis. Furthermore, the new SiMS method enables nanometer-scale displacement analysis with a low localization error of ±8–8.5nm. With these advantages, our new SiMS microscopy method will help researchers to investigate various actin remodeling processes. In this chapter, we introduce the methods for preparation of DL-actin probes, electroporation to deliver DL-actin, the SiMS imaging and data analysis.

Abstract: Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa) play a pivotal role in the endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization and regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. For activation, KCa depend on an increase of intracellular calcium which is substantially mediated by Ca2+-permeable cation channels including the transient receptor potential V4 (TRPV4). It has been proposed that KCa and Ca2+-permeable cation channels may be clustered in localized positions within the cell membrane to form functional units and that caveolae may constitute the scaffolding for such microcompartmental organization. Here, we sought to elucidate the composition and functional relevance of these microcompartments in vitro and in vivo. We show that TRPV4 and small-conductance KCa2.3 are enriched in caveolae of human microvascular endothelial cells. Using immunoprecipitation, immunocytology and superresolution microscopy, we found a caveolae-dependent association between caveolin-1, TRPV4 and small conductance KCa2.3, but not intermediate conductance KCa3.1, in endothelial cells under static condition. Mechanical stimulation of cells via exposure to shear stress led to a partial de-novo colocalization of KCa3.1 with Cav-1 and TRPV4. In a mouse model of genetic Cav-1 deficiency, we found significantly reduced KCa-mediated currents as determined by patch-clamping in carotid artery endothelial cells (CAEC) from Cav-1−/− mice compared to wildtype. Functionally, Cav-1 deficiency was associated with impaired endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-mediated vasodilation in response to shear stress and acetylcholine. In summary, our findings provide evidence for a dynamic microcompartmentation of TRPV4/KCa in caveolae of endothelial cells and highlight the importance of Cav-1 for endothelial KCa functions and flow-induced vasodilation.

Abstract: IL-6 plays an important role in various inflammatory ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy. Müller cells are the major source of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, in the retina. However, the mechanism of regulating IL-6 production in these cells remains unclear. Examination of signaling pathways in human retinal Müller cells (MIO-M1 cell line) cultured with IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, IFN-γ, glucose or mannitol showed that IL-1β was the most potent stimulator of IL-6 production. In addition, IL-1 β also increased NF-κB p50 protein level and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and c-Jun. Induction of IL-6 production by IL-1β was significantly reduced by addition of p38 MAPK (SB203580), MEK1/2 (U0126) or NF-κB (BAY11-7082) inhibitors, with the highest effect being observed with SB203580. To explore the specific elements in IL-6 promoter responsible for IL-1β-induction of IL-6 expression, a series of plasmids bearing various IL-6 promoter mutations were transiently expressed in MIO-MI cells cultured in the presence or absence of IL-1β (10ng/ml) and/or SB203580 (10µM). Results showed that IL-6 promoter activity of the parent pIL-6-Luc651 was significantly enhanced by IL-1β, but the level was significantly attenuated by SB203580. Furthermore, the IL-6 promoter activity was also reduced upon deletion of NF-κB, AP-1 or C/EBP binding sites, with NF-κB deletion being the greatest. These results are the first demonstration that IL-1β induces IL-6 production in Müller cells by activation of IL-6 promoter activity predominantly through the p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathway.

The purpose of this paper is to test if an acute dose of oral glutamine prior to exercise reduces intestinal permeability along with activation of the heat shock response leading to inhibition of pro-inflammatory markers. Physically active subjects (N = 7) completed baseline and exercise intestinal permeability tests, determined by the percent ratio of urinary lactulose (5 g) to rhamnose (2 g). Exercise included two 60-min treadmill runs at 70 % of VO2max at 30°C after ingestion of glutamine (Gln) or placebo (Pla). Plasma levels of endotoxin and TNF-α, along with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) protein expression of HSP70 and IκBα, were measured pre- and post-exercise and 2 and 4 h post-exercise. Permeability increased in the Pla trial compared to that at rest (0.06±0.01 vs. 0.02 ± 0.018) and did not increase in the Gln trial. Plasma endotoxin was lower at the 4-h time point in the Gln vs. 4 h in the Pla (6.715±0.046 pg/ml vs. 7.952±1.11 pg/ml). TNF-α was lower 4 h post-exercise in the Gln vs. Pla (1.64±0.09 pg/ml vs. 1.87±0.12 pg/ml). PBMC expression of IkBα was higher 4 h post-exercise in the Gln vs. 4 h in the Pla (1.29±0.43 vs. 0.8892 ± 0.040). HSP70 was higher pre-exercise and 2 h post-exercise in the Gln vs. Pla (1.35±0.21 vs. 1.000±0.000 and 1.65±0.21 vs. 1.27 ± 0.40). Acute oral glutamine supplementation prevents an exercise-induced rise in intestinal permeability and suppresses NF-κB activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Abstract: In this study, we determined the effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling on myofibroblast differentiation of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts in vitro and evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of NSC668036 in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis murine model. In vitro study, NSC668036, a small organic inhibitor of the PDZ domain in Dvl, suppressed β-catenin-driven gene transcription and abolished TGF-β1-induced migration, expression of collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in fibroblasts. In vivo study, we found that NSC668036 significantly suppressed accumulation of collagen I, α-SMA, and TGF-β1 but increased the expression of CK19, Occludin and E-cadherin that can inhibit pulmonary fibrogenesis. Because fibrotic lung exhibit aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, these data collectively suggest that inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling at the Dvl level may be an effective approach to the treatment of fibrotic lung diseases.

Abstract: Gonadal hypofunction is described in male and female patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) after bone marrow transplant (BMT) and in males treated with hydroxyurea (HU). Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a serum marker of ovarian reserve. This study describes AMH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in female SCA subjects treated with supportive care (SCA-SC), HU (SCA-HU) and BMT (SCA-BMT). SCA (SS/Sβ0) subjects not on HU, on HU and status-post BMT, ages 10–21years were recruited. SCA-HU subjects were treated with HU≥20mg/kg for ≥12 consecutive months. SCA-BMT subjects had received busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Serum AMH and random FSH levels were obtained. Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) was defined as AMH level <5th percentile for age-matched controls. Subjects also with FSH >40IU/L were classified as having premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). 14 SCA-SC (14.5±2.7years), 33 SCA-HU (14.4±2.4years) and 9 SCA-BMT (14.3±2.7years) females were included. AMH was undetectable in all SCA-BMT subjects and <5th percentile in 24% of SCA-HU subjects. FSH was menopausal (>40IU/L) in 88.9% of SCA-BMT subjects. All SCA-BMT subjects and 24% of subjects on HU had DOR; 89% of SCA-BMT subjects had POI. AMH and FSH may be useful tools in assessing ovarian reserve and function.

Abstract: While early fluorescence microscopy experiments employing fluorescent probes afforded snapshots of the cell, the power of live-cell microscopy is required to understand complex dynamics in biological processes. The first successful cloning of green fluorescent protein in the 1990s paved the way for development of approaches that we now utilize for visualization in a living cell. In this chapter, we discuss a technique to observe fluorescently tagged single molecules in fission yeast. With a few simple modifications to the established total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, cytoplasmic dynein molecules in the cytoplasm and on the microtubules can be visualized and their intracellular dynamics can be studied. We illustrate a technique to study motor behavior, which is not apparent in conventional ensemble studies of motors. In general, this technique can be employed to study single-molecule dynamics of fluorescently tagged proteins in the cell interior.

Abstract: Although genetic mutations have long been known to influence gene expression and individual phenotype, studies emerging over the past decade indicate that such changes can also be induced in the absence of alterations in base-sequence. Epigenetically driven changes in gene expression or phenotype, when they are transmitted to succeeding generations, represent an entirely new mechanism that could generate heritable variation in a population. To understand the mechanistic basis of epigenetic inheritance, it is essential to learn how these changes may be transmitted through the germ-line to the next generation. Here, we review the process of female germ cell specification, oocyte growth, and meiotic maturation. We discuss what is known of the activity and role of three principal candidates to transmit epigenetic information – DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and short non-coding RNAs – in the developing oocyte. We then consider intergenerational inheritance and true transgenerational inheritance and, in the case of the latter, compare examples in which insertional mutations have driven the heritable epigenetic phenotype with examples of environmentally induced epigenetic inheritance for which the mechanism remains to be identified.

Abstract: Summary
Methods to isolate and culture primary prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells (PESCs) have proven difficult and ineffective. Here, we present a method to grow and expand both murine and human basal PESCs long term in serum- and feeder-free conditions. The method enriches for adherent mouse basal PESCs with a Lin−SCA-1+CD49f+TROP2high phenotype. Progesterone and sodium selenite are additionally required for the growth of human Lin−CD49f+TROP2high PESCs. The gene-expression profiles of expanded basal PESCs show similarities to ESCs, and NF-kB function is critical for epithelial differentiation of sphere-cultured PESCs. When transplanted in combination with urogenital sinus mesenchyme, expanded mouse and human PESCs generate ectopic prostatic tubules, demonstrating their stem cell activity in vivo. This novel method will facilitate the molecular, genomic, and functional characterization of normal and pathologic prostate glands of mouse and human origin.

Abstract: Levels of hepcidin, a key modulator of iron metabolism, are influenced by erythropoiesis, iron, and inflammation, all of which may be increased in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the variation in hepcidin level, and 2) the relative contribution of erythropoietic drive, iron, and inflammation to differences in hepcidin level in an adult cohort with SCD. In a prospective study, cross-sectional measurements of hepcidin, reticulocyte percentage, erythropoietin, ferritin, and high-sensitivity CRP were obtained. A regression tree analysis was used to measure the association between these interacting factors and hepcidin level. The cohort was comprised of 40 adults with SCD. Median age was 26years, 68% were female, and all had HbSS. Hepcidin values ranged from 30ng/ml to 326ng/ml, with a median of 87ng/ml. Regression tree analysis demonstrated that reticulocyte percentage, erythropoietin, ferritin and hs-CRP all were associated with hepcidin. The highest hepcidin values were found in subjects with low reticulocyte percentage and erythropoietin. In conclusion, erythropoietic drive, iron status, and inflammation all contribute to variation in hepcidin level. The strongest contributor is erythropoietic drive. Future studies could determine whether suppression of erythropoiesis with chronic transfusion influences hepcidin level.

Abstract: Establishment of cell polarity is essential for processes such as growth and division. In fission yeast, as well as other species, polarity factors travel at the ends of microtubules to cortical sites where they associate with the membrane and subsequently maintain a polarized activity pattern despite their ability to diffuse in the membrane. In this chapter we present methods to establish an in vitro system that captures the essential features of this process. This bottom-up approach allows us to identify the minimal molecular requirements for microtubule-based cell polarity. We employ microfabrication techniques combined with surface functionalization to create rigid chambers with affinity for proteins, as well as microfluidic techniques to create and shape emulsion droplets with functionalized lipid boundaries. Preliminary results are shown demonstrating that a properly organized microtubule cytoskeleton can be confined to these confined spaces, and proteins traveling at the ends of growing microtubules can be delivered to their boundaries.

Abstract: ORP3 is an R-Ras interacting oxysterol-binding protein homolog that regulates cell adhesion and is overexpressed in several cancers. We investigated here a novel function of ORP3 dependent on its targeting to both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM). Using biochemical and cell imaging techniques we demonstrate the mechanistic requirements for the subcellular targeting and function of ORP3 in control of R-Ras activity. We show that hyperphosphorylated ORP3 (ORP3-P) selectively interacts with the ER membrane protein VAPA, and ORP3–VAPA complexes are targeted to PM sites via the ORP3 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. A novel FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract)-like motif was identified in ORP3; only disruption of both the FFAT-like and canonical FFAT motif abolished the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) stimulated interaction of ORP3-P with VAPA. Co-expression of ORP3 and VAPA induced R-Ras activation, dependent on the interactions of ORP3 with VAPA and the PM. Consistently, downstream AktS473 phosphorylation and β1-integrin activity were enhanced by ORP3–VAPA. To conclude, phosphorylation of ORP3 controls its association with VAPA. Furthermore, we present evidence that ORP3–VAPA complexes stimulate R-Ras signaling.

Abstract: Plectin is the prototype of an intermediate filament (IF)-based cytolinker protein. It affects cells mechanically by interlinking and anchoring cytoskeletal filaments and acts as scaffolding and docking platform for signaling proteins to control cytoskeleton dynamics. The most common disease caused by mutations in the human plectin gene, epidermolysis bullosa simplex with muscular dystrophy (EBS-MD), is characterized by severe skin blistering and progressive muscular dystrophy. Therefore, we compared the biomechanical properties and the response to mechanical stress of murine plectin-deficient myoblasts and keratinocytes with wild-type cells. Using a cell stretching device, plectin-deficient myoblasts exhibited lower mechanical vulnerability upon external stress compared to wild-type cells, which we attributed to lower cellular pre-stress. Contrary to myoblasts, wild-type and plectin-deficient keratinocytes showed no significant differences. In magnetic tweezer measurements using fibronectin-coated paramagnetic beads, the stiffness of keratinocytes was higher than of myoblasts. Interestingly, cell stiffness, adhesion strength, and cytoskeletal dynamics were strikingly altered in plectin-deficient compared to wild-type myoblasts, whereas smaller differences were observed between plectin-deficient and wild-type keratinocytes, indicating that plectin might be more important for stabilizing cytoskeletal structures in myoblasts than in keratinocytes. Traction forces strongly correlated with the stiffness of plectin-deficient and wild-type myoblasts and keratinocytes. Contrary to that cell motility was comparable in plectin-deficient and wild-type myoblasts, but was significantly increased in plectin-deficient compared to wild-type keratinocytes. Thus, we postulate that the lack of plectin has divergent implications on biomechanical properties depending on the respective cell type.

Abstract: CXCR4 is the most common chemokine receptor expressed on tumor cells, and it is closely correlated with cancer cell stemness. This study was carried out to explore whether CXCR4 could function as a competitive endogenous RNA to promote metastasis, proliferation and survival in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We validated that CXCR4, together with TRAF6 and EGFR, was directly targeted by miR-146a in MCF-7 cells. Overexpression of CXCR4 3′UTR inhibited the activity of miR-146a, thus elevating the expression of CXCR4, TRAF6 and EGFR. These oncoproteins further activated NF-κB pathway and promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion and anti-apoptotic activity of MCF-7 cells. Collectively, our study provided new insights into the function of CXCR4 in breast cancer: it promotes tumor progression as both a protein-coding gene and a non-coding RNA, complicating the mechanism by which oncogenes promote tumor progression.

Abstract: Our previous studies have showed that tumor-derived autophagosomes (termed “DRibbles”) induce B cell activation, resulting in antibody production and cytokine secretion. Unexpectedly, we found that unfractionated splenocytes produced a higher level of antibody and cytokine than that of purified B cells. In the current study, we investigated the role of accessory cells in DRibbles-induced B cell activation. We found that cognate macrophages, but not T cells, significantly enhanced the B cell activities. Such an enhancement required cell–cell contact. Furthermore, DRibbles stimulation up-regulated CD40L expression on macrophages, resulting in increased level of CD40 expressed on B cells. The accessory role of macrophages in DRibbles-activated B cells is critically dependent on the CD40/CD40L interaction. In addition, the effects of macrophages were found to be largely dependent on TLR4 and MyD88 signaling pathway. Finally, our results showed that macrophages were able to enhance the antigen presentation function of B cells for specific T cell stimulation. Thus, these results suggest that macrophages play an important accessory role for DRibbles-induced B cell immune function.

Abstract: Worldwide malaria risk due to Plasmodium vivax makes development of vaccine against P. vivax, a high priority. Serine Repeat Antigen of P. vivax (PvSERA) is a multigene family of blood stage proteins with 12 homologues. Sequence diversity studies are important for understanding them as potential vaccine candidates. No information on N-terminal diversity of these genes is available in literature. In this paper, we evaluate the genetic polymorphism of N-terminal regions of the highly expressed member PvSERA4 and PvSERA5 genes from Indian field isolates. Our results show that PvSERA4 has deletions and insertions in Glutamine rich tetrameric repeat units contributing to its diversity. PvSERA5 also exhibits high genetic diversity with non-synonymous substitutions leading to identification of novel haplotypes from India. Our first report helps in elucidating the allelic variants of PvSERA genes in this region and contributes to evaluating their efficacy as vaccine candidates.

Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD), a hereditary hemolytic disorder is characterized by chronic hemolysis, oxidative stress, vaso-occlusion and end-organ damage. Hemolysis releases toxic cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) into circulation. Under physiologic conditions, plasma Hb binds to haptoglobin (Hp) and forms Hb–Hp dimers. The dimers bind to CD163 receptors on macrophages for further internalization and degradation. However, in SCD patients plasma Hp is depleted and free Hb is cleared primarily by proximal tubules of kidneys. Excess free Hb in plasma predisposes patients to renal damage. We hypothesized that administration of exogenous Hp reduces Hb-mediated renal damage. To test this hypothesis, human renal proximal tubular cells (HK-2) were exposed to HbA (50μM heme) for 24h. HbA increased the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme which degrades heme, reduces heme-mediated oxidative toxicity, and confers cytoprotection. Similarly, infusion of HbA (32μM heme/kg) induced HO-1 expression in kidneys of SCD mice. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the increased HO-1 expression in the proximal tubules of the kidney. Exogenous Hp attenuated the HbA-induced HO-1 expression in vitro and in SCD mice. Our results suggest that Hb-mediated oxidative toxicity may contribute to renal damage in SCD and that Hp treatment reduces heme/iron toxicity in the kidneys following hemolysis.

Abstract: Nodal modulator 1 (NOMO1), a highly conserved transmembrane protein, has been identified as a part of a protein complex that participates in the Nodal signaling pathway, a critical determinant of heart and visceral organ formation. We previously found that the NOMO1 gene was substantially downregulated in human ventricular septal defect (VSD) myocardium and, thus, may be an important molecular pathway in human heart development. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of NOMO1 gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) during early mouse cardiac differentiation using P19 cells as a model system. Our results revealed that the differentiated P19 cell population exhibited downregulated NOMO1 levels and expressed lower levels of Nodal signaling mediators, such as Nodal, Cripto and Smad2, than the negative control. Similarly, cardiomyocyte-specific sarcomeric markers, such as cardiac troponin T, as well as expression of cardiogenesis-related transcriptional factors, such as Nkx2.5, Gata4 and Tbx5 were found to be downregulated in P19 differentiated cardiomyocytes in NOMO1-silenced cells when compared to controls. In conclusion, our results indicate that NOMO1 gene knockdown inhibits the differentiation of P19 cells into cardiomyocytes, which highlights a potential role for NOMO1 in early cardiogenesis.

Abstract: Invadopodia are specialized actin-based microdomains of the plasma membrane that combine adhesive properties with matrix degrading activities. Proper functioning of the bone, immune, and vascular systems depend on these organelles, and their relevance in cancer cells is linked to tumor metastasis. The elucidation of the mechanisms driving invadopodia formation is a prerequisite to understanding their role and ultimately to controlling their functions. Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2) was reported to suppress tumor cell migration and metastasis. However, the mechanism of action of SATB2 is unknown. Here, we show that SATB2 inhibits invadopodia formation in HCT116 cells and that the molecular scaffold palladin is inhibited by exogenous expression of SATB2. To confirm this association, we elucidated the function of palladin in HCT116 using a knock down strategy. Palladin knock down reduced cell migration and invasion and inhibited invadopodia formation. This phenotype was confirmed by a rescue experiment. We then demonstrated that palladin expression in SATB2-expressing cells restored invasion and invadopodia formation. Our results showed that SATB2 action is mediated by palladin inhibition and the SATB2/palladin pathway is associated with invadopodia formation in colorectal cancer cells.

In the present study, 5 subjects (P1–P5) with BMTCP whose platelet counts ranged between 36140X109/l and mean platelet volume (MPV)13.5–16.1fl were analyzed for differential gene expression of platelets by suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) technique. Four genes i.e. myotubularin related protein 9 (MTMR9), iron responsive element binding protein 2 (IREB2), alpha tubulin(TUBA) and tyrosine kinase ligand (TKL) were found to be differentially expressed in patient platelets as compared to that of normal healthy controls which was further confirmed by quantitative RT PCR analysis. The study highlights a multi-factorial etiology for BMTCP which is widely prevalent in the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent.

Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of endocytosis and trafficking of nanoparticles through endothelial and epithelial barriers leads potentially to improved efficacy of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems. Detailed characterizations of cell models with respect to endocytic pathway expression and activity (endocytic profiling) should facilitate data interpretation. We performed endocytic profiling of CaCo-2 and hCMEC/D3 cell lines, widely used as human intestinal and blood–brain barrier permeability models, respectively, during cell differentiation. Furthermore, we compared endocytic profiles of cell lines with those of primary cells. Expression of genes involved in specific endocytic pathways was analyzed at mRNA levels by quantitative real time PCR. Where possible, the respective protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting, and endocytic activities of cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. We showed that differentiated CaCo-2 cells formed tight, well polarized monolayers with reduced endocytic activity accompanied by reduced mRNA expression of most of the endocytosis-related genes. In contrast, hCMEC/D3 cells formed a leaky, less polarized barrier, and in vitro differentiation had little effect on either the expression of endocytosis-related genes or endocytic activity of these cells. Endocytic profiling of in vitro models and comparison with primary cells is an important measure to avoid misleading conclusions in nanoparticle permeation studies.

Abstract: Building cells from their component parts will hinge upon our ability to reconstitute biochemical compartmentalization and exchange between membrane-delimited organelles. By contrast with our understanding of other cellular events, the mechanisms that govern membrane trafficking has lagged because the presence of phospholipid bilayers complicates the use of standard methods. This chapter describes in vitro methods for purifying, reconstituting, and visualizing membrane remodeling activities directly by electron cryomicroscopy.

Abstract: FLNa is a ubiquitous cytoskeletal protein that links transmembrane receptors, including integrins, to F-actin and functions as a signalling intermediate. We investigated FLNa's role in the function of integrin-type collagen receptors, EGF-EGFR signalling and regulation of PKB/Akt and ERK1/2. Using FLNa-deficient M2 human melanoma cells, and same cells expressing EGFP-FLNa (M2F) or its Ig-like repeats 1-8+24, 8-15+24 and 16-24, we found that in M2F and M2 8-15+24 cells, EGF induced the increased phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and ERK1/2. In M2F cells EGF induced the localisation of these kinases to cell nucleus and lamellipodia, respectively, and the ERK1/2 phosphorylation-dependent co-immunoprecipitation of FLNa with ERK1/2. Only M2F and M2 8-15+24 cells adhered to and spread on type I collagen whereas on fibronectin all cells behaved similarly. α1β1 and α2β1 were the integrin-type collagen receptors expressed on these cells with primarily α1β1 localising to focal contacts and affecting cell adhesion and migration in a manner dependent on FLNa or its Ig-like repeats 8-15. Our results suggest a role for FLNa repeats 8-15 in the α1-subunit-dependent regulation of integrin α1β1 function, EGF-EGFR signalling to PKB/Akt and ERK1/2, identify ERK1/2 in EGF-induced FLNa-associated protein complexes, and show that the function of different integrins is subjected to differential regulation by FLNa.

Abstract: The neonatal heart is a very useful tool for the study of biochemical pathways and properties of cardiomyocytes and as it has the potential to regenerate for a brief period of time from birth; it is also useful to study cardiac regeneration. However, as the heart matures, this proficiency for regeneration is reduced. This regenerative potential may be influenced by the microenvironment of the heart in the early stages of postnatal development and therefore, cell cultures derived at this stage may contain functional cardiomyocytes and progenitor cells. The aim of this study was to identify key steps in the isolation and culture of such early stage—neonatal mouse hearts to allow maximum migration of cardiomyocytes from the explant and their maintenance as functional, long term cultures. Explant cultures of mouse ventricles preserved 3-dimensional structure and generated migrating layers of cardiomyocytes that expressed alpha sarcomeric actin which could be further sub-cultured by enzymatic dissociation. Western blotting demonstrated expression of c-KIT, GATA4, alpha sarcomeric actin and connexin43 proteins after 20 days of explant culture. ACTA1, GATA4, and CX43 continued to express in five weeks old explant cultures while the c-KIT protein was expressed up to two passages during sub-culture. Real time PCR and SQRT PCR also demonstrated gene expression of cardiomyocyte markers in long term cultures. Migrating cells from the explants assembled into contracting spheroids after subculture and expressed the c-KIT protein. Progenitor markers CD44, CD90, and extracellular proteins, periostin and vimentin demonstrated the preservation of cellular heterogeneity in such cultures. Supplementation with Hydrocortisone maintained a cardioprotective environment and reduced the non-myocyte population. This is an optimized and efficient method for the generation of neonatal heart cultures that is not labor intensive and does not require supplementation with cytokines.

Abstract: Rab GTPases are master regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking along endocytic and exocytic pathways. In this chapter, we began to characterize the exocytic and recycling Rabs from the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) that causes the rice blast disease. Among the 11 putative Rabs identified from the M. oryzae genome database (MoRabs), MoRab1, MoRab8, and MoRab11 appear orthologs of mammalian Rab1, Rab8, and Rab11 and likely function in exocytosis and endosomal recycling. To test this contention, we cloned, expressed, and determined intracellular localization of the three MoRabs in mammalian cells, in comparison to their human counterparts (hRabs). The MoRabs were well expressed as GFP fusion proteins and colocalized with the tdTomato-labeled hRabs on exocytic and recycling organelles, as determined by immunoblot analysis and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The colocalization supports the contention that the MoRabs are indeed Rab orthologs and may play important roles in the development and pathogenicity of M. oryzae.

Abstract: Cells have an amazing ability to self-organize and rearrange their interiors. Such morphology changes are essential to cell development, division, and motility. The core of a cell's internal organization lies with the cytoskeleton made of both microtubule and actin filaments with their associated proteins and ATP-utilizing enzymes. Despite years of in vitro reconstitution experiments, we still do not fully understand how the cytoskeleton can self-organize. In an attempt to create a simple system of self-organization, we have used a simple filament-gliding assay to examine how kinesin-1-driven motion of microtubules can generate cell-like organization in the presence of excess filaments and antiparallel cross-linkers.

Abstract: Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare heterogeneous disease characterized by pancytopenia and hypoplastic bone marrow. The incidence is 2–3/million inhabitants/year, in Europe, but higher in East Asia. Survival in severe aplastic anemia (SAA) has markedly improved in the past 2decades because of advances in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, immunosuppressive and biologic drugs, and supportive care. In SAA hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from a matched sibling donor (MSD) is the treatment of choice. If a MSD is not available, the options include immunosuppressive therapy (IST) or unrelated donor HSCT. The objective of this guideline is to provide healthcare professionals with clear guidance on the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients with AA. A preliminary, evidence-based document issued by a group of pediatric hematologists was discussed, modified and approved during a series of “Consensus Conferences” according to procedures previously validated by the AIEOP Board. The guidelines highlight the importance of referring pediatric patients with AA to pediatric centers with long experience in diagnosis, differential diagnosis, management, supportive care and follow-up of AA.

Abstract: The ADP ribosylation factor (Arf) family of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) regulates vesicular transport at several locations within the cell, and is in turn regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) via a conserved catalytic domain, termed the Sec7 domain. The catalytic activity of the Sec7 domain is well characterized in the context of a few GEFs acting at the periphery of the cell. This chapter describes the techniques used to extend the biochemical analysis of activity to the much larger GEFs acting on the Arf family in the core secretory pathway, using the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec7 on Arf1, regulating export from the trans-Golgi network, as a model. The complete methods for purification to near homogeneity of all proteins required, including several Sec7 constructs and multiple relevant small GTPases, are detailed. These are followed by methods for the quantification of the nucleotide exchange activity of Sec7 in a physiologically relevant context, including modifications required to dissect the signal integration functions of Sec7 as an effector of several other small GTPases, and methods for identifying stable Sec7–small GTPase interactions in the presence of membranes. These techniques may be extended to the analysis of similar members of the Sec7 GEF subfamily in other species and acting elsewhere in the secretory pathway.

Abstract: The integration of the several clinical and laboratory dimensions and the influence of each parameter on the sickle cell disease (SCD)-related mortality is useful for predicting the phenotype of an individual. This study evaluated the feasibility of the SCD severity calculator use to measure disease severity in Brazilian patients. The study group was composed of 500 SCD patients (440 HbSS and 60 HbSC) diagnosed by molecular biology. We observed a decrease in severity scores in 72 SCD patients assessed before and after the hydroxyurea (HU) use. Furthermore, the HU influenced the increase of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and HbF concentration, and the decrease of leukocytes and total bilirubin. We found 180 (36.0%) patients with intermediate phenotype, 170 (34.0%) mild phenotype and 150 (30.0%) with severe phenotype. Patients with ages >40years had higher mean score (0.778±0.177) than patients between 18 and 40years (0.562±0.152) and patients between 5 and 17years (0.322±0.145). We observe that there is a tendency of individuals with leg ulcers, avascular necrosis and cardiac complications with increasing age. Correlation analysis showed relations between severity scores with leukocytes, reticulocytes, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, HbS, hemoglobin and hematocrit (p<0.05). Several comparisons involving age groups, SCD genotype and phenotypic classification had satisfactory results and this classification will be used for future studies involving genetic polymorphisms, response to treatment with HU and oxidative stress markers in SCD.

Abstract: Numerous studies associate genetic markers with iron- and erythrocyte-related parameters, but few relate them to iron-clinical phenotypes. Novel SNP rs1375515, located in a subunit of the calcium channel gene CACNA2D3, is associated with a higher risk of anaemia. The aim of this study is to further investigate the association of this SNP with iron-related parameters and iron-clinical phenotypes, and to explore the potential role of calcium channel subunit region in iron regulation. Furthermore, we aim to replicate the association of other SNPs reported previously in our population. We tested 45 SNPs selected via systematic review and fine mapping of CACNA2D3 region, with haematological and biochemical traits in 358 women of reproductive age. Multivariate analyses include back-step logistic regression and decision trees. The results replicate the association of SNPs with iron-related traits, and also confirm the protective effect of both A allele of rs1800562 (HFE) and G allele of rs4895441 (HBS1L-MYB). The risk of developing anaemia is increased in reproductive age women carriers of A allele of rs1868505 (CACNA2D3) and/or T allele of rs13194491 (HIST1H2BJ). Association of SNPs from fine mapping with ferritin and serum iron suggests that calcium channels could be a potential pathway for iron uptake in physiological conditions.

Abstract: Optimal single particle tracking experiments in live cells requires small and photostable probes, which do not modify the behavior of the molecule of interest. Current fluorescence-based microscopy of single molecules and nanoparticles is often limited by bleaching and blinking or by the probe size. As an alternative, we present in this chapter the synthesis of a small and highly specific gold nanoprobe whose detection is based on its absorption properties. We first present a protocol to synthesize 5-nm-diameter gold nanoparticles and functionalize them with a nanobody, a single-domain antibody from camelid, targeting the widespread green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins with a high affinity. Then we describe how to detect and track these individual gold nanoparticles in live cell using photothermal imaging microscopy. The combination of a probe with small size, perfect photostability, high specificity, and versatility through the vast existing library of GFP-proteins, with a highly sensitive detection technique enables long-term tracking of proteins with minimal hindrance in confined and crowded environments such as intracellular space.

Abstract: Centrosomes act as the main microtubule-organizing centre of animal cells and play critical roles in the cell, such as mitotic spindle organization, cell polarity, and motility. They are composed of two barrel-shaped structures, the centrioles, surrounded by the pericentriolar matrix. In mammalian cells, the two centrioles differ structurally due to generational difference, the oldest one bearing appendages which allow the transient docking of the centriole at the plasma membrane in order to grow a primary cilium. Centrosome components are highly conserved throughout evolution and several pathologies have been associated with centrosomal defects. The understanding of such a complex organelle has therefore been a challenge for many researchers and has led to the development of centrosomal purification procedures to assess molecular composition, biological function, and structural organization of centrosomes. In this paper, we detail a step-by-step procedure to generate high yield of purified centrosome obtained from various mammalian cell lines.

Abstract: Background
Severe burn results in irreversible damage to eccrine sweat glands, for which no effective treatment is available. Interaction between the extracellular matrix and epithelial cells is critical for proper three-dimensional organization and function of the epithelium.Methods: Matrigel-embedded eccrine sweat gland cells were subcutaneously implanted into the inguinal regions of nude mice. Two weeks later, the Matrigel plugs were removed and evaluated for series of detection items.Results: Sweat gland cells developed into sweat gland-like structures in the Matrigel plugs based on: (1) de novo formation of tubular-like structures with one or more hollow lumens, (2) expression of epithelial and sweat gland markers (pancytokeratin, CK5/7/14/19, α–SMA and CEA), (3) basement membrane formation, (4) myoepithelial cells presenting in and encompassing the tubular-like structures, (5) cellular polarization, evident by the expression of tight junction proteins (claudin-1 and ZO-2), anchoring junctions (desmoglein-1 and -2 and E-cadherin) and CEA in the luminal membrane, (6) expression of proteins related to sweat secretion and absorption (Na+–K+–ATPase α/β, Na+–K+–2Cl-cotranspoter 1, Na+/H+ exchanger 1, aquaporin-5, epithelial sodium channel, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, potassium channel and vacuolar-type H+-ATPase), and (7) about 20% of the tubular-like structures are de novo coils and 80% are de novo ducts.Conclusions: This study provides not only an excellent model to study eccrine sweat gland development, cytodifferentiation and reconstitution, but also an in vivo model for regeneration of eccrine sweat glands.

Abstract: Eisosomes are plasma membrane-associated protein complexes organizing the membrane compartment of Can1 (MCC), a membrane microdomain of specific structure and function in ascomycetous fungi. By heterologous expression of specific components of Schizosaccharomyces pombe eisosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae we reconstitute structures exhibiting the composition and morphology of S. pombe eisosome in the host plasma membrane. We show S. pombe protein Pil1 (SpPil1) to substitute the function of its S. cerevisiae homologue in building plasma membrane-associated assemblies recognized by inherent MCC/eisosome constituents Sur7 and Seg1. Our data indicate that binding of SpPil1 to the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae also induces formation of furrow-like invaginations characteristic for MCC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of interspecies transfer of a functional plasma membrane microdomain. In the described system, we identify a striking difference between eisosome stabilizer proteins Seg1 and SpSle1. While Seg1 recruits both Pil1 and SpPil1 to the plasma membrane, SpSle1 recognizes only its natural counterpart, SpPil1. In the presence of Pil1, SpSle1 is segregated outside the Pil1-organized eisosomes and forms independent microdomains in the host membrane.

Abstract: α-thalassemia X-linked mental retardation syndrome is a rare inherited intellectual disability disorder due to mutations in the ATRX gene. In our previous study of the prevalence of β-thalassemia mutations in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, we confirmed the widespread coinheritance of α-thalassemia mutation. Some of these subjects have a family history of mental retardation, the cause of which is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the presence or absence of mutations in the ATRX gene in these patients. Three exons of the ATRX gene and their flanking regions were directly sequenced. Only four female transfusion dependent β-thalassemia patients were found to be carriers of a novel mutation in the ATRX gene. Two of the ATRX gene mutations, c.623delA and c.848T>C were present in patients homozygous for IVS I-5(G→C) and homozygous for Cd39(C→T) β-thalassemia mutation, respectively. While the other two that were located in the intronic region (flanking regions), were present in patients homozygous for Cd39(C→T) β-thalassemia mutation. The two subjects with the mutations in the coding region had family members with mental retardation, which suggests that the novel frame shift mutation and the missense mutation at coding region of ATRX gene are involved in ATRX syndrome.

Abstract: Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is an active compound extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Chuanxiong. Previously, we have shown that TMP induces human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell differentiation toward the neuronal phenotype by targeting topoisomeraseIIβ (TopoIIβ), a protein implicated in neural development. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate whether the transcriptional factors specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), in addition to the upstream signaling pathways ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt, are involved in modulating TopoIIβ expression in the neuronal differentiation process. We demonstrated that SH-SY5Y cells treated with TMP (80μM) terminally differentiated into neurons, characterized by increased neuronal markers, tubulin βIII and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2), and increased neurite outgrowth, with no negative effect on cell survival. TMP also increased the expression of TopoIIβ, which was accompanied by increased expression of Sp1 in the differentiated neuron-like cells, whereas NF-Y protein levels remained unchanged following the differentiation progression. We also found that the phosphorylation level of Akt, but not ERK1/2, was significantly increased as a result of TMP stimulation. Furthermore, as established by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway increased Sp1 binding to the promoter of the TopoIIβ gene. Blockage of PI3K/Akt was shown to lead to subsequent inhibition of TopoIIβ expression and neuronal differentiation. Collectively, the results indicate that the PI3K/Akt/Sp1/TopoIIβ signaling pathway is necessary for TMP-induced neuronal differentiation. Our findings offer mechanistic insights into understanding the upstream regulation of TopoIIβ in neuronal differentiation, and suggest potential applications of TMP both in neuroscience research and clinical practice to treat relevant diseases of the nervous system.

Abstract: There is a long-standing unmet clinical need for biomarkers with high specificity for distributed stem cells (DSCs) in tissues, or for use in diagnostic and therapeutic cell preparations (e.g., bone marrow). Although DSCs are essential for tissue maintenance and repair, accurate determination of their numbers for medical applications has been problematic. Previous searches for biomarkers expressed specifically in DSCs were hampered by difficulty obtaining pure DSCs and by the challenges in mining complex molecular expression data. To identify such useful and specific DSC biomarkers, we combined a novel sparse feature selection method with combinatorial molecular expression data focused on asymmetric self-renewal, a conspicuous property of DSCs. The analysis identified reduced expression of the histone H2A variant H2A.Z as a superior molecular discriminator for DSC asymmetric self-renewal. Subsequent molecular expression studies showed H2A.Z to be a novel “pattern-specific biomarker” for asymmetrically self-renewing cells, with sufficient specificity to count asymmetrically self-renewing DSCs in vitro and potentially in situ.

Abstract: Cell division in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is commonly initiated by the well-controlled binding of proteins to the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane. However, a precise characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of membrane-bound proteins is often difficult to achieve in vivo. Here, we present protocols for the use of supported lipid bilayers to rebuild the cytokinetic machineries of cells with greatly different dimensions: the bacterium Escherichia coli and eggs of the vertebrate Xenopus laevis. Combined with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, these experimental setups allow for precise quantitative analyses of membrane-bound proteins. The protocols described to obtain glass-supported membranes from bacterial and vertebrate lipids can be used as starting points for other reconstitution experiments. We believe that similar biochemical assays will be instrumental to study the biochemistry and biophysics underlying a variety of complex cellular tasks, such as signaling, vesicle trafficking, and cell motility.

Abstract: Multiple lines of evidence implicate that aberrant activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is involved in a variety of human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying how cancer cells respond to Hh inhibition remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that blockade of Hh signaling suppresses cell proliferation in human cancer cells. Microarray analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in human cancer cells are enriched in autophagy pathway in response to the inhibition of Hh signaling. Interestingly, inhibition of Hh signaling induced autophagy, whereas activation of Hh signaling by ligand treatments prevented the induction of autophagy. In addition, inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) partially suppressed cytotoxicity induced by inhibition of Hh signaling. Finally, in autophagy deficient cells, cytotoxic effect triggered by inhibition of Hh signaling was partially reversed, indicating the modulation of autophagy by Hh signaling is autophagy-specific. These results suggest that inhibition of Hh signaling impedes cancer cell proliferation in part through induction of autophagy.

Abstract: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by a hypercoagulable state associated with acute hemolysis. Eculizumab is used to reduce the intensity of intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients. The hemostatic status of three patients with PNH was assessed during eculizumab treatment by D-dimer assay and the global assays: thromboelastography (TEG), thrombin generation test (TGТ), and thrombodynamics (TD). In the state of hemolytic crisis before the therapy D-dimer concentration was increased in two patients accompanied by hypercoagulation changes in TEG parameter angle (α). TD parameter the clot growth velocity (V) revealed hypercoagulability while TGT parameter ETP was within the normal range in all patients. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity decreased during the 8months of eculizumab therapy. The physical health was improved, the frequency of hemolytic crisis decreased. Patients periodically exhibited hypercoagulable state: the mean values α=38±11° (with normal range 20–40°), ETP=1311±442nM·min (with normal range 800–1560nM·min), V=31±4μm/min (with normal range 20–29μm/min). During the eculizumab therapy two patients had the repeated clinical manifestation of acute hemolytic crisis, the parameters of the global tests were increased compared to the previous measurement. The global hemostasis tests TEG, TGT and TD revealed hypercoagulability in patients with PNH during eculizumab therapy.

Abstract: Purpose
Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type-I (LAD-I) is caused by mutations in the ITGB2 gene, encoding the β2-subunit of β2-integrin (CD18) which leads to markedly reduced expression of CD18 on leukocytes resulting into recurrent life threatening infections. Here we aim to identify the molecular defects underlying LAD-I in Indian patients and correlate with the clinical presentation.
Methods
Blood was collected from 30 patients and their parents for absolute neutrophil count, expression of CD18 and CD11 by flow cytometry and DNA extraction. PCR and DNA sequencing of the ITGB2 gene was done for mutation characterization.
Results
Phenotypically, 22 patients were LAD-I0, 1 was LAD-I− and 7 were LAD-I+ showing no expression and reduced expression of CD18 respectively. Nine novel mutations in 15 patients and 11 known mutations in 16 patients were detected. Prenatal diagnosis was performed for 5 families.
Conclusion
In this study 30 patients were phenotypically and genotypically evaluated for a less known disease LAD-I. Unavailability of curative options to majority of the patients and high cost of supportive care emphasize the need to increase awareness about a suspicious case so that timely management can be given to the patient and prenatal diagnosis can be offered to their families.

Abstract: Niemann–Pick disease type C (NPC) is an atypical neurovisceral lysosomal storage disorder resulting from mutations in either the NPC1 or the NPC2 gene, currently conceived as a lipid trafficking disorder. Impaired egress of cholesterol from the late endosomal/lysosomal (LE/L) compartment is a key element of the pathogenesis. The resulting accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in the LE/L compartment can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy after staining with filipin. The “filipin test,” performed on cultured fibroblasts, is the historical gold standard method to establish the diagnosis in patients. The authors provide methodological details of the protocol developed and used in their laboratory since 1988, in which two sources of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (total serum and pure LDL) are used in parallel to facilitate the final interpretation. Methodological caveats and variability of patterns encountered in patients with proven Niemann–Pick C disease (typical “classic” or “intermediate,” atypical “variant”) are described. An overview of the past 5years referrals (533 subjects tested, 57 NPC cases, but also 74 mildly/weakly positive tests not due to NPC) is discussed, leading to a proposed algorithm for interpretation of results in the filipin test. This tool takes into account the limits of the method. In up to 15% of all referrals, the filipin test was inconclusive in absence of molecular analysis. Patients diagnosed in the adult age preferentially showed an “intermediate” or “variant” pattern. Well conducted, the filipin test remains an efficient approach for diagnosing NPC, and it is a good functional test to study the pathogenicity of novel mutations.

Abstract: Aim of this study was to compare plasma levels of the secreted protein Klotho in β-thalassemia major patients and in healthy controls. Also, we examined the existence of correlations between the protein level and osteoporosis, poor muscle strength and fractures. A total of 106 patients with β-thalassemia major and 95 healthy blood donors were enrolled. Klotho level in plasma was measured by mean of an ELISA test and the hand-grip strength using a dynamometer. Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxy vitamin D (Vitamin D), serum calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ferritin, creatinine were measured by standard clinical techniques. DXA was used to measure bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (L2–L4), femoral neck and total hip. We found that the Klotho protein concentration was lower in the blood of patients with β-thalassemia major than in healthy controls, and it was directly correlated to the hand-grip strength. In β-thalassemia major patients, the secreted Klotho was lower than in healthy controls. The preliminary investigation into the correlation between markers of osteo- and sarco-penia and Klotho demonstrated a decreased Klotho concentration in β-TM patients and a higher probability of having had fragility fractures.

Abstract: Development of the antimalarial drug resistant strains has currently become a major public health challenge. There is an urgent need to develop new antimalarial drugs. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are receiving increasing attention as anticancer therapy. It has revolutionarised the management of CML to say the least. TKIs are also increasingly being implicated in complicated but vital life cycle of malaria parasite. Hence we tested two commonly used but different classes of TKIs (imatinib and sorafenib) in-vitro for their antimalarial activity and possible synergistic activity with existing antimalarial drug. Antimalarial activity was tested with the help of modified WHO microtest technique in-vitro for five different Plasmodium falciparum laboratory strains (3D7, Dd2, 7G8, MRC2, PKL9). Imatinib and sorafenib showed a promising antimalarial activity with all the strains. These compounds caused dose dependent inhibition of parasite maturation. The isobologram analysis of the interactions of these TKIs with standard antimalarial drug, artesunate revealed distinct patterns of synergism, additivity and antagonism at different ratios. Imatinib showed worthwhile synergism with artesunate indicating imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors may have significant antimalarial activity and can be used in combination therapy.

Abstract: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare potentially fatal syndrome characterized by an uncontrolled hyperinflammatory response. The secondary form of HLH is usually triggered by a causative agent. Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a rare trigger of secondary HLH. We present a case series of five adolescents and adults diagnosed with Ehrlichia-induced HLH and we discuss their clinical and laboratory findings. We also review the literature for similar cases. Between October 2003 and June 2014, we identified 76 cases of HLH in adolescents and adults, 5 of which were induced by Ehrlichia. All 5 patients had fever, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, and high ferritin. Hyperferritinemia was striking with a median admission ferritin of 47,290 μg/L (range: 2,863-85,517). In addition to the positive Ehrlichia PCR testing on peripheral blood of all patients, two patients with neurologic symptoms tested positive for E. chaffeensis in CSF specimens. Early treatment with doxycycline was effective. After a median follow up of 7.3 months, all patients were alive and none had recurrence of HLH. Clinicians should consider E. chaffeensis as a potential trigger for HLH especially in areas with tick activity. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with doxycycline are required for a better outcome.

Abstract: Cyclase associated protein (CAP) is a highly conserved protein with roles in actin dynamics and many cellular processes. Two isoforms exist in higher eukaryotes, CAP1 and CAP2. CAP1 is ubiquitously expressed whereas CAP2 shows restricted tissue distribution. In mice, ablation of CAP2 leads to development of cardiomyopathy. CAP2 is expressed in skin. In human skin its expression is increased in wounds. To elucidate the role of CAP2 in skin upon injury, we studied the wound healing in CAP2 deficient mice and found altered wound healing response presumably resulting from reduced levels of α-SMA, decreased macrophage infiltration and slower neovascularization. In vitro cultured Cap2 deficient keratinocytes showed reduced velocity and a delay in scratch closure. The analysis of primary mutant fibroblasts also showed reduced velocity and less contractibility. They had extended protrusions and more focal adhesions. In addition the F-actin content was increased keeping the total actin content unaltered. Mutant fibroblasts furthermore exhibited an altered response during recovery from drug-induced disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, CAP1 was upregulated in knockout unwounded skin and in wounds which might partially compensate for the loss of CAP2. Taken together, our studies reveal a role for CAP2 in wound healing which may be based on its function as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Invadopodia are actin-driven membrane protrusions that show oscillatory assembly and disassembly causing matrix degradation to support invasion and dissemination of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Profilin1, an actin and phosphoinositide binding protein, is downregulated in several adenocarcinomas and it is been shown that its depletion enhances invasiveness and motility of breast cancer cells by increasing PI(3,4)P2 levels at the leading edge. In this study, we show for the first time that depletion of profilin1 leads to an increase in the number of mature invadopodia and these assemble and disassemble more rapidly than in control cells. Previous work by Sharma et al. (2013a), has shown that the binding of the protein Tks5 with PI(3,4)P2 confers stability to the invadopodium precursor causing it to mature into a degradation-competent structure. We found that loss of profilin1 expression increases the levels of PI(3,4)P2 at the invadopodium and as a result, enhances recruitment of the interacting adaptor Tks5. The increased PI(3,4)P2–Tks5 interaction accelerates the rate of invadopodium anchorage, maturation, and turnover. Our results indicate that profilin1 acts as a molecular regulator of the levels of PI(3,4)P2 and Tks5 recruitment in invadopodia to control the invasion efficiency of invadopodia.

Abstract: The activity of the erythroid-specific isoenzyme of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS2), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis, is down-regulated during iron-deficiency. Ferrochelatase (FECH), the last enzyme of this pathway, inserts iron into protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) to form heme. Patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), an inherited deficiency in FECH, often show signs of iron deficiency in addition to phototoxicity which is caused by PPIX accumulation. However, iron supplementation often leads to exacerbation of phototoxicity. We report three EPP patients who had reduced erythrocytic PPIX concentrations when they were iron-deficient and their microcytic and hypochromic anemia deteriorated. Additionally, we found a significant increase in the amount of ALAS2 mRNA and protein among EPP patients. To verify the connection between FECH deficiency and ALAS2 over-expression, we inhibited FECH in cultured cells and found a subsequent increase in ALAS2 mRNA. We conclude that the primary deficiency in ferrochelatase leads to a secondary increase in ALAS2 expression. The combined action of these two enzymes within the heme biosynthetic pathway contributes to the accumulation of PPIX. Furthermore, we hypothesize that EPP patients may benefit from a mild iron deficiency since it would limit PPIX production by restricting ALAS2 over-expression.

Abstract: During development, normal functioning, as well as in certain pathological conditions, cells are influenced not only by biochemical but also by mechanical signals. Over the past two decades, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has become one of the key tools to investigate the mechanical properties and interactions of biological samples. AFM studies have provided important insights into the role of mechanical signaling in different biological processes. In this chapter, we introduce different applications of AFM-based force measurements, from experimental setup and sample preparation to data acquisition and analysis, with a special focus on nervous system mechanics. Combined with other microscopy techniques, AFM is a powerful tool to reveal novel information about molecular, cell, and tissue mechanics.

Abstract: A majority of messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) in the higher eukaryotes undergo alternative splicing to generate more than one mature product. By targeting the open reading frame region this process increases diversity of protein isoforms beyond the nominal coding capacity of the genome. However, alternative splicing also frequently controls output levels and spatiotemporal features of cellular and organismal gene expression programs. Here we discuss how these non-coding functions of alternative splicing contribute to development through regulation of mRNA stability, translational efficiency and cellular localization.

Abstract: Members of the INhibitor of Growth (ING) family of proteins act as readers of the epigenetic code through specific recognition of the trimethylated form of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4Me3) by their plant homeodomains. The founding member of the family, ING1, was initially identified as a tumor suppressor with altered regulation in a variety of cancer types. While alterations in ING1 and ING4 levels have been reported in a variety of cancer types, little is known regarding ING3 protein levels in normal or transformed cells due to a lack of reliable immunological tools. In this study we present the characterization of a new monoclonal antibody we have developed against ING3 that specifically recognizes human and mouse ING3. The antibody works in western blots, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry. Using this antibody we show that ING3 is most highly expressed in small intestine, bone marrow and epidermis, tissues in which cells undergo rapid proliferation and renewal. Consistent with this observation, we show that ING3 is expressed at significantly higher levels in proliferating versus quiescent epithelial cells. These data suggest that ING3 levels may serve as a surrogate for growth rate, and suggest possible roles for ING3 in growth and self renewal and related diseases such as cancer.

Vaso-constrictive and vaso-dilatory molecules have been hypothesized to play a role in VOEs. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor that is released during VOEs and is correlated with pain history. Apelin is a vaso-dilatory peptide that also has a modulatory role in pain processing. We hypothesize that the ratio between vaso-dilatory and vaso-constrictive tone in children with SCD may be a marker of pain sensitization and vaso-occlusion. Plasma endothelin and apelin levels were measured in 47 children with SCD. Procedural pain and baseline pain were assessed via child- and caregiver-reports and observational distress. Pain history was assessed using retrospective chart review. Plasma apelin was related to age, with decreased levels in older children. The ratio between apelin and ET-1 was negatively correlated to observational baseline pain. The ratio between apelin and Big ET was negatively correlated to caregiver ratings of baseline pain and positively correlated to history of VOEs, which is possibly due to hydroxyurea treatment. These results suggest that an imbalance in the apelin and endothelin systems may contribute to an increasing number of VOEs and baseline pain in children with SCD.

Abstract: Phenotypic resistance to APC is a complex mechanism associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis in women with recurrent spontaneous abortions. The primary aim of this prospective case control study was to find out the frequencies of different congenital and acquired thrombophilic factors predisposing to APC resistance and to evaluate the strength of their association with recurrent pregnancy losses. FV Leiden accounted for around 40% of all APCR positive patients and the difference in the group frequencies compared with controls, was found to be statistically significant (p=0.001). 18.33% (11/60) FV Leiden-negative APC-resistant patients had FVIII:c values exceeding 95th percentile of the control population (145IU/dL), as compared to 3% in the control group (p=0.001). Mean FVIII level in control subjects was 118±14.0IUdL−, compared with 127.7±31.2IUdL− in the patient group (p=0.009). Apart from FVIII, only the anti-phospholipid antibodies showed a statistically significant association with APCR phenotype (p=0.028), unlike other thrombophilic factors such as Protein C, Protein S, FV levels, HR2 haplotype or other rarer FV variants. The strong positive association of FVL mutation, anti-phospholipid antibodies and elevated FVIII levels with APCR phenotype calls for incorporating them as first line investigations in patients with recurrent spontaneous miscarriages with APCR positivity.

Abstract: Purpose
We compared the gene expression profile of peripheral blood CD34+ cells and granulocytes in subjects with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), with the accent on signaling pathways affected by BCR–ABL oncogene.
Methods
The microarray analyses have been performed in circulating CD34+ cells and granulocytes from peripheral blood of 7 subjects with CML and 7 healthy donors. All studied BCR–ABL positive CML patients were in chronic phase, with a mean value of 2012±SD of CD34+cells/μl in peripheral blood.
Results
The gene expression profile was more prominent in CML CD34+ cells (3553 genes) compared to granulocytes (2701 genes). The 41 and 39 genes were significantly upregulated in CML CD34+ cells (HINT1, TXN, SERBP1) and granulocytes, respectively. BCR–ABL oncogene activated PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling through significant upregulation of PTPN11, CDK4/6, and MYC and reduction of E2F1, KRAS, and NFKBIA gene expression in CD34+ cells. Among genes linked to the inhibition of cellular proliferation by BCR–ABL inhibitor Imatinib, the FOS and STAT1 demonstrated significantly decreased expression in CML.
Conclusion
The presence of BCR–ABL fusion gene doubled the expression quantity of genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle, proliferation and apoptosis of CD34+ cells. These results determined the modified genes in PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling of CML subjects.

Abstract: Background
The aim of this study was to evaluate the monocyte chemoatractant protein-1 (MCP-1) as a novel biomarker of renal lesion in sickle cell disease (SCD) and correlate it with oxidative stress.
Methods
This is a prospective study with SCD patients followed at a tertiary center in Brazil. Urine samples were collected to dosage of protein, MCP-1, malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary creatinine. Patients taking hydroxyurea (SSHU) were compared to those not taking the drug (SS). Patients' data were also compared to a control group of 15 healthy blood donors.
Results
MCP-1 dosage was increased in SCD patients (Control: 42.12±27.6; SSHU: 168.2±90.1 and SS: 231.4±123.7 p<0.0001). SS patients presented higher levels of MCP-1 in comparison to SSHU group (SSHU: 168.2±90.10 and SS: 231.4±123.7; p=0.023). The same results were observed for MDA (Control: 2:29±1:13; SSHU: 5.60±2.39 and SS: 7.23±2.64, p<0.0001) and NO (control: 2.25±1.9; SSHU: 56.54±9.1 and SS: 39.1±9.02, p<0.0001). A positive correlation was obtained between MCP-1 and MDA (r=0.34, p=0.01); albuminuria (r=0.5, p=0.03); NO (r=0.39, p=0.005).
Conclusion
The outcomes of the study suggest that MCP-1 is a predictive biomarker of renal lesion that can also reflect damage caused by oxidative stress present in SCD.

The HMG-box-containing proteins tHMG-1 and tHMG-2 interact during the histone-to-protamine transition in Drosophila spermatogenesis,

Abstract: Spermatogenesis is accompanied by a remarkable reorganization of the chromatin in post-meiotic stages, characterized by a near genome-wide displacement of histones by protamines and a transient expression of transition proteins. In Drosophila, the transition-protein-like protein Tpl94D contains an HMG-box domain and is expressed during chromatin reorganization. Here, we searched for additional HMG-box-containing proteins with a similar expression pattern. We identified two proteins specifically expressed in the testis, tHMG-1 and tHMG-2, whose expression levels were highest during the histone-to-protamine transition. Protein–protein interaction studies revealed that tHMG-1 and tHMG-2 form heterodimers in vivo. We demonstrated that Tpl94D, tHMG-1 and tHMG-2 localize to chromatin of the male germ line, with the most abundant levels observed during post-meiotic chromatin reorganization. Analysis of a tpl94D mutant showed that the C-terminal region of Tpl94D is dispensable for fertility. These data strongly suggested either that the truncated protein, which still contains the N-terminal HMG-box domain, is functional or that other proteins act in functional redundancy with Tpl94D during spermiogenesis. A thmg-1/thmg-2 null mutant also had no detectable specific phenotype, but hmgz, which encodes the major somatic HMG-box-containing protein HMGZ, was transcriptionally up-regulated. Our results showed that Drosophila spermatogenesis is characterized by continuous and overlapping expression of different HMG-box-containing proteins. We hypothesize that the mechanism of chromatin reorganization is a process highly secured by redundancies.

Abstract: Fetal hemoglobin-inducing therapies are disease-modifying and ameliorate the pain phenotype in sickle cell disease (SCD). Rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, increases HbF in erythroid precursor cells in vitro. We hypothesized that rapamycin would increase HbF levels and improve nociception phenotype in SCD mice. We used sine-wave electrical stimulation to examine nocifensive phenotype and evaluate myelinated [2000Hz (Aβ-fiber) and 250Hz (Aδ-fiber)] and unmyelinated (5Hz C-fibers)] sensory fiber function. Rapamycin significantly increased γ-globin mRNA and HbF levels [+2.3% (0.7, 3.9), mean increase (95% confidence interval, CI), p=0.006]. In homozygous (sickling) mice, long- (16 weeks), but not short-term (6 weeks), rapamycin treatment increased 2000Hz and 250Hz current thresholds in a pattern that varied according to sex. In male, but not female mice, rapamycin (compared with vehicle) was associated with increases in 2000Hz [21Units (7, 35), mean difference (95% CI), p=0.009 for sex∗treatment interaction] and 250Hz [9Units (1, 16), p=0.01] current thresholds. In rapamycin-treated homozygotes, HbF levels directly correlated with myelinated [2000Hz(Aβ-fiber, r=0.58, p=0.01) and 250Hz(Aδ-fiber, r=0.6, p=0.01)] but not unmyelinated sensory fiber current thresholds. These findings suggest that in SCD mice, rapamycin increases HbF and modulates current thresholds of myelinated fibers. Therefore, mTOR signaling might be implicated in the pathobiology of SCD.

Abstract: Regucalcin (RGN) is a calcium-binding protein, which has been shown to be underexpressed in cancer cases. This study aimed to determine the association of RGN expression with clinicopathological parameters of human breast cancer. In addition, the role of RGN in malignancy of mammary gland using transgenic rats overexpressing the protein (Tg-RGN) was investigated. Wild-type (Wt) and Tg-RGN rats were treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (DMBA). Carcinogen-induced tumors were histologically classified and the Ki67 proliferation index was estimated. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that RGN immunoreactivity was negatively correlated with the histological grade of breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma suggesting that progression of breast cancer is associated with loss of RGN. Tg-RGN rats displayed lower incidence of carcinogen-induced mammary gland tumors, as well as lower incidence of invasive forms. Moreover, higher proliferation was observed in non-invasive tumors of Wt animals comparatively with Tg-RGN. Overexpression of RGN was associated with diminished expression of cell-cycle inhibitors and increased expression of apoptosis inducers. Augmented activity of apoptosis effector caspase-3 was found in the mammary gland of Tg-RGN. RGN overexpression protected from carcinogen-induced mammary gland tumor development and was linked with reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. These findings indicated the protective role of RGN in the carcinogenesis of mammary gland.

Abstract: High levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can ameliorate human β-globin gene disorders. The short chain fatty acid butyrate is the paradigmatic metabolic intermediary that induces HbF. Inherited disorders of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism have been associated with supranormal HbF levels beyond infancy, e.g., propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA). We tested intermediaries of BCAA metabolism for their effects on definitive erythropoiesis. Like butyrate, the elevated BCAA intermediaries isovalerate, isobutyrate, and propionate, induce fetal globin gene expression in murine EryD in vitro, are associated with bulk histone H3 hyperacylation, and repress the transcription of key gamma globin regulatory factors, notably BCL11A and SOX6. Metabolic intermediaries that are elevated in Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) affect none of these processes. Percent HbF and gamma (γ) chain isoforms were also measured in non-anemic, therapeutically optimized subjects with MSUD (Group I, n=6) or with Isovaleric Acidemia (IVA), MMA, or PA (Group II, n=5). Mean HbF was 0.24±0.15% in Group I and 0.87±0.13% in Group II (p=.01); only the Gγ isoform was detected. We conclude that a family of biochemically related intermediaries of branched chain amino acid metabolism induces fetal hemoglobin during definitive erythropoiesis, with mechanisms that mirror those so far identified for butyrate.

Abstract: Morpholino and vivo-morpholino gene knockdown methods have been used to study thrombocyte function in zebrafish. However, a large-scale knockdown of the entire zebrafish genome using these technologies to study thrombocyte function is prohibitively expensive. We have developed an inexpensive gene knockdown method, which uses a hybrid of a control vivo-morpholino and a standard antisense oligonucleotide specific for a gene. This hybrid molecule is able to deliver antisense deoxyoligonucleotides into zebrafish thrombocytes because it piggybacks on a control vivo-morpholino. To validate use of this hybrid molecule in gene knockdowns, we targeted the thrombocyte specific αIIb gene with a hybrid of a control vivo-morpholino and an oligonucleotide antisense to αIIb mRNA. The use of this piggyback technology resulted in degradation of αIIb mRNA and led to thrombocyte functional defect. This piggyback method to knockdown genes is inexpensive since one control vivo-morpholino can be used to target many different genes by making many independent gene-specific oligonucleotide hybrids. Thus, this novel piggyback technology can be utilized for cost-effective large-scale knockdowns of genes to study thrombocyte function in zebrafish.

Abstract: Lysosomes are abundant organelles best known for their crucial role in macromolecule turnover. Lysosome dysfunction features in several diseases exemplified by the lysosomal storage disorders and is often associated with marked changes in lysosome structure. Lysosomal morphology may therefore serve as a sensitive readout of endocytic well-being. Here we describe methods for monitoring lysosome morphology in fixed and live cells using fluorescent probes and electron microscopy.

Abstract: In a wide range of organisms the kinetics of transcription have been found to be noisy, with “bursts” or “pulses” of transcription interspersed with irregular periods of inactivity. The in vivo analysis of transcription dynamics can be most directly monitored using RNA stem loop motifs derived from MS2 and other bacteriophages. Here we describe the implementation of the MS2 RNA detection system and the steps required for precise measurement of transcription dynamics in highly motile cells. Automated image processing techniques are used to track large numbers of cells and measure transcription in a systematic and unbiased manner. We discuss popular methods for automatic image segmentation and frame-to-frame tracking of cells, and the considerations required to make measurements as quantitatively as possible.

Abstract: In carrying out their role of free radical scavenging, erythrocytes become damaged due to oxidation of membrane lipids and proteins. Such damage may change the morphology of the erythrocytes. The present study aims to demonstrate change in erythrocyte morphology in MetS and associate the changes with increased oxidative stress and inflammation that were shown in our recent study. One hundred participants were recruited from a rural town of Australia. Whole blood viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation, erythrocyte deformability, lipid profile and blood sugar level, oxidative stress markers (erythrocyte reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, urinary isoprostanes) and inflammatory markers (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) were measured. Erythrocyte morphological study was performed by scanning electron microscopy. Recruited participants were classified into MetS and non-MetS following the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III definition. Data were analyzed by IBM SPSS 20 software. The mean percentages of biconcave cells were decreased whereas acanthocytes, stomatocytes and echinocytes were increased in MetS group compared to healthy controls. Morphologically abnormal erythrocytes were significantly correlated with oxidative stress and chronic inflammation markers. Free radicals generated in increased concentration in MetS seem to damage erythrocyte changing its morphology which possibly could affect other hemorheological parameters.

Abstract: Signal sensing in bacteria has traditionally been attributed to protein-based factors. It is however becoming increasingly clear that bacteria also exploit RNAs to serve this role. This review discusses how key developmental processes in bacteria, such as community formation, choice of a sessile versus motile lifestyle, or vegetative growth versus dormant spore formation may be governed by signal sensing RNAs. The signaling molecules that affect these processes, the RNAs that sense these molecules and the underlying molecular basis for specific signal-response are discussed here.

Abstract: Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are characterized by proteinaceous pulmonary edema and severe arterial hypoxemia with a mortality of approximately 40%. Stimulation of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) promotes Na+ transport, a rate-limiting step for pulmonary edema reabsorption. Insulin is known to participate in the ion transport; however, its role in pulmonary edema clearance and the regulatory mechanism involved have not been fully elucidated. In the current study, in a lipopolysaccharide-based mouse model of ALI, we found that insulin alleviated pulmonary edema by promoting ENaC-mediated alveolar fluid clearance through serum and glucocorticoid induced kinase-1 (SGK1). In alveolar epithelial cells, insulin increased the expression of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC, which was blocked by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) inhibitor or knockdown of Rictor (a necessary component of mTORC2), and SGK1 inhibitor, respectively. In addition, an immunoprecipitation study demonstrated that SGK1(Ser422) phosphorylation, the key step for complete SGK1 activation by insulin, was conducted through PI3K/mTORC2 pathway. Finally, we testified the role of mTORC2 in vivo by demonstrating that PP242 prevented insulin-stimulated SGK1 activation and ENaC increase during ALI. The data revealed that during ALI, insulin stimulates alveolar fluid clearance by upregulating the expression of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC at the cell surface, which was, at least, partially through activating mTROC2/SGK1 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Previously, we described the safety and therapeutic potential of neurospheres (NSs) derived from a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clone, 201B7, in a spinal cord injury (SCI) mouse model. However, several safety issues concerning iPSC-based cell therapy remain unresolved. Here, we investigated another iPSC clone, 253G1, that we established by transducing OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 into adult human dermal fibroblasts collected from the same donor who provided the 201B7 clone. The grafted 253G1-NSs survived, differentiated into three neural lineages, and promoted functional recovery accompanied by stimulated synapse formation 47 days after transplantation. However, long-term observation (for up to 103 days) revealed deteriorated motor function accompanied by tumor formation. The tumors consisted of Nestin+ undifferentiated neural cells and exhibited activation of the OCT4 transgene. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a heightened mesenchymal transition may have contributed to the progression of tumors derived from grafted cells.

Abstract: If we are to fully understand the reasons that cells and tissues move and acquire their distinctive geometries during processes such as embryogenesis and wound healing, we will need detailed maps of the forces involved. One of the best current prospects for obtaining this information is noninvasive force-from-images techniques such as CellFIT, the Cellular Force Inference Toolkit, whose various steps are discussed here. Like other current quasistatic approaches, this one assumes that cell shapes are produced by interactions between interfacial tensions and intracellular pressures. CellFIT, however, allows cells to have curvilinear boundaries, which can significantly improve inference accuracy and reduce noise sensitivity. The quality of a CellFIT analysis depends on how accurately the junction angles and edge curvatures are measured, and a software tool we describe facilitates determination and evaluation of this information. Special attention is required when edges are crenulated or significantly different in shape from a circular arc. Because the tension and pressure equations are overdetermined, a select number of edges can be removed from the analysis, and these might include edges that are poorly defined in the source image, too short to provide accurate angles or curvatures, or noncircular. The approach works well for aggregates with as many as 1000 cells, and introduced errors have significant effects on only a few adjacent cells. An understanding of these considerations will help CellFIT users to get the most out of this promising new technique.

Abstract: We previously showed that intraperitoneal administration of Freund's adjuvant treatment resulted in acute peritonitis and TGF-β was found to be one of the main organizers of the subsequent EMT in mesothelial cells. In the present study, we investigated whether TGF-β signaling molecules are present in mesothelial cells and how their compartmentalization pattern changes with the dynamics of inflammatory events in vivo. In addition, we tried to evaluate the turnover of endosomal compartments concomitant with the internalization of signaling molecules and examine whether caveola-mediated internalization might play a role in the termination of TGF-β signaling. Using immunocytochemical approach, we could detect TβRII in EEA1 positive compartments and as the inflammation progressed, at D3, the receptor appeared in caveolin-1 positive intracellular structures as well. The latter event was accompanied by the appearance of negative regulatory protein, Smad7 in caveolae. We also found EEA1 and caveolin-1 double positive vesicular structures that were corresponded to forming MVBs affirmed by our immuno-electron microscopical results. Fine structural, morphometric and immunoblot analysis proved that Cd63 positive multivesicular body (MVB) formation was significantly increased by D3 and the IP results confirmed that TβRII as well as caveolin-1 were strongly associated with these endosomal compartments at this time. In contrast, by the termination of inflammation, by D5, caveolin-1 was found to be associated with late endosomal marker, Rab7 and entirely degraded from the system. Despite the limitations of an in vivo system, our results provide both morphological and biochemical data about the endosomal compartments involved in the internalization of TβRII upon inflammatory stimuli. Furthermore, our study implies the possible role of caveola-mediated endocytosis in the attenuation of TGF-β signaling and highlight the significance of endosomal compartments via which caveolae might meet the classical endocytic pathway under in vivo inflammatory conditions.

Abstract: In modulated electrohyperthermia (mEHT) the enrichment of electric field and the concomitant heat can selectively induce cell death in malignant tumors as a result of elevated glycolysis, lactate production (Warburg effect), and reduced electric impedance in cancer compared to normal tissues. Earlier, we showed in HT29 colorectal cancer xenografts that the mEHT-provoked programmed cell death was dominantly caspase independent and driven by apoptosis inducing factor activation. Using this model here, we studied the mEHT-related cell stress 0-, 1-, 4-, 8-, 14-, 24-, 48-, 72-, 120-, 168- and 216-h post-treatment by focusing on damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signals. Significant cell death response upon mEHT treatment was accompanied by the early upregulation (4-h post-treatment) of heat shock protein (Hsp70 and Hsp90) mRNA levels. In situ, the treatment resulted in spatiotemporal occurrence of a DAMP protein signal sequence featured by the significant cytoplasmic to cell membrane translocation of calreticulin at 4 h, Hsp70 between 14 and 24 h and Hsp90 between 24- and 216-h post-treatment. The release of high-mobility group box1 protein (HMGB1) from tumor cell nuclei from 24-h post-treatment and its clearance from tumor cells by 48 h was also detected. Our results suggest that mEHT treatment can induce a DAMP-related signal sequence in colorectal cancer xenografts that may be relevant for promoting immunological cell death response, which need to be further tested in immune-competent animals.
