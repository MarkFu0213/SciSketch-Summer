Abstract: Summary
The understanding and control of the structural complexity of mesoporous semiconductors with single-crystal-like nature are both attractive and challenging. Here, we report a crystallization-driven epitaxial assembly from monomicelles to construct branched mesoporous TiO2 mesocrystals (m-TiO2 MCs) with coherent atomic domains. The star-shaped multipods are obtained by two-step evaporation with nanocrystal mediation, primarily consisting of arms along < 001 >, < 101 >, and < 111 > crystal directions. For each arm, ordered open mesochannels arrange in parallel along the growth direction. The m-TiO2 MC multipods have a surface area of ∼116 m2/g and single-crystal-like frameworks and are good hydrogen evolution photocatalysts. Under full-spectrum irradiation, the branched m-TiO2 MCs exhibit a hydrogen evolution rate of 8 mmol h−1 g−1, which is more than four times higher than that of commercial TiO2 P25. This crystallization-driven self-assembly approach may provide valuable insight into designing programmable mesoporous mesocrystals by controlling the oriented assembly of monomicelle building blocks.

Abstract: Summary
A key barrier to the use of carbon dioxide capture technologies is the operating energy requirement, the chief contributor being the energy required to regenerate the capture media. When paired with electricity generation, the parasitic energy load can prohibit implementation. While metal organic frameworks (MOFs) harbor significant adsorption capacities, their thermally insulating nature will require significant energy and time to regenerate. Here, we report a MOF nanocomposite that can be regenerated at high speed and low energy cost. An adsorption system is tailored to deliver a very low energy cost of only 1.29 MJ kg−1CO2, 45% below commercially deployed materials, which can be exploited to deliver a productivity as high as 3.13 kgCO2 h−1 kgAds−1. The combination of a MOF (Mg-MOF-74) with high adsorption capacity, a magnetic nanoparticle (MgFe2O4), and a porous hydrophobic polymer results in a composite that can be used in the magnetic induction swing adsorption (MISA) process.

Abstract: Excessive erythrocytosis (EE) is a characteristic of chronic mountain sickness (CMS). Currently, the pathogenesis of CMS remains unclear. This study was intended to investigate the role of EPAS1 in the proliferation of erythroblasts in CMS. Changes of HIF-1α and EPAS1/HIF-2α in the bone marrow erythroblasts of 21 patients with CMS and 14 control subjects residing at the same altitudes were determined by RT-qPCR and western blotting. We also developed a lentiviral vector, Lv-EPAS1/sh-EPAS1, to over-express/silence EPAS1 in K562 cells. Cells cycle and proliferation were detected by flow cytometry. Transcriptome analyses were carried out on Illumina. CMS patients showed a higher expression of EPAS1/HIF-2α in the bone marrow erythroblasts than those of controls. Variations in EPAS1 expression in CMS patients were positively correlated with RBC levels, and negatively correlated with SaO2. Over-expressing of EPAS1 in K562 cells accelerated the erythroid cells cycle progression and promoted the erythroid cells proliferation-and vice versa. Transcriptome data indicated that proliferation-related DEGs were significantly enriched in EPAS1 overexpression/silencing K562 cells. Our results suggest that EPAS1 might participate in the pathogenesis of EE by regulating the proliferation of erythroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Amyloid proteins and peptides are a major contributing factor to the development of various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s and prion diseases. Previously, a designed cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) comprising a hydrophobic signal sequence followed by a prion protein (PrP)-derived polycationic sequence (PrP23–28: KKRPKP) was shown to have potent anti-prion properties. Here, we extend this approach toward the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide amyloid formation, which is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. We characterized the interactions of the CPP with Aβ using complementary in vitro and in silico experiments. We report that the CPP stabilizes Aβ in a non-amyloid state and inhibits Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, replacing PrP23–28 with a corresponding segment from Aβ results in a construct with similar CPP functionality and antagonism of Aβ aggregation and neurotoxicity. Our findings reveal a general underlying principle for inhibition of pathogenic protein aggregation that may facilitate the design of CPP-based therapeutics for amyloid diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The size and shape control of amorphous nanomaterials has long been a bottleneck restricting their further development. Here, we present a general approach to synthesize more than twenty kinds of amorphous metal oxide nanosheets. The amorphous state of the nanosheets is determined using aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. By using extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, we demonstrate that amorphous nanosheets have a larger interatomic distance and a looser packing characteristic compared with crystalline counterparts. The as-prepared amorphous FeOx nanosheets are used as sodium-ion batteries anode materials, exhibiting notable performance with a specific capacity of 263.4 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and long-term cyclic stability. Significantly, a reversible amorphous-crystalline-amorphous structure transformation phenomenon during the cycling test is observed at the atomic scale.

Abstract: Summary
The characterization and detection of lithium metal plating during standard operation of commercial Li-ion batteries has been a long-term challenge; the nature of lithium metal plating is unpredictable and highly dependent on operating temperature and charge rate. In operando detection of lithium plating is critical for ongoing and future developments of conventional Li-ion batteries, including fast charging capabilities, extreme temperature applications, and lithium metal secondary batteries. In this study, we describe the use of acoustic ultrasound to detect lithium metal plating on commercial graphite anodes within a standard form factor. Extending from previous work on ultrasound as a battery diagnostic tool, this proof-of-concept study delineates statistically significant linear relationships between ultrasonic time-of-flight and graphite staging, and acoustic time-of-flight and post mortem electrochemical measurements to characterize the extent of lithium metal plating.

Abstract: Summary
In the presence of anisotropic biochemical or topographical patterns, cells tend to align in the direction of these cues—a widely reported phenomenon known as “contact guidance.” To investigate the origins of contact guidance, here, we created substrates micropatterned with parallel lines of fibronectin with dimensions spanning multiple orders of magnitude. Quantitative morphometric analysis of our experimental data reveals two regimes of contact guidance governed by the length scale of the cues that cannot be explained by enforced alignment of focal adhesions. Adopting computational simulations of cell remodeling on inhomogeneous substrates based on a statistical mechanics framework for living cells, we show that contact guidance emerges from anisotropic cell shape fluctuation and “gap avoidance,” i.e., the energetic penalty of cell adhesions on non-adhesive gaps. Our findings therefore point to general biophysical mechanisms underlying cellular contact guidance, without the necessity of invoking specific molecular pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon capture and storage, in which CO2 is selectively removed and sequestrated from flue gas, is a promising strategy to mitigate CO2 emissions and global warming. Conventionally, CO2 capture involves an energy-consuming absorbent regeneration step by thermal decomposition (2.0–4.0 GJ ton−1 CO2), which accounts for the majority (60%–70%) of the total cost. Here, we propose an alternative electrochemical cycle to capture CO2 in an aqueous alkaline solution, facilitated by the pH swing effect from a proton-coupled electron transfer redox reaction of a biological proton carrier, riboflavin 5′-monophosphate sodium salt hydrate (FMN/FMNH2). Under lab conditions, an electrolysis cell implementing the FMN proton carrier demonstrates a high energy efficiency, with only 9.8 kJ mol−1 CO2 captured, which is much lower than traditional approaches using a monoethanolamine absorbent (2.0–4.0 GJ ton−1 CO2, 88–176 kJ mol−1 CO2). Thus, this system may contribute toward lowering the cost of CO2 capture.

Abstract: Invadosomes are specialised actin-based dynamic microdomains of the plasma membrane. Their occurrence has been associated with cell adhesion, matrix degrading and mechanosensory functions that make them crucial regulators of cell migration and invasion. Monocytic, cancer cell and Src-transformed cell invadosomes have been extensively described. Less well defined are the structures which form in other cell types, i.e., non-haematopoietic and non-transformed cells, exposed to specific stimuli. We herein describe the specificities of podosomes induced in aortic endothelial cells stimulated with TGFβ in vitro and in conditions that more closely resemble the in vivo situation. These podosomes display the typical architecture of monocytic podosomes. They organise into large rosette-shape superstructures where they exhibit collective dynamic behavior consisting in cycles of formation and regression. At the ultrastructural level, microfilament arrangements in individual podosomes were revealed. Oxygen levels and hemodynamic forces, which are key players in endothelial cell biology, both influence the process. In 3D environment, podosomes appear as globular structures along cellular extensions. A better characterization of endothelial podosomes has far-reaching implications in the understanding and, possibly, in the treatment of some vascular diseases.

Abstract: GPC3 is a proteoglycan involved in the control of proliferation and survival, which has been linked to several tumor types. In this respect, we previously demonstrated that normal breast tissues exhibit high levels of GPC3, while its expression is diminished in tumors. However, the role of the GPC3 downregulation in breast cancer progression and its molecular and cellular operational machineries are not fully understood. In this study we showed that GPC3 reverts the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) underwent by mammary tumor cells, blocks metastatic spread and induces dormancy at secondary site. Using genetically modified murine breast cancer cell sublines, we demonstrated that the phospho-Erk/phospho-p38 ratio is lower in GPC3 reexpressing cells, while p21, p27 and SOX2 levels are higher, suggesting a dormant phenotype. In vivo metastasis assays confirmed that GPC3 reexpressing cells reduce their metastatic ability. Interestingly, the presence of dormant cells was evidenced in the lungs of inoculated mice. Dormant cells could reactivate their proliferative capacity, remain viable as well as tumorigenic, but they reentered in dormancy upon reaching secondary site. We also proved that GPC3 inhibits metastasis through p38 pathway activation. The in vivo inhibition of p38 induced an increase in cell invasion of GPC3 reexpressing orthotropic tumors as well as in spontaneous and experimental metastatic dissemination. In conclusion, our study shows that GPC3 returns mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells to an epithelial phenotype, impairs in vivo metastasis and induces tumor dormancy through p38 MAPK signaling activation. These results help to identify genetic determinants of dormancy and suggest the translational potential of research focusing in GPC3.

Abstract: Summary
Storing solar energy in chemical bonds is an effective strategy to overcome the intermittency of sunlight as an energy source. Here, we demonstrate unassisted light-driven electrochemical aqueous carbon dioxide reduction to carbon monoxide and methane using p-i-n double-cation lead halide perovskite solar cells in combination with catalytic electrodes for carbon dioxide reduction and water oxidation at near-neutral pH. Three series-connected photovoltaic cells and gold and ruthenium(IV) oxide electrodes provide carbon monoxide with >8% solar-to-carbon monoxide conversion efficiency for 4.5 h. Including concomitant hydrogen formation, the total solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency remains >8.3% for 10 h. Four series-connected cells with copper and ruthenium(IV) oxide electrodes provide methane. The longevity of the copper electrode improves by setting the cell to open circuit for 1 min every 15 min. The solar-to-methane conversion efficiency is close to 2%, and including 3% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency is 5% for 8 h.

Abstract: Patients with blood transfusion-dependent anemias develop transfusional iron overload (TIO), which may cause cardiosiderosis. In patients with an ineffective erythropoiesis, such as thalassemia major, common transfusion regimes aim at suppression of erythropoiesis and of enteral iron loading. Recent data suggest that maintaining residual, ineffective erythropoiesis may protect from cardiosiderosis. We investigated the common consequences of TIO, including cardiosiderosis, in a minipig model of iron overload with normal erythropoiesis. TIO was mimicked by long-term, weekly iron-dextran injections. Iron-dextran loading for around one year induced very high liver iron concentrations, but extrahepatic iron loading, and iron-induced toxicities were mild and did not include fibrosis. Iron deposits were primarily in reticuloendothelial cells, and parenchymal cardiac iron loading was mild. Compared to non-thalassemic patients with TIO, comparable cardiosiderosis in minipigs required about 4-fold greater body iron loads. It is suggested that this resistance against extrahepatic iron loading and toxicity in minipigs may at least in part be explained by a protective effect of the normal erythropoiesis, and additionally by a larger total iron storage capacity of RES than in patients with TIO. Parenteral iron-dextran loading of minipigs is a promising and feasible large-animal model of iron overload, that may mimic TIO in non-thalassemic patients.

Abstract: Summary
Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells formed using n-type Cz silicon wafers are attracting increasing industrial interest. Cheaper p-type Cz silicon wafers can also be used to form SHJ cells; however, they achieve lower efficiencies. In this work, a Monte Carlo simulation approach is used to provide a comprehensive commercial comparison between n-type and p-type wafers, considering a wide range of uncertainty in the cost of production, the cost of the wafers, and cell performance. The most critical factors influencing the commercial comparison between wafer types were identified as the difference in cell efficiency, the difference in cost between n-type and p-type wafers, and the SHJ processing costs. The analysis provides a target for p-type SHJ solar cells of being within 0.4% absolute of that obtained with n-type wafers. This work motivates and sets research targets for the development of SHJ solar cells fabricated on p-type wafers.

Abstract: The novel Coronavirus (CoVid-19) outbreak is now consider a world pandemic, affecting more than 1,300,000 people worldwide. Cancer patients are in risk for severe disease, including a higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for invasive ventilation or death. Management of patients with lymphoid malignancies can be challenging during the outbreak, due to need of multiple hospital visits and admissions, immunosuppression and need for chemotherapy, radiotherapy and stem cell transplantation. In this article, we will focus on the practical management of patients with lymphoid malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on minimizing the risk for patients.

Abstract: Summary
The internet of things revolution requires efficient, easy-to-integrate energy harvesting. Here, we report indoor power generation by flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) manufactured on roll-to-roll indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated ultra-thin flexible glass (FG) substrates with notable transmittance (>80%), sheet resistance (13 Ω/square), and bendability, surpassing 1,600 bending procedures at 20.5-mm curvature. Optimized PSCs on FG incorporate a mesoporous scaffold over SnO2 compact layers delivering efficiencies of 20.6% (16.7 μW⋅cm−2 power density) and 22.6% (35.0 μW⋅cm−2) under 200 and 400 lx LED illumination, respectively. These represent, to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported for any indoor flexible solar cell technology, surpassing by a 60%–90% margin the prior best-performing flexible PSCs. Specific powers (W/g) delivered by these lightweight cells are 40%–55% higher than their counterparts on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films and an order of magnitude greater than those on rigid glass, highlighting the potential of flexible FG-PSCs as a key enabling technology for powering indoor electronics of the future.

Abstract: Summary
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) is a green and cost-effective technique for valuable small active molecule reclamation from organic solvent systems. To date, it remains challenging to develop highly permeable and precisely sieving nanoporous membranes capable of working with dual solvent systems. Herein, we design polar-group-enriched conjugated nanoporous membranes (CNMs) to achieve ultrahigh performance for dual solvents. The CNMs contain sodium polymethacrylate-grafted-UiO-66 metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles, which can create additional interfacial nano-pores for solvent permeation, enhance solvent affinity, and partially reduce the swelling of the CNMs. Consequently, our membranes exhibit ultrahigh permeances in dual solvents (EtOH 53.9 L m–2 h–1 bar–1, H2O 58.1 L m–2 h–1 bar–1, pentane 244.0 L m–2 h–1 bar–1 and hexane 172.9 L m–2 h–1 bar–1) with molecular weight cut-off below 400 Da, which is superior to many state-of-the-art OSN membranes, demonstrating potential for diverse applications from pharmaceutical industry to chemical engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Nanodiamonds (NDs) with nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers have the potential for quantum information science and bioimaging due to their stable and non-classical photon emission at room temperature. Large-scale fabrication of molecular-size nanodiamonds with sufficient color centers may economically promote their application in versatile multidisciplinary fields. Here, the manufacture of molecular-size NV center-enriched nanodiamonds from graphite powder is reported. We use an ultrafast laser shocking technique to generate intense plasma, which transforms graphite to nanodiamonds under the confinement layer. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the high pressure of 35 GPa and the high temperature of 3,000K result in the metaphase transition of graphite to nanodiamonds within 100 ps. A high concentration of NV centers is observed at the optimal laser energy of 3.82 GW/cm2, at which point molecular-size (∼5 nm) nanodiamonds can individually host as many as 100 NV centers. Consecutive melamine annealing following ultrafast laser shocking enriches the number of NV centers >10-fold and enhances the spontaneous decay rate of the NV center by up to 5 times. Our work may enhance the feasibility of nanodiamonds for applications, including quantum information, electromagnetic sensing, bioimaging, and drug delivery.

Abstract: Kinesin-7 CENP-E motor protein is essential for chromosome alignment and kinetochore-microtubule attachment in cell division. Human CENP-E has recently identified to be linked with the microcephalic primordial dwarfism syndromes associated with a smaller head, brain malformations and a prominent nose. However, the roles of CENP-E in embryonic development remain largely unknown. In this study, we find that zebrafish CENP-E inhibition results in defects in early zygote cleavage, including asymmetric cell division, cell cycle arrest and the developmental abnormalities. We also demonstrate that CENP-E ablation in cultured cells leads to chromosome misalignment, spindle abnormalities and interruptions of the cell cycle. These observations suggest that CENP-E plays a key role in early cell division and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, we also find that CENP-E inhibition results in the defects in the epiboly, the developmental arrest, the smaller head and the abnormal embryo during zebrafish embryogenesis. Our data demonstrate new functions of CENP-E in development and provide insights into its essential roles in organogenesis.

Abstract: Background
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) microenvironment plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in CLL-B cell migration and survival. CD147 is associated with MMPs production by tumor and stromal cells.
Aim
To analyze CD147, MMP2 and MMP9 expression in CLL-B cells and its modulation by fibroblasts (Fb)-CLL-B cell interaction.
Methods
CLL-B cells were co-cultured with Fb, as a simulation of CLL microenvironment. CD147 was evaluated in healthy donor (HD)-B cells and CLL-B cells by flow cytometry. MMP2 and MMP9 activity in CLL-plasma samples and conditioned media (CMs) was studied by zymography.
Results
MMP9/MMP2 plasma levels were significantly higher in CLL patients than in HD. CD147 expression (median fluorescence intensity) in CLL patients characterized 3 groups: low- (19.1 ± 3.2; n=3), middle- (42.7 ± 12.8; n=18) and high- (76.5 ± 9.6; n=5) related to CD147 expression in HD-B cells. CD147 expression significantly increased in CLL-B cells after Fb-CLL-B cell co-culture. A significant increase in proMMP2 activity was observed in CMs obtained from Fb-CLL-B cell co-cultures in comparison with isolated CLL-B cells.
Conclusions
CD147 expression in CLL-B cells and MMPs secretion was induced by Fb-CLL-B cell contact, suggesting CD147 participation in the CLL pathophysiology.

Abstract: The mitochondrial network structure dynamically adapts to cellular metabolic challenges. Mitochondrial depolarisation, particularly, induces fragmentation of the network. This fragmentation may be a result of either a direct regulation of the mitochondrial fusion machinery by transmembrane potential or an indirect effect of metabolic remodelling. Activities of ATP synthase and adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) link the mitochondrial transmembrane potential with the cytosolic NTP/NDP ratio. Given that mitochondrial fusion requires cytosolic GTP, a decrease in the NTP/NDP ratio might also account for protonophore-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. For evaluating the contributions of direct and indirect mechanisms to mitochondrial remodelling, we assessed the morphology of the mitochondrial network in yeast cells with inhibited ANT. We showed that the repression of AAC2 (PET9), a major ANT gene in yeast, increases mitochondrial transmembrane potential. However, the mitochondrial network in this strain was fragmented. Meanwhile, AAC2 repression did not prevent mitochondrial fusion in zygotes; nor did it inhibit mitochondrial hyperfusion induced by Dnm1p inhibitor mdivi-1. These results suggest that the inhibition of ANT, rather than preventing mitochondrial fusion, facilitates mitochondrial fission. The protonophores were not able to induce additional mitochondrial fragmentation in an AAC2-repressed strain and in yeast cells with inhibited ATP synthase. Importantly, treatment with the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin A also induced mitochondrial fragmentation and hyperpolarization. Taken together, our data suggest that ATP/ADP translocation plays a crucial role in shaping of the mitochondrial network and exemplify that an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential does not necessarily oppose mitochondrial fragmentation.

Abstract: Subnormal IgG1 or IgG3 levels occurred in 30% of hemochromatosis probands with HFE p.C282Y homozygosity and were concordant in HLA-identical siblings. We sought to identify factors associated with IgG subclasses in Alabama probands with p.C282Y homozygosity evaluated for 500 kb microhaplotypes AAT and GGG defined by SNPs in chromosome 6p genes PGBD1, ZNF193, and ZNF165. In regressions on IgG subclasses, we used: age; sex; GGG (dichotomous); iron removed to achieve depletion; CD8+ T-lymphocytes; and other IgG subclasses. Among 49 probands, AAT and GGG occurred in 95.9% and 16.3%, respectively. Thirteen probands (26.5%) had subnormal IgG1; 11 probands (22.4%) had subnormal IgG3. Mean IgG3 was higher in probands with than without GGG (75 mg/dL [95% confidence interval 63, 89] vs. 58 mg/dL [49, 71], respectively; p = 0.0321). Regression on IgG3 revealed: GGG positivity (p = 0.0106); and IgG1 (p = 0.0015). In a replication cohort of 22 Portugal probands with p.C282Y homozygosity, mean IgG3 was higher in probands with than without GGG (46 ± 16 vs. 31 ± 12 mg/dL, respectively; p = 0.0410). We conclude that mean IgG3 levels are higher in hemochromatosis probands with p.C282Y homozygosity with chromosome 6p microhaplotype GGG than in probands homozygous for microhaplotype AAT.

Abstract: Differently of two-dimensional cell culture, three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroid model allows cells to establish cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions over the entire cell surface, more closely mimicking tumor microenvironments and cellular subpopulations with specific standards of morphology, differentiation and gene expression. Thenceforth several methodologies involving or the 3D cell aggregates generation or its histological processing and analysis have emerged, but in general they are laborious, expensive and complex to set up as a routine technique. Thus, we developed a complete methodology, detailing a simple, accessible and low-cost step by step, including 1) the 3D cell aggregate generation using hanging drop technique; 2) providing a simple way to assess morphological parameters of generated spheroids; followed by 3) a multiple and organized histological processing, keeping several individual spheroids inside an agarose apparatus, maintaining a known order and position of each ones, similar to tissue microarray principle; 4) until the last step, where it is allowed a simultaneous histological composition analysis of several spheroid slices, organized side by side, in a same block section, through conventional stainings or 5) immunostaining against different molecular markers. Therefore, the present methodology aims to popularize 3D cell culture, allowing to make this a regular technique in basic cell biology research, once all steps are performed without using onerous reagents, materials or equipment. In addition to bring the agarose apparatus as a simple low cost novelty, allowing high-throughput analysis of several spheroids simultaneously in an organized manner.

Abstract: Summary
Optically active α-quaternary amino acids have received much attention because of the important biomedical applications implicated for compounds containing this structure. Additionally, asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized chiral α-quaternary amino esters with vicinal stereocenters by a single catalyst is still a great challenge due to the difficulty in stereocontrol of the configurations. Here, we develop a copper-catalyzed highly diastereo- and enantioselective three-component coupling of allenes, diboron, and ketiminoesters to access chiral quaternary amino esters with adjacent stereocenters. The stereochemical control is enabled by using bulky C2-symmetric N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as a chiral ligand. This protocol also features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, and may subsequently have diverse applications in organic synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
The productivity of continuously cycled atmospheric water harvesting methods using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been limited by a lack of scalable designs and robust MOF form factors compatible with rapid heat and mass transport. Explored here is the fluidization of MOF-801 powder in its native particulate form as a water vapor sorption unit. Fluidization results in a very high sorbent-air interface area and small distances over which mass diffusion must occur. This arrangement enables adsorption and desorption cycling with periods of 26 and 36 min at, respectively, 18% and 39% relative humidity (RH) with ∼80% of MOF-801 uptake capacity. This results in dynamic steady-state operation water vapor harvesting rates of 0.33 L/h/kgMOF at 18% RH (40 cycles per day at 22°C) and 0.52 L/h/kgMOF at 39% RH (55 cycles per day at 23.5°C). The measurements may have direct application to water harvesting systems.

Abstract: Summary
The synthesis of discrete nanoparticle self-assemblies has challenged the nanotechnology field for decades and has limited the study of nanoparticle interactions and the advance of nanomachinery. Here, we describe the preparation of discrete nanoparticle dimers from spherical gold nanoparticles and gold nanorods with stimuli-responsive optical properties as a result of site-specific DNA functionalization with an active triple helix motif. We present discrete assemblies using anisotropic nanoparticles that dynamically respond to changes in pH. Our approach to creating building blocks for nanoparticle self-assembly capable of creating discrete structures may allow for the future study of nanoparticle-nanoparticle interactions, plasmonic sensors, and nanoparticle-DNA hybrid nanomachinery.

Abstract: Summary
Energy harvesters are required for autonomous sensors. The field is still missing a low-cost technology that would provide enough power for tangible low-frequency use cases, although triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) have emerged as a new energy technology. Standard vibration energy harvesters (VEHs) are based either on bulky electromagnetic systems or stiff lead-based piezo-ceramics. Those systems are rarely compatible with large deformations that occur at low frequency such as body movements. Here, we show that a stack of 10 thin layers of poly(vinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene) screen printed on a polymer substrate can harvest up to 0.97 mW at 33 Hz with an area of only 2.4 cm2. These results are obtained with a lead-free, cost-effective, and scalable technique at 150°C, competing with TENG solutions. This VEH can work for at least 107 cycles while harvesting sufficient energy to feed a microcontroller that communicate wirelessly with a mobile phone.

Abstract: Summary
Room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries possess higher specific energy and improved inherent safety compared to their high-temperature analogs used in stationary grid storage. The viability of room temperature sodium batteries depends critically on the mechanical and ionic transport properties of the solid electrolyte interphase. However, little emphasis has been placed on developing sodium anode interphases that combine high Young’s modulus (stiffness), high critical strain (ductility), and low ionic diffusion barrier for cycling at high rates. Here, we report an artificial biphasic interphase comprising two chemically distinct phases, NaOH and NaNH2, which combines high stiffness and high ductility. In addition, the biphasic interphase exhibits a low diffusion barrier for sodium ions, enabling reversible sodium plating and stripping behavior even at extremely high current densities (up to 50 mA cm−2) in symmetric cell configuration. Stable and reversible cycling of a room temperature sodium-sulfur battery is also demonstrated over 500 cycles.

Abstract: Summary
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a very stable material with tunable electronic properties dependent on its reduction level. Nevertheless, the incorporation of rGO into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) frequently demonstrates inconsistent results, and it plays an ambiguous role. Here, we systematically explore rGO as an additive in perovskite and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) using different reduction levels (O18.42%, O9.67%, and O7.14%). Perovskite with rGOO9.67% results in the most stable shelf stability, demonstrating a negligible performance degradation over 430 h, while the one without rGO shows a 6.4% drop, mainly due to fill-factor deterioration. Moreover, the improved stability is more pronounced when rGOO9.67% is employed with spiro-MeOTAD where crystallization is effectively retarded. The integrated effect is also observed in PSCs based on rGOO9.67% in both perovskite and spiro-MeOTAD, leading to enhanced stability at 85°C and 45% relative humidity.

Abstract: Summary
The realization of robust luminescence in crystalline and anisotropic nanowires of wide bandgap light-emitting conjugated polymers (LCPs) is challenging. Compared to the periodic arrangements in conventional crystalline nanostructure, hierarchical uniform structures will provide an electronic landscape to obtain excellent optoelectronic behaviors, which are desirable for polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) and polymer lasers. Here, we construct a range of robust hierarchical uniform crystalline nanowires of wide bandgap polydiarylfluorenes for light-emitting optoelectronic applications. Steric hindrance interactions of the bulky groups enable these nanowires to show a robust deep-blue emission, due to the suppression of interchain aggregation. Therefore, efficient deep-blue nanowire-based PLEDs with an intrachain excitonic behavior are fabricated. Moreover, our β-conformational hierarchical uniform nanowires present a low-threshold deep-blue lasing behavior. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep-blue organic nanolaser based on LCPs self-assembled nanowires by constructing hierarchical uniform crystalline structure.

Abstract: Summary
Electrocatalytic palladium membrane reactors (ePMRs) use electricity to hydrogenate organic molecules at ambient temperature and pressure. These benign reaction conditions position ePMRs as a sustainable alternative to thermochemical hydrogenation, which requires high-temperature and high-pressure reaction conditions. However, ePMRs suffer from slow reaction rates and a limited understanding of the factors that govern reaction performance in these devices. In this work, we report the design and validation of an ePMR flow cell. This flow cell increases reaction rates 15-fold and current efficiencies by 30% relative to H-cell reactors. We use this device to reveal that the hydrogen content in the palladium membrane governs the speed and selectivity of hydrogenation reactions, while the amount of hydrogen gas evolved at the palladium surface is deterministic of current efficiency. We contend that this flow cell, which enables hydrogenation without hydrogen gas, is an important step for translating ePMRs into practice.

Abstract: Summary
Despite intense efforts during the past decades, most of the existing photocatalysts suffer from low solar energy conversion efficiency. Herein, we examine the photocatalytic mechanism of water splitting on Pt/TiO2 catalysts using in situ solid-state NMR and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The experimental results demonstrate that the formation of H2 and O2− and the subsequent oxidization of surface molecules by O2− all occur on the co-catalyst Pt. It is inevitable that in the absence of sacrifice reagent, the O2− would consume neighboring H2 to regenerate H2O in the traditional method. Accordingly, we propose a new strategy for the photolysis of pure water by controlling water loading on the surface of TiO2, which can hinder H2 to interact with O2− to regenerate H2O. The efficiency of the strategy can reach ∼560 μmol H2/g/h, and the overall solar energy conversion efficiency is determined to be ∼0.46%, while those of the traditional method are negligible.

Abstract: Podosomes are mechanosensitive attachment/invasion structures that form on the matrix-adhesion interface of cells and protrude into the extracellular matrix to probe and remodel. Despite their central role in many cellular processes, their exact molecular structure and function remain only partially understood. We review recent progress in molecular scale imaging of podosome architecture, including our newly developed localisation microscopy technique termed HAWK which enables artefact-free live-cell super-resolution microscopy of podosome ring proteins, and report new results on combining fluorescence localisation microscopy (STORM/PALM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) on one setup, where localisation microscopy provides the location and dynamics of fluorescently labelled podosome components, while the spatial variation of stiffness is mapped with AFM. For two-colour localisation microscopy we combine iFluor-647, which has previously been shown to eliminate the need to change buffer between imaging modes, with the photoswitchable protein mEOS3.2, which also enables live cell imaging.

Abstract: Introduction
Febrile neutropenia is a common cause in morbidity and mortality during treatment of hematological neoplasms.
Methods
Subjects included all cases admitted under hematology department with febrile neutropenia from February to June 2018. Each febrile episode was investigated by standard investigations (Blood culture, Chest x ray etc.); Procalcitonin (PCT) and c reactive protein (CRP) was sent at fever onset 0, 24, 48 h, day 7 and day 14.
Results
Data was analyzed for 52 febrile episodes in 50 patients. PCT cut off value at 24 h of ≤1.2 ng/ml had a sensitivity and specificity of 62.5% and 87.5% for discriminating Invasive fungal infection (IFI) and Microbiologically documented infection (MDI) (p = 0.033). PCT had a negative predictive value of 70% for the diagnosis of IFI as compared to MDI. CRP cut off >160 mg/dl at 48 h was suggestive of fever due to fungal infection with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 48%, PPV of 33.3% and NPV of 100%. CRP at 24 and 48 h of fever was useful to distinguish non-infectious causes of fever from infectious causes.
Conclusion
PCT at 24 h and CRP at 48 h was useful in identifying fungal infection. CRP was a better marker when compared to PCT for identifying disease fever.

Abstract: Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with hyperglycemia and loss of functional beta cell mass. Inducing proliferation of preexisting beta cells is an approach to increase the numbers of beta cells. In this study, we examined a panel of selected small molecules for their proliferation-inducing effects on human pancreatic beta cells. Our results demonstrated that a small molecule inhibitor of the menin-MLL interaction (MI-2) and small molecule inhibitors of TGF-β signaling (SB431542, LY2157299, or LY364947) synergistically increased ex vivo replication of human beta cells. We showed that this increased proliferation did not affect insulin production, as a pivotal indication of beta cell function. We further provided evidence which suggested that menin-MLL and TGF-β inhibition cooperated through downregulation of cell cycle inhibitors CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN2C. Our findings might provide a new option for extending the pharmacological repertoire for induction of beta cell proliferation as a potential therapeutic approach for diabetes.

Abstract: Glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) p.D519G (rs11558492) was identified as a genetic modifier correlated with more severe iron overload in hemochromatosis through whole-exome sequencing of HFE p.C282Y homozygotes with extreme iron phenotypes. We studied the prevalence of p.D519G in HFE p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes, a genotype associated with iron overload in some patients. Cases were Australian participants with elevated serum ferritin (SF) levels ≥300μg/L (males) and ≥200μg/L (females); subjects whose SF levels were below these cut-offs were designated as controls. Samples were genotyped for GNPAT p.D519G. We compared the allele frequency of the present subjects, with/without elevated SF, to p.D519G frequency in public datasets. GNPAT p.D519G was more prevalent in our cohort of p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes with elevated SF (37%) than European public datasets: 1000G 21%, gnomAD 20% and ESP 21%. We conclude that GNPAT p.D519G is associated with elevated SF in Australian HFE p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes.

Abstract: Eupalinilide E was assessed for ex-vivo expansion activity on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from human cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells in serum-free, SCF, TPO and FL stimulated 7 day cultures. Eupalinilide E ex-vivo enhanced phenotyped (p) HSCs and glycolysis of CD34+ cells isolated 7 days after culture as measured by extracellular acidification rate, but did not alone show enhanced NSG engrafting capability of HSCs as determined by chimerism and numbers of SCID Repopulating cells, a quantitative measure of functional human HSCs. This is another example of pHSCs not necessarily recapitulating functional activity of these cells. Lack of effect on engrafting HSCs may be due to a number of possibilities, including down regulation of CXCR4 or of the homing capacity of these treated cells. However, Eupalinilide did act in an additive to synergistic fashion with UM171 to enhance ex vivo expansion of both pHSCs, and functionally engrafting HSCs. While reasons for the disconnect between pHSC and function of HSCs with Eupalinilide E alone cultured CB CD34+ cells is yet to be determined, the data suggest possible future use of Eupalinilide and UM171 together to enhance ex vivo production of CB HSCs for clinical hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to multi-carbon chemicals over Cu-derived catalysts is currently restricted by the low faradaic efficiency (FE) and production rate of C2+ products. Here, we report tandem gas diffusion electrodes yielding C2+ products at simultaneously high FE and production rate via sequential CO2 reduction on two independent, selective, and adjacent catalyst layers. The tandem electrodes possess the intrinsic benefits of lower onset potential and higher partial current densities of C2+ products compared to bare copper electrodes. Through balancing the CO generation and consumption rates, the FEs of both C2+ products and C2H4 for tandem electrodes can be maximized to exceed those for bare copper electrodes. The optimized Cu/Ni-N-C tandem electrode, which comprises sequential Cu and Ni-N-C catalyst layers, reaches FE of 62% and partial current density of 415 mA cm−2 for C2H4 at −0.70 V versus RHE.

Abstract: Summary
Harvesting energy from low-temperature heat sources (<100°C) would enable the exploitation of currently untapped renewable sources. Recently proposed techniques fail to reach suitable efficiencies. We propose here a redox flow battery that can be recharged by a thermal process, distillation. The electrochemical cell produces electrical energy from the mixing free energy of two sodium iodide aqueous solutions at different concentrations. The electrochemical cell is based on the technology of sodium ion-conducting ceramics and is coupled with a liquid-liquid extraction process, performed by an unconventional device, the “through-liquid-exchanger.” Our technique bypasses the bottleneck of other similar techniques by working with solutions at very high concentrations. Our initial experiments prove an unprecedented energy efficiency (ratio between the electrical work produced and the incoming heat necessary to restore the initial solutions concentrations) of 3% from a heat source <100°C and a power density of 10 W/m2, with the possibility of further improvements.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroelectric domain wall (DW) conduction, confirmed in recent experiments, has attracted intense attention due to its promising applications in optoelectronic devices. Herein, we provide theoretical evidence of electric conduction in Pb0.8Ca0.2TiO3 (PCT) DWs. The separation of charge accumulation in DWs, corresponding to the electronic conduction-band minimum (CBM) and valence-band maximum (VBM), weakens the tendency for the electron-hole recombination, thereby providing more efficient channels for charge transfer. We fabricate PCT-based functional photovoltaic devices with polarization tunable charge transfer to exploit the combined conduction and ferroelectric properties of the DW. The photovoltaic performance of the devices can be regulated by the alternation of ferroelectric domains in PCT, caused by variation of the external poling. Our work broadens the applicability of DW conduction and may inspire the future design of high-performance materials in photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: ANKHD1 is highly expressed in various cancers such as leukemia and multiple myeloma. Silencing of ANKHD1 expression leads to decreased cell proliferation and accumulation of cells at the S phase. In this study we found ANKHD1 expression to be higher at the S phase, suggesting it to be an S phase protein. We observed that ANKHD1 interacts with histone promoter regions and its inhibition downregulates expression of all core histones, implying a role in histone synthesis. Since histone synthesis occurs in parallel with DNA replication at S phase, we evaluated PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) expression, a protein involved in DNA replication and repair. PCNA expression was found to be significantly decreased in ANKHD1 silenced cells. We further observed accumulation γH2AX, a marker for DNA double stranded breaks and an early sign of DNA damage induced by replication stress, upon ANKHD1 silencing. The expressions of several genes implicated in DNA repair were also modulated in ANKHD1 silenced cells, confirming the role of ANKHD1 in DNA repair. Based on this study we speculate that ANKHD1 is an S phase protein required for histone synthesis and DNA repair. These results however, are preliminary and require thorough investigation.

Abstract: Summary
The transfer of molecular machine technology into aggregated states is a key step for the realization of many potential applications. Here we report three organic luminescent agents, CzS-o-py, CzS-m-py, and CzS-p-py, that can adjust organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) via orderly stimulus-responsive molecular motion in the crystal. Careful analysis of the single-crystal structure before and after ordered molecular motion, coupled with theoretical calculations, reveals the effective intermolecular charge transfer generated by the dense packing mode to be responsible for the RTP effect. Accordingly, a dual anti-counterfeiting application is successfully implemented, exploiting the RTP effect of the stimulus response. The introduction of molecular mechanical technology may provide a strategy for the molecular design, internal mechanism exploration, and practical application of RTP luminescent agents.

Abstract: Summary
Great focus has recently been placed on anionic redox, to which high capacities of Li-rich layered oxides are attributed. With almost doubled capacity compared with state-of-the-art cathode materials, Li-rich layered oxides still fall short in other performance metrics. Among these, voltage decay upon cycling remains the most hindering obstacle, in which defect electrochemistry plays a critical role. Here, we reveal that the metastable state of cycled Li-rich layered oxide, which stems from structural defects in different dimensions, is responsible for the voltage decay. More importantly, through mild thermal energy, the metastable state can be driven to a stable state, bringing about structural and voltage recovery. However, for the classic layered oxide without reversible anionic redox, thermal energy can only introduce cation disordering, leading to performance deterioration. These insights elucidate that understanding the structure metastability and reversibility is essential for implementing design strategies to improve cycling stability for high-capacity layered oxides.

Abstract: Summary
Monofunctional carbonyls are readily available from fossil fuels and biomass on earth. They are cornerstones of organic chemistry but are rarely used as monomers for polymer materials. Here, we demonstrate a versatile single-atom polymerization (SAP) method using monofunctional carbonyls as building blocks, where bifunctionalization of monofunctional carbonyls is critical. Through SAP, a series of alcohol-containing polymers, which are difficult to synthesize by other traditional polymerization methodologies, are prepared. These polymers exhibit structure-specific luminescence, and polytriphenylethanol represents a rare type of aggregation-induced emission luminogen without traditional chromophores. This can be used for supersensitive explosive detection at the picogram level. SAP also results in polymerization-induced emission behavior from nonemissive monomers. Due to the cornerstone significance and extreme availability of carbonyls and unique polymer functionalities, this may allow us to exploit earth’s carbonyl resources more efficiently.

Abstract: Summary
Side-by-side installations of flat plate photovoltaics and parabolic trough collectors consume significant space and have high system losses; by using an all-in-one, spectrum-splitting hybrid receiver, electricity and high-temperature heat can be generated with a single efficient system. Here, the performance of a transmissive concentrator photovoltaic/thermal (tCPV/T) system is demonstrated on-sun, with a total energy efficiency of 85.1% ± 3.3%, 138 W electric power at 304 suns (with average cell temperatures <110°C), 903 W hot water output (average 34°C and 1.7 bar, peak temperatures to 56°C), and 1,139 W high-temperature steam output (average 201°C and 45 bar, peak temperatures up to 248°C). The spectrum-splitting hybrid receiver uses a sparse array of III–V triple-junction solar cells on GaAs substrates contained within a transparent microchannel water cooling stack, followed by a structured flow path thermal receiver cooled with pressurized water. System economics based on a 2.72-m2 prototype performance is shown to be at or near market competitiveness to natural-gas-produced process heat for a variety of locations, with a levelized cost of heat of 0.03 $/kWth for an installation in San Diego, California.

Abstract: Summary
Stimuli-responsive elastic organogels have a potential for functional sensors and actuators. However, it remains a challenge to prepare an organogel actuator that can be driven by in situ swelling to generate controlled shape morphing and maintain its kinematic activities with consecutive sorption/desorption of organic solvents. Here, we report a stretchable (strain, 130%), robust (stress, 7.0 MPa), and elastic organogel that is synthesized through ring-opening polymerization of a long-chain epoxide monomer into a crosslinking fluoro-network (CFN). The structure results in the organogel being capable of absorbing polar organic solvents (maximum swellability: 178% ± 10%) and generating indefatigable shape morphing. The in situ swelling (no diffusion) of organic droplets can induce shape morphing in a controllable manner, without the assistance of any structural designs, such as surface patterning, bilayer structures, and origamis. A series of kinematics tests demonstrate that the CFN organogel has a potential for chemical sensing devices.

Abstract: A comprehensive genotype-phenotype analysis of pediatric T-ALL data was performed. 33 confirmed pediatric (≤12 y) T-ALL samples were evaluated for oncogenic transcripts: TLX-1, TLX-3, common fusion of STIL-TAL1, NOTCH1 mutations and copy number variations (CNVs). Mean WBC was 235.69 × 103/μL. TLX1 and TLX-3 overexpression detected in 1 (3%) and 7 (21%) patients and STIL-TAL1 in 8 (27%). NOTCH1 mutations were noted in 17 (52%), of which 12 (71%) in HD domain and 6 (35%) in PEST domain (including one case with mutations in all three domains). Commonest CNVs were CDKN2A (85%) and CDKN2B (75%). Relapse occurred in 8 (24%) patients. The median follow-up was 15 months (range: 0.5–36). Bulky liver (p = 0.025), day 35 marrow (p = 0.004) and NOTCH mutation (p = 0.046) were predictive of time to an event. RFS was significantly poor for cases with PEST Vs. HD domain mutations (50% Vs. 85%) (p = 0.0009). Though cases with PEST domain NOTCH mutations had poor RFS, the OS was not influenced by NOTCH mutation positivity.

Abstract: Venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) is multi-factorial disease involving several genetic and acquired risk factors responsible for its onset. It may occur spontaneously upon climbing at High Altitude (HA). Several studies demonstrated that hypoxic conditions prevailing at HA pose an independent risk factor for VTE; however, molecular mechanism remains unknown. Present study aims to identify genes associated with HA-induced VTE pathophysiology using real time TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) of known candidate genes. Gene expression of total 93 genes were studied and analyzed in patients of VTE from HA (HA-VTE) and from sea level (SL-VTE) in comparison to respective controls. Both HA-VTE and SL-VTE patients showed up-regulation of 37 genes involved in blood coagulation cascade, clot formation, platelet formation, endothelial response, angiogenesis, cell adhesion and calcium channel activity. Seven genes including ACE, EREG, C8A, DLG2, USF1, F2 and PCDHA7 were up-regulated in both HA-controls and VTE patients (both HA-VTE and SL-VTE) indicating their role during VTE event and also upon HA exposure. Ten genes; CDH18, FGA, EDNBR, GATA2, MAPK9, BCAR1, FRK, F11, PCDHA1 and ST8SIA4 were uniquely up-regulated in HA-VTE. The differentially expressed genes from the present study could be determining factors for HA-VTE susceptibility and provide insights into VTE occurrence at HA.

Abstract: Summary
As a non-destructive and label-free detection technology, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been widely used in environmental-pollutant detection, biological-tissue sensing, molecular fingerprint analysis, and so on. Herein, we report an active SERS material, namely quasi-metallic WO2 nanodendrites. Due to the dual boosts of electromagnetic mechanism (EM) enhancement and chemical mechanism (CM) enhancement, the WO2 nanodendrites achieve an 8.5 × 107 level enhanced factor and a 10−10 level detection limit for probe molecules. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the performance comes from the dual enhancement of the highly efficient interface charge transfer and the vigorous surface plasma resonance (SPR) of the quasi-metals. Furthermore, these WO2 nanodendrites show high chemical stability, are resistant to long-term air oxidation, and even can endure strong acid and alkali corrosion without reducing their SERS activity. The separation and detection of multicomponent samples are achieved simultaneously when these nanodendrites are fabricated into patterned SERS chips.

Abstract: Summary
To date, MXene dispersions have been mostly limited to polar solvents. Here, we show that when the lithium cations present between MXene multilayers after etching are exchanged with di(hydrogenated tallow)benzyl methyl ammonium chloride (DHT), they become organophilic and form highly stable colloidal suspensions in nonpolar solvents. The rapid cation exchange occurs under ambient conditions and the resulting two-dimensional flakes are well dispersed and remain oxide free. A 142 ± 0.7-μm thick film (≈10 mg ⋅ cm−2) made from a DHT-Ti3C2Tz suspension in toluene exhibits pseudocapacitive behavior, with a capacitance of 305 F ⋅ g−1 at a scan rate 2 mV ⋅ s−1. The moduli and tensile strengths of solution-processed polyethylene nanocomposites are increased by ≈11% and 32% with a loading of ≈1 vol% DHT-Ti3C2Tz. Our approach may enable the use of MXenes in multiple research and industrial fields.

Abstract: Summary
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the emerging solar cell technologies with high conversion efficiency. Several deposition methods had been applied for preparing their hole transport layer (HTL). However, there are few direct evidences to demonstrate whether HTL and its interfaces in PSCs have been influenced by the deposition methods. In this study, the 3D morphology of PSCs has been reconstructed by focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy from the PSCs in which HTLs are deposited by different methods. The compositional distribution of HTLs is unveiled as well. All these associated layers and interfaces display obvious morphological and compositional differences that are attributed to the HTL components’ solubility differences in the precursor solvent. Our investigation demonstrates the PSCs that HTL fabricated by dynamic spin-coating method have higher efficiency, better film uniformity, and less interfacial roughness than the static spin-coating-based devices.

Abstract: Summary
Solar thermal conversion (STC) evaporation is a practical and sustainable technology for seawater desalination and sewage abatement. However, both the limited evaporation efficiency and long-term conversion stability restrain its practical application. Herein, a lotus morphology-inspired biomimetic evaporator (MBE) with Janus wettability and bimodal pores is well designed for high-rate and enduring STC evaporation. Just like lotus leaves, the hydrophobic surface of the MBE cuts off the capillarity of water, hence achieving high-efficient salt resistance and solar absorption, while the hydrophilic substance provides fast water transportation. The bimodal-pore structures formed by incorporating lotus root-like mesopores into the 3D truss-like macropores effectively decrease density and thermal conductivity for self-floating and thermal regulation. This results in a low water vaporization enthalpy of 1846 J g−1, leading to a much higher evaporation rate at the same conversion efficiency. This work may open new avenues for developing high-performance evaporation systems.

Abstract: Deregulation of TGF-β signaling is intricately engrossed in the pathophysiology of pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PDACs). The role of TGF-β all through pancreatic cancer initiation and progression is multifarious and somewhat paradoxical. TGF-β plays a tumor suppressive role in early-stage pancreatic cancer by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting epithelial cell cycle progression, but incites tumor promotion in late-stage by modulating genomic instability, neo-angiogenesis, immune evasion, cell motility, and metastasis. Here, we provide evidences that Par-4 acts as one of the vital mediators to regulate TGF-β/Smad4 pathway, wherein, Par-4 induction/over-expression induced EMT which was later culminated in to apoptosis in presence of TGF-β via positive regulation of Smad4. Intriguingly, Par-4−/− cells were devoid of significant Smad4 induction compared to Par-4+/+ cells in presence of TGF-β and ectopic Par-4 steadily augmented Smad4 expression by restoring TGF-β/Smad4 axis in Panc-1 cells. Further, our FACS and western blotting results unveiled that Par-4 dragged the PDAC cells to G1 arrest in presence of TGF-β byelevating p21 and p27 levels while attenuating Cyclin E and A levels and augmenting caspase 3 cleavage triggering lethal EMT. Through restoration of Smad4, we further establish that in BxPC3 cell line (Smad4-/-), Smad4 is essential for Par-4 to indulge TGF-β dependent lethal EMT program. The mechanistic relevance of Par-4 mediated Smad4 activation was additionally validated by co-immunoprecipitation wherein disruption of NM23H1-STRAP interaction by Par-4 rescues TGF-β/Smad4 pathway in PDAC and mediates the tumor suppressive role of TGF-β, therefore serving as a vital cog to restore the apoptotic functions of TGF-β pathway.

Abstract: KLF1 (EKLF) is a master regulator of erythropoiesis and controls expression of a wide array of target genes. We interrogated human tissue microarray samples via immunohistological analysis to address whether levels of KLF1 protein are associated with leukemia. We have made the unexpected findings that higher KLF1 levels are correlated with cells containing abnormal chromosomes, and that high KLF1 expression is not limited to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with erythroid/megakaryoblastic differentiation. Expression of KLF1 is associated with poor survival. Further analyses reveal that KLF1 directly regulates a number of genes that play a role in chromosomal integrity. Together these results suggest that monitoring KLF1 levels may provide a new marker for risk stratification and prognosis in patients with AML.

Abstract: β-Hemoglobinopathies are among the most common single-gene disorders and are caused by different mutations in the β-globin gene. Recent curative therapeutic approaches for these disorders utilize lentiviral vectors (LVs) to introduce a functional copy of the β-globin gene into the patient's hematopoietic stem cells. Alternatively, fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can reduce or even prevent the symptoms of disease when expressed in adults. Thus, induction of HbF by means of LVs and other molecular approaches has become an alternative treatment of β-hemoglobinopathies. Here, we performed a head-to-head comparative analysis of HbF-inducing LVs encoding for: 1) IGF2BP1, 2) miRNA-embedded shRNA (shmiR) sequences specific for the γ-globin repressor protein BCL11A, and 3) γ-globin gene. Furthermore, two novel baboon envelope proteins (BaEV)-LVs were compared to the commonly used vesicular-stomatitis-virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-LVs. Therapeutic levels of HbF were achieved for all VSV-G-LV approaches, from a therapeutic level of 20% using γ-globin LVs to 50% for both IGF2BP1 and BCL11A-shmiR LVs. Contrarily, BaEV-LVs conferred lower HbF expression with a peak level of 13%, however, this could still ameliorate symptoms of disease. From this thorough comparative analysis of independent HbF-inducing LV strategies, we conclude that HbF-inducing VSV-G-LVs represent a promising alternative to β-globin gene addition for patients with β-hemoglobinopathies.

Abstract: Background
Cell-mediated immunity including T-cells (T helper and cytotoxic) plays an essential role in efficient antiviral responses against coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the ratio and expression of CD4 and CD8 markers in COVID-19 patients to clarify the immune characterizations of CD4 and CD8 T-cells in COVID-19 patients.
Methods
Peripheral blood samples of 25 COVID-19 patients and 25 normal individuals with similar age and sex as the control group were collected. White blood cells, platelets, and lymphocytes were counted and CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry.
Results
The number of white blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelets were reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients (P < 0.05). The difference in CD4:CD8 ratio, CD4 T-cell frequency, CD8 T-cell frequency, and CD4 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was not significant between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals (P > 0.05); however, the CD8 MFI increased significantly in COVID-19 infected patients (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
Although, there is no significant difference in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 between two groups, the expression level of CD8 in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than the normal individuals. This result suggested that the cellular immune responses triggered by COVID-19 infection were developed through overexpression of CD8 and hyperactivation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

Abstract: Summary
The 3d transition metals have been investigated as active centers in NiOOH to catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER); however, questions about the mechanism remain. Here, we study how cobalt (Co) and iron (Fe) doping and CoFe codoping determine the OER activity of NiOOH via experiments and theoretical calculations. The results show that both Co and Fe, with enhanced density of states near the Fermi level, decrease the overpotential by increasing the binding energy of O∗ and consequently exhibit higher activities than nickel. In particular, Fe, with nearly optimal O∗ binding energy, exhibits the lowest overpotential of 181 mV to reach 50 mA cm−2. In the case of CoFe codoping, Co alters the electronic states of Fe, which weakens the Fe-OOH bond and slightly increases the overpotential. Based on the calculated activities, an overpotential contour plot is constructed, providing guidance for catalyst design via modulating electronic structures and intermediate binding energies.

Abstract: Summary
Singlet oxygen (SO) is one of the reactive oxygen species that is effective in various uses, including performing chemical reactions, treating water impurities, and aiding in medicinal therapy. The generation of SO is often efficient in solution, although generation from the solid phase in nanomaterials is less reliable. Here, we report the preparation of hybrid supramolecular materials that incorporate a photosensitizer within their nanostructured fibers and demonstrate their high efficiency in promoting SO formation. The incorporation of tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin within the nanofibers of a bis-imidazolium gelator was proved by various techniques, including super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF) microscopy, which shows the location of the chromophore precisely. SO is generated from the dispersed nanofibers far more efficiently than the dissolved porphyrin; a 14-fold higher rate is observed initially. These results point to an effective approach to the generation of SO for several applications, from optimizing synthetic protocols to photomedicine.

Abstract: Congenital erythrocytosis (CE) can be classified as primary and secondary and 82 consecutive patients of erythrocytosis who were JAK-2 mutation negative, were further investigated. The genomic DNA was extracted from all the patients and the EPO-R, VHL, EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes were PCR amplified and sequenced. The sequence analysis showed (28/82) 34.14% patients had mutations. Among them, (19/28) 67.86% patients had mutations in exon 8 of EPO-R gene, of which six were novel missense mutations, p.(Gly418Ala), p.(Gly390Ala), p.(Ala411Thr), p.(Gly475Val), p.(Glu490Asp), p.(Glu362Gln) and three were novel frameshift mutations, p.(Glu336*), p.(Pro327Hisfs*68), p.(Gly479Alafs*37). All these EPO-R patients were heterozygotes and were forming endogenous erythrocyte colonies (EEC). Some patients (8/28) 28.57% had mutations in VHL gene, out of which 3 novel homozygous missense mutations in exon 1 of VHL gene, p.Gly80Asp, p.Gln107Glu and p.Gln113Glu, were identified. In addition, (1/28) 3.5% patients had one reported heterozygous missense mutation in exon 12 of EPAS1 gene p.Gly537Arg and one novel frameshift mutation p.(Ala553Glyfs*58). Further, in silico analysis indicated most of the mutations, probably, were damaging the protein structures, causing the CE in these patients. In this study the mutations in EPO-R and EPAS1 genes were identified for the first time in India.

Abstract: Summary
Many methods exist for the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), but precise morphology control allowing the tailoring of core-shell and yolk-shell nanostructures has been elusive, mainly due to poor control of the reaction-diffusion processes. Herein, we propose the precise regulation of the COF generation and decomposition rates and their relationship with the diffusion rate of COF species during the synthesis, which enables a successful preparation of core-shell, yolk-shell, hollow-spherical, and multiple yolk-shell COF structures with tunable sizes ranging from 200 to 1,400 nm. Formed COF structures can serve as nanoreactors or nanocontainers, with the shell layer providing molecular-size selectivity determined by the nanopore size demonstrated here using Suzuki coupling reactions with phenylboronic acid, which produce a size-cutoff efficiency for halogenated aromatics approaching 100%. The precise morphology design and control of COF particles and hybrids may help enhance application efficiencies and provide access to new functionalities for COF materials.

Abstract: Summary
Direct liquid fuel cells with high energy density and facile fuel storage have received increasing attention. Owing to the poor reactivity of conventional liquid fuels, they not only require noble metal catalysts for their oxidation but also exhibit limited performance. Here, we report a power-generation system, the direct liquid e-fuel cell, where “e-fuel” stands for “electrically rechargeable fuel.” This e-fuel cell consists of a catalyst-free graphite-felt anode and a conventional oxygen cathode separated by a proton exchange membrane, producing a maximum current density of 750 mA cm−2, a peak power density of 293 mW cm−2, and an energy efficiency of 42.3% at room temperature, which is much higher than the performances achieved by conventional direct liquid fuel cells. This emerging technology, capable of fast recharging, could be a powerful, efficient, cost-effective, and durable power-generation device, showing great potential for commercialization in the fuel cell electric vehicle industry.

Abstract: Since the World has been facing the COVID-19 pandemic, special attention has been taken concerning cancer patients; related to their immunosuppression status, adding risk for more aggressive COVID-19 and mortality, but also concerns about the access and the quality of care in cancer therapy. The COVID-19 pandemic impacts the number of infected, its related mortality, as well as the care of cancer patients. Multiple myeloma patients are a particular group with several important aspects to be considered during pandemic times. In essence, they are immunosuppressed in different intensities during their treatment. Most of them are elderly and all of them require long-term therapy, with prolonged contact with the health care system, possibly including a stem cell transplant during the treatment. A panel of experts in multiple myeloma and infectious diseases discusses pieces of evidence and the lack of the same in the scenario of COVID-19 in myeloma patients, while also exposing what is expected for the next phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract: Background/objective
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disease with multiple phenotypic expressions. Previous studies describing SCD clinical phenotypes in Nigeria were localized, with limited data, hence the need to understand how SCD varies across Nigeria.
Method
The Sickle Pan African Research Consortium (SPARCO) with a hub in Tanzania and collaborative sites in Tanzania, Ghana and Nigeria, is establishing a single patient-consented electronic database with a target of 13,000 SCD patients. In collaboration with the Sickle Cell Support Society of Nigeria, 20 hospitals, with paediatric and adult SCD clinics, are participating in patient recruitment. Demographic and clinical information, collected with uniform case report forms, were entered into Excel spreadsheets and uploaded into Research Electronic Data Capture software by trained data clerks and frequency tables generated.
Result
Data were available on 3622 patients enrolled in the database, comprising 1889 (52.9%) females and 1434 (39.6%) children ≤15 years. The frequencies of Hb SS, Hb SC and Hb Sβ thalassemia in this data set were 97.5%, 2.5% and 0% respectively. Sixty percent, 23.8%, 5.9%, 4.8% and 2.5% have had bone pain crisis, dactylitis, acute chest syndrome, priapism and stroke respectively. The most frequent chronic complications were: leg ulcers (6.5%), avascular necrosis of bone (6.0%), renal (6.3%) and pulmonary hypertension (1.1%). Only 13.2% had been hospitalized while 67.5% had received blood transfusion.
Conclusion
These data on the spectrum of clinical phenotypes of SCD are useful for planning, improving the management of SCD across Nigeria and provide a foundation for genomic research on SCD.

Abstract: Summary
Transition metal-catalyzed C–C bond functionalization has recently been identified as an increasingly versatile tool for organic syntheses, as otherwise unreactive functionalities can be used as efficient handles for synthetic manipulations. This work describes site-selective manganese(I)-catalyzed C–C hydroarylations of heteroarenes with substituted allenes. The C–C activations are efficiently catalyzed by MnBn(CO)5 and afford 1,2,3-tri-substituted arenes with notable diastereoselectivity. Moreover, the ring-expansion reaction proceeds via a C–C allylation/Michael addition cascade, providing challenging 8-membered carbocycles, thus highlighting the unique characteristics of the MnBn(CO)5 complex. Mechanistic studies reveal that the organometallic C–C activation occurs faster than typical C–H activations, thus providing a complementary approach to well-established methodologies for late-stage diversification.

Abstract: Summary
Visible-light communication (VLC) based on white light-emitting diodes has recently attracted much attention to provide high-bitrate data communication in indoor environments. One of the remaining challenges to be resolved to enable the proliferation of VLC systems is related to channel attenuation and multiple path fading. Here, we introduce an advanced VLC system integrating an optical amplifier as a promising solution to overcome channel impairments, providing high bitrate coverage. The optical amplifier is a flexible fiber based on a poly(fluorene)-based lumophore doped within a di-ureasil organic-inorganic hybrid. Optical amplification is demonstrated for pre-amplifier and relay node scenarios, yielding a maximum gain of 5.9 ± 0.2 dB and 3.7 ± 0.2 dB, respectively, establishing the proposed approach as a promising cost-effective solution for VLCs. Additionally, numerical simulations show, for a realistic environment, a 207% improvement in the coverage area, using existing lighting infrastructure without extra cost.

Abstract: Summary
Nitrogen-doped (N-doped) carbon materials have been widely studied for electrocatalytic CO2R to CO. However, the active sites in N-doped carbon remain under debate owing to the complication in N types and the challenge in controllable synthesis. Here, via an innovative approach of template-assisted pyrolysis of phthalocyanine, we achieve a controlled preparation of N types in N-doped carbon foams. Electrochemical experiments show that the catalyst dominated by graphitic N rather than other N types drives highly selective CO2R to CO against the hydrogen evolution reaction, which achieves a CO Faradaic efficiency of 95% at −0.5 V versus RHE and runs stably for 80 h. Theoretical calculations indicate that carbon atoms next to graphitic N are triggered for the CO production, while carbon atoms next to pyridinic N promote the hydrogen evolution and pyrrolic N disfavors both reactions.

Abstract: Summary
Ultra-high-molecular-weight (UHMW) polymers can display outstanding properties; however, it is challenging to synthesize UHMW polymers by using external free radical initiators. To address this, here, we report the ration design and adoption of B-alkylcatecholborane (RBCat) as a radical initiator in controlled radical polymerization in the presence of a chain-transfer agent. The autoxidation of RBCat with one alkyl substituent generates only one alkyl radical. The oxygen is incorporated and stored in the oxidized form (ROOB-Cat) that slowly releases the alkyl radical. The rationally designed alkyl radical is proposed to preferentially activate the chain-transfer agent (CTA) and grow the polymer chain from CTA, so limited free polymer chains are formed from the initiating alkyl radicals. Polymerizations of (meth)acrylates are achieved with narrow molecular weight distribution (Ð = 1.10) and predetermined molecular weights even in a UHMW range (up to 3 million). The successful chain extension of UHMW indicates the high degree of control of the polymerization.

Abstract: Summary
Single-atom catalysts with unique electronic structures are drawing increasing attention as compared with nano-catalysts. However, subnano-catalysts, falling between the two categories, may match the demands of catalytic reactions better due to their tunable electronic structure, but they have rarely been studied. Here, we report a subnano-ruthenium species anchored on nano-SnO2 (Ru@SnO2). Although rutile SnO2 and RuO2 are isostructural and tend to form a spinodal structure in bulk materials, the Ru@SnO2 nano-structure is successfully prepared by our newly developed micro-etching technique. The optimized sample displays high activity for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction with low overpotential and flat Tafel slope, superior to commercial Pt/C (20 wt%), while density functional theory investigations on the hydrogen-binding energy and Gibbs free energy are consistent with these results. The inherent design and synthesis strategies reported herein may open a new avenue for further catalyst development.

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that erythrocytes actively modulate blood clotting and thrombus formation. The lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is produced by activated platelets, and triggers a signaling process in erythrocytes. This results in cellular calcium uptake and exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) at the cell surface, thereby generating activated membrane binding sites for factors of the clotting cascade. Moreover, erythrocytes of patients with a bleeding disorder and mutations in the scramblase TMEM16F show impaired PS exposure and microvesiculation upon treatment with calcium ionophore. We report that TMEM16F inhibitors tannic acid (TA) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibit LPA-induced PS exposure and calcium uptake at low micromolar concentrations; fluoxetine, an antidepressant and a known activator of TMEM16F, enhances these processes. These effectors likewise modulate erythrocyte PS exposure and microvesicle shedding induced by calcium ionophore treatment. Further, LPA-treated erythrocytes triggered thrombin generation in platelet-free plasma which was partially impaired in the presence of TA and EGCG. Thus, this study suggests that LPA activates the scramblase TMEM16F in erythrocytes, thereby possibly mediating a pro-thrombotic function in these cells. EGCG as well as fluoxetine, substances with potentially high plasma concentrations due to alimentation or medical treatment, should be considered as potential effectors of systemic hemostatic regulation.

Abstract: Background
Five main genes are associated with hemochromatosis; however, current studies show that, in addition to these genes, others may be associated with primary iron overload (IO). One of these is the bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6), which encodes a protein that modulates hepcidin synthesis and, consequently, iron homeostasis.
Aim
To identify BMP6 gene pathogenic variants in patients with IO and non-homozygous genotype for the HFE p.Cys282Tyr mutation.
Materials and methods
Fifty-three patients with primary IO and non-homozygous genotype for the HFE p.Cys282Tyr were selected. Subsequent bidirectional DNA sequencing of BMP6 exons was performed.
Results
Two novel variants were found. One at homozygous state p.Gln158Ter (c.472C>T) was pathogenic, the other one at heterozygous state p.Val394Met (c.1180G>A) was of uncertain significance (VUS); the third variant at heterozygous state p.Arg257His (c.770G>A) has already been described and associated with IO. No BMP6 pathogenic variants that would explain iron overload phenotypes were detected in 94% of the studied patients.
Conclusion
Identification of the BMP6 pathogenic variants in Brazilian patients with primary IO might contribute to the genetic understanding of this phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
The development of solid-state batteries has encountered a number of problems due to the complex interfacial contact conditions between lithium (Li) metal and solid electrolytes (SEs). Recent experiments have shown that applying stack pressure can ameliorate these problems. Here, we report a multi-scale three-dimensional time-dependent contact model for describing the Li-SE interface evolution under stack pressure. Our simulation considers the surface roughness of the Li and SEs, Li elastoplasticity, Li creep, and the Li metal plating/stripping process. Consistency between the very recent experiments from two different research groups indicates effective yield strength of the Li used in those experiments of 16 ± 2 MPa. We suggest that the preferred stack pressure be at least 20 MPa to maintain a relatively small interface resistance while reducing void volume.

Abstract: Podosomes are prominent actin-based adhesion structures in a variety of cell types. They feature an extensive repertoire of functions, which requires exquisite spatiotemporal fine-tuning. Accordingly, podosomes consist of hundreds of different components, which fulfill specific structural and regulatory functions. Moreover, it has become apparent that podosome architecture is more intricate than previously believed. The classical model of an actin-rich core surrounded by a ring structure containing adhesion plaque proteins thus had to be expanded, and several additional substructures have been described, most notably the podosome cap on top of the actin-rich core. Here, we discuss the known components of the podosome cap, the history of their detection and their potential regulatory roles in podosome turnover and function. We also point out strategies for identifying further cap components and present a new model for the podosome cap as a multilayered module that fine-tunes actomyosin contractility, a central requirement for podosome architecture, dynamics and function.

Abstract: Objective
miR-194-5p and NEAT1 have been reported to be associated with multiple malignancies, but their roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains not fully understood.
Methods
Bone marrow samples were collected for monocyte separation. qRT-PCR assay was performed to investigate the expression patterns of NEAT1 and miR-194-5p in AML. CCK-8, soft agar colony formation, flow cytometry and transwell assays were employed to explore the biological functions of NEAT1 or miR-194-5p. Methylation PCR was performed to monitor the methylation of NEAT1. Luciferase reporter assay was subjected to verify the relationship between miR-194-5p and DNMT3A. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were performed to detect the alterations of protein expression.
Results
NEAT1 and miR-194-5p were both down-regulated in AML. Overexpression of either NEAT1 or miR-194-5p repressed proliferation, induced apoptosis and restrained migration and invasion of AML cells. There was a negative correlation between NEAT1 and DNMT3A in AML. Knockdown of DNMT3A dramatically decreased the methylation of NEAT1. Moreover, DNMT3A was identified as a downstream target of miR-194-5p. Furthermore, down-regulation of DNMT3A rescued the impacts on the malignant phenotypes of NEAT1 inhibition by miR-194-5p inhibitor.
Conclusion
Altogether, down-regulation of NEAT1 mediated by miR-194-5p/DNMT3A axis promotes AML progression, which might provide therapeutic targets in AML treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The development of high-power fuel cells could advance the electrification of the transportation sector, including marine and air transport. Liquid-fueled fuel cells are particularly attractive for such applications as they obviate the issue of fuel transportation and storage. Here, we report a direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC) for high-power propulsion applications that delivers ∼0.9 W cm−2 peak power by using a pH gradient-enabled microscale bipolar interface (PMBI) to effectively meet the incongruent pH requirements for borohydride oxidation/peroxide reduction reactions. Reactant-transport engineering of the anode flow field architecture and fuel flowrates mitigates parasitic borohydride hydrolysis and hydrogen oxidation reactions and lessens anode passivation by hydrogen bubbles. We identify an optimal flow regime range, broadly applicable to other liquid-fed fuel cells, in terms of the standard dimensionless Reynolds number (Re) and the Damkohler number (Da). DBFCs fulfilling these criteria provide a 2.4 times higher power density at 1.5 V compared to state-of-the-art polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) that typically operate at 0.75 V. The high peak power density of 890 mW cm−2 at 1.1 V may offer a pathway to reduce fuel cell stack size for propulsion applications.

Abstract: Summary
Silicon-based multi-junction (tandem) technology is one potential route to the next breakthrough for terrestrial photovoltaic conversion. Significant progress has been made in tandem solar cells. To move forward, development of tandem module technology is essential. Here, we theoretically compare five possible tandem module architectures with multiple material combinations by modeling their outdoor performance ratios around the globe. This framework aids in evaluating future module designs and technology pathways by relating lab-based efficiency to field performance and even project financing. We find that tandem performance ratios depend notably on climate conditions. In general, three-terminal and mechanically voltage-matched modules show exceptionally good outdoor performance. Furthermore, we investigate the implications of technical performance on manufacturing cost globally and find that tandems are promising in high-value markets in arid climates, where a three to five times increase in the current silicon module manufacturing cost is allowed under an optimistic scenario.

Abstract: Summary
Creating crystalline porous materials with large pores is typically challenging due to undesired interpenetration, staggered stacking, or weakened framework stability. Here, we report a pore size expansion strategy by “shape-matching” intermolecular π-π stacking interactions in a series of two-dimensional (2D) hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), HOF-10x (x = 0,1,2), self-assembled from pyrene-based tectons with systematic elongation of π-conjugated molecular arms. This strategy successfully avoids interpenetration or staggered stacking and expands the pore size of HOF materials to access mesoporous HOF-102, which features a surface area of ∼2,500 m2/g and the largest pore volume (1.3 cm3/g) to date among all reported HOFs. More importantly, HOF-102 shows significantly enhanced thermal and chemical stability as evidenced by powder X-ray diffraction and N2 isotherms after treatments in challenging conditions. Such stability enables the easy fabrication of a HOF-102/fiber composite for the efficient photochemical detoxification of a mustard gas simulant.

Abstract: Summary
Translating the potential of transition metal catalysis to biological and living environments promises to have a profound impact in chemical biology and biomedicine. A major challenge in the field is the creation of metal-based catalysts that remain active over time. Here, we demonstrate that embedding a reactive metallic core within a microporous metal-organic framework-based cloak preserves the catalytic site from passivation and deactivation, while allowing a suitable diffusion of the reactants. Specifically, we report the fabrication of nanoreactors composed of a palladium nanocube core and a nanometric imidazolate framework, which behave as robust, long-lasting nanoreactors capable of removing propargylic groups from phenol-derived pro-fluorophores in biological milieu and inside living cells. These heterogeneous catalysts can be reused within the same cells, promoting the chemical transformation of recurrent batches of reactants. We also report the assembly of tissue-like 3D spheroids containing the nanoreactors and demonstrate that they can perform the reactions in a repeated manner.

Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of disorders whose common characteristic is the presence of hemoglobin (Hb) S in erythrocytes. The main consequence of this abnormality is vaso-occlusion, which can affect almost all organs including the placenta. This study aimed to evaluate the gene expression profile in placentas of women with SCD by means of total RNA sequencing. For this, we proposed a case-control study, with three groups of pregnant women: HbSS (n = 10), HbSC (n = 14) and HbAA (n = 21). The results showed differences in expression in a number of genes such as NOS2 (fold change, FC = 4.52), HLAG (FC = 5.56), ASCL2 (FC = 3.61), CXCL10 (FC = −3.66) and IL1R2 (FC = 3.92) for the HbSC group and S100A8 (FC = -3.82), CPXM2 (FC = 4.57), CXCL10 (FC = −4.59), CXCL11 (FC = −3.72) and CAMP (FC = −4.55) for the HbSS group. Differentially expressed genes are mainly associated with migration, trophoblast differentiation and inflammation. The causes leading to altered gene expression in placentas of sickle cell patients are not fully understood, but the presence of intravascular hemolysis and vaso-occlusion, with cycles of ischemia and reperfusion, may contribute to the emergence of an environment which can be very harmful for placental physiology, altering the nutrient supply and metabolic exchange for fetal growth.

Abstract: Summary
Exoskeletons of Odontodactylus japonicas, the “smasher-type” mantis shrimp, feature a raptorial appendage comprising a Bouligand architecture of chitin nanofibrils with newly observed voids or defects between the polysaccharide α-chitin and protein interfaces. Here, we use a continuous-fiber 3D printing technology to simulate such materials in carbon fiber-reinforced (helicoidal) composites, complete with the presence of voids due to imperfect printing. The specific impact energies of the 3D printed helicoidal composites are clearly superior and further enhanced by the presence of the voids. To explain the role of the Bouligand architecture, interlaminar stresses are computed and found to yield anti-delamination characteristics, and a theoretical model is derived to evaluate the optimal helicoidal architecture. Finite element modeling indicates that the voids tend to deform and coalesce on loading and appear to guide the fracture into the formation of an ideally twisted crack in the printed helicoidal composites, thereby contributing to the impact toughness.

Abstract: Summary
Li2MnO3 endows Li-rich layered oxides with a superior energy density; however, its electron transfer mechanism is still unclear. Here, the electronic and thermodynamic behavior of LixMnO3 (x = 0.5–2) is determined using first-principles computations. The cationic redox, anionic redox, and local electron exchange in Mn-O polyhedron are revealed. An obvious electron donation inclination of manganese is demonstrated when the Li+ content is low. Through ab initio molecular dynamics, high valence Mn6+ and Mn7+ are generated in the form of MnO4 tetrahedrons with structural transformation toward a disordered structure, controlled by the Li+ content and dynamic energy barrier. Furthermore, a local redox reaction between Mn6+ or Mn7+ and their surrounding oxygen atoms is elucidated. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding regarding the electron transfer in LixMnO3 is provided. Our results bring insight regarding the electron transfer mechanism in Li-rich layered oxide cathode materials and encourage further reconsideration and investigation into its redox mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Mixed-matrix membranes have great potential for post-combustion carbon capture. To make membrane-based carbon capture economically viable, new formulations with high selectivity and CO2 permeance must be identified. We demonstrate here the ability to break the permeability-selectivity trade-off by using multicomponent mixed-matrix membranes (McMMMs) with two, three, or four components. Each of these components has a specific function and is designed for compatibility and high separation performance. A highly permeable polymer of intrinsic microporosity, PIM-1, and a CO2-selective polyphosphazene polymer, MEEP80, are chosen as polymer matrices. Chemical interaction between MOF nanoparticles and polymers is a key factor for optimizing the MOF-polymer interfacial compatibility. The systematic study of the impact of MOF pore size and the binding site is investigated to produce 10 different composite membranes. The permeability-selectivity values surpass the Robeson upper bound, while the predicted cost of carbon capture is reduced, which suggests the potential of these membranes for practical CO2 separations.

Abstract: Sterile Inflammation (SI), a condition where damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from dying cells, leads to TLR (Toll-like receptor) activation and triggers hypoxemia in circulation leading to venous thrombosis (VT) through tissue factor (TF) activation, but its importance under acute hypoxia (AH) remains unexplored. Thus, we hypothesized that eRNA released from dying cells under AH activates TF via the TLR3-ERK1/2-AP1 pathway, leading to VT. Animals were exposed to stimulate hypoxia for 0–24 h at standard temperature and humidity. RNaseA and DNase1 were injected immediately before exposure. TLR3 gene silencing was performed through in vivo injection of TLR3 siRNA. 80 μg/kg BW of isolated eRNA and eDNA were injected 6 h prior to sacrifice. Antigens of TF pathway were determined by ELISA and TF activity by a chromogenic assay. AH exposure significantly induced release of SI markers i.e. eRNA, eDNA, HMGB1 and upregulated TLR3, ERK1/2 (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases), AP1 (Activator Protein-1) and TF, whereas RNaseA pre-treatment diminished the effect of AH, thus inhibiting TF expression as well as activity during AH. Hence, we propose a possible mechanism of AH-induced TF activation and thrombosis where RNaseA can become the novel focal point in ameliorating therapy for AH induced thrombosis.

Abstract: We investigated biomarkers and genetic modulators of the cerebral vasculopathy (CV) subphenotype in pediatric sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients of sub-Saharan African ancestry. We found that one VCAM1 promoter haplotype (haplotype 7) and VCAM1 single nucleotide variant rs1409419_T were associated with stroke events, stroke risk, as measured by time-averaged mean of maximum velocity in the middle cerebral artery, and with high serum levels of the hemolysis biomarker lactate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, VCAM-1 ligand coding gene ITGA4 variants rs113276800_A and rs3770138_T showed a positive association with stroke events. An additional positive relationship between a genetic variant and stroke risk was observed for ENPP1 rs1044498_A. Conversely, NOS3 variants were negatively associated with silent cerebral infarct events (VNTR 4b_allele and haplotype V) and CV globally (haplotype VII). The -alpha3.7kb–thal deletion did not show association with CV. However, it was associated with higher red blood cell and neutrophil counts, and lower mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and red cell distribution width. Our results underline the importance of genetic modulators of the CV sub-phenotype and their potential as SCA therapeutic targets. We also propose that a biomarker panel comprising biochemical, hematological, imaging and genetic data would be instrumental for CV prediction, and prevention.

Abstract: Summary
CsPbI3 perovskite has drawn worldwide attention because of its thermal stability and outstanding photovoltaic performance. However, further improvement of CsPbI3 device performance is hindered by significant energy losses via charge-carrier recombination at the CsPbI3/transport layer interface and moisture sensitivity. Here, a beach-chair-shaped band structure is designed to introduce energy level gradients at both sides of the perovskite layer to steer optimal energy band alignment and heterojunction interface passivation in β-CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs), resulting in suppressed interfacial recombination, enhanced charge extraction, and more robust stability. As a result, champion solar cell efficiency is increased to as much as 17.12%, one of the highest in reported CsPbI3 PSCs, and the Voc of 1.15 V is among the highest reported values. Furthermore, bare PSCs without encapsulation retain 90.4% of their initial cell efficiency after being stored for 1 month under ambient conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Nature produces ∼170 billion tons of biomass per year; meanwhile, only a small percentage is used. Cellulose is the most abundant component in biomass; thus, the selective transformation of cellulose to high-value-added products is one of the most promising pathways to sustainable society. Here, we report an N-heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed umpolung of 5-(chloromethyl)furfural, which is easily obtained from cellulose, and its subsequent reaction with ketones is developed, giving the corresponding highly functionalized products in good yields. We believe that this carbene-catalyzed transformation of 5-(chloromethyl)furfural will facilitate the development of biomass transformations.

Abstract: Antithrombin (AT) reduction has been shown to improve thrombin generation (TG) in haemophilia with or without inhibitors. As treatment with bypassing agents (BPAs) may be required in patients with breakthrough bleeding while receiving AT-lowering therapy, we assessed TG in platelet-poor plasma samples from haemophilia patients in the presence of BPA (recombinant activated factor VII [rFVIIa; 1.25 or 2.5 μg mL−1] or activated prothrombin complex concentrate [aPCC; 0.5 or 1 U mL−1]) and AT reduction (anti-AT antibody). Mean ± SEM baseline peak thrombin height was 19.9 ± 4.3 nM in plasma from haemophilia patients (n = 12) and 230.5 ± 9.8 nM in healthy males (n = 24). Reduced AT improved mean peak thrombin height in haemophilia patient plasma to 75.4 ± 17.4 nM. Spiking of 90% AT-reduced haemophilia patient plasma with 2.5 μg mL−1 rFVIIa or 1 U mL−1 aPCC increased the mean peak thrombin height to 82.5 ± 12 nM and 134.8 ± 18.7 nM, respectively. Peak thrombin levels did not exceed the range for healthy volunteers when plasma samples from haemophilia patients with in vitro AT reduction were treated with BPAs, suggesting the potential use of BPAs in conjunction with AT reduction. Further clinical investigations are needed to confirm the safety of this approach.

Abstract: Background
Treatment of patients with hemophilia with an inhibitor is generally done using bypassing agents (BPA), wherein variability in response is observed. Due to lack of validated laboratory assays, monitoring is being carried out by clinical response only. Emerging biomarkers like procoagulant microparticles (MPs) may prove to be promising.
Aim
To analyze whether procoagulant MP levels correlate with clinical response to FEIBA therapy.
Materials and methods
Total phosphatidylserine (PS) expressing MPs along with different cell derived MPs were measured in blood samples obtained prior and 2 hour post-FEIBA infusion in 64 bleeding episodes associated with 43 severe hemophilia patients.
Results and discussion
Patients with excellent response showed statistically significant increase in %MP of PS-MPs (p < 0.0001; 95.0% CI Range: −64.33 to −24.42) when compared to those with moderate response; platelet %MP change was also found significantly associated (p < 0.05) with clinical response. In search of an assay for monitoring FEIBA, results though preliminary seem to be promising with increase in %PS-MP correlating well with the clinical response. Coagulation being multifactorial process involves multiple factors for balanced hemostasis, which needs to be accounted. Larger studies in this line may provide indications for usage of MPs as monitoring and dose adjustment tool of FEIBA therapy.

Abstract: Metastasis is the main cause of cancer related deaths, and unfolding the molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic progression is critical for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Notch is one of the key signaling pathways involved in breast tumorigenesis and metastasis. Notch activation induces pro-metastatic processes such as migration, invasion and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, molecular mediators working downstream of Notch in these processes are not fully elucidated. CYR61 is a secreted protein implicated in metastasis, and its inhibition by a monoclonal antibody suppresses metastasis in xenograft breast tumors, indicating the clinical importance of CYR61 targeting. Here, we aimed to investigate whether CYR61 works downstream of Notch in inducing pro-metastatic phenotypes in breast cells. We showed that CYR61 expression is positively regulated by Notch activity in breast cells. Notch1-induced migration, invasion and anchorage independent growth of a normal breast cell line, MCF10A, were abrogated by CYR61 silencing. Furthermore, upregulation of core EMT markers upon Notch1-activation was impaired in the absence of CYR61. However, reduced migration and invasion of highly metastatic cell line, MDA MB 231, cells upon Notch inhibition was not dependent on CYR61 downregulation. In conclusion, we showed that in normal breast cell line MCF10A, CYR61 is a mediator of Notch1-induced pro-metastatic phenotypes partly via induction of EMT. Our results imply CYR61 as a prominent therapeutic candidate for a subpopulation of breast tumors with high Notch activity.

Abstract: Summary
Windows play a crucial role in regulating solar energy exchange with a building, while supporting many essential functions, including natural daylighting, ventilation, and visual contact with the outside. These distinct functions often make complex and sometimes conflicting demands of solar energy. Here, we report a multicriteria Pareto optimization approach to obtain optimal balance of the energy-harvesting and energy-regulating functions for a smart window device. The optimal design is validated experimentally using a nanofabricated prototyping smart window device, which comprises a semi-transparent perovskite solar cell and an aperiodic multilayer nanophotonic coating. Based on experimental characterization of the prototype, calculations using EnergyPlus project an annual energy savings of 13,560 kWh or 187% over a chromogenic smart window for a 2,000-ft2 single-story residential building located in Phoenix, Arizona. The reported multicriteria optimization and the nanophotonic device architecture offer promising solutions for the efficient utilization of solar energy.

Abstract: Summary
Since the 1930s, surfactant-based air-entraining admixtures (AEAs) have been used to mitigate freeze-thaw damage in cementitious materials. While effective, entrained air voids weaken concrete and increase its permeability, thereby increasing susceptibility to multiple other forms of in situ degradation. Inspired by nature, we report that a soluble biomimetic antifreeze polymer that displays ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) and dynamic ice shaping (DIS) activities can prevent damage from ice crystal growth in cement paste and concrete. We first report that polyethylene glycol-graft-polyvinyl alcohol (PEG-PVA) mimics the explicit IRI and DIS activity of native ice-binding proteins in high-pH media characteristic of concrete pore solution. Second, we report that addition of PEG-PVA to cement paste and concrete prevents freeze-thaw damage without entraining air. Taken together, the findings demonstrate an alternative mechanistic approach to AEAs that can be leveraged to prevent damage from ice crystal growth in cementitious materials.

Abstract: Summary
Room temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries hold great promise as the next-generation cost-effective energy storage systems. However, their practical implementation is still plagued by the low reversible capacity of a bulk-sized commercial sulfur cathode with low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling stability. Here, we report a highly stable room temperature Na-S battery using a facile-processed, nanocarbon-promoted, bulk-sized commercial sulfur cathode and a polymer electrolyte. This processed nanocarbon possesses a high binding affinity to sulfur and polysulfides, largely facilitating the sulfur reaction kinetics and leading to high reversible capacity. Meanwhile, by applying a thin coating of the facile-processed nanocarbon on the polymer electrolyte, dead sulfur formation can be avoided, contributing to greatly enhanced capacity retention. Our Na-S battery delivers a reversible capacity of >700 mAh g−1 with near-100% Coulombic efficiency and the ultrahigh capacity retention of 98.2% at 0.2C after 200 cycles.

Abstract: Summary
The distillation of light gases requires significant energy inputs. Sorbents could alleviate this issue, but they must be able to separate molecules of similar size and chemical functionality. Here, we report the enhanced separations of gases such as propane and propylene using zeolite 5A modified with phosphonic acids (PAs) of varying alkyl tail length. All PAs slow the diffusion of n-C4H10 but generally have a smaller effect on the diffusion rate and loading of smaller molecules such as CO2 and CH4. However, methylphosphonic acid (C1PA) decreases by >90% both the diffusion rates and apparent equilibrium uptakes of n-C4H10 and C3H6. The achievable loadings of C3H6, C2H6, CH4, and CO2 are affected much less, resulting in a C3H6-C3H8 ideal selectivity of 59 ± 14. The unique effects of C1PA are correlated to a much higher extent of deposition near the zeolite surface, while longer-chain PAs are confined to a monolayer on the external surface.

Abstract: Summary
Implanting cell-laden microgels repairs soft tissue injuries, with the co-occurrence of tissue remodeling and angiogenesis in the engrafts. Engineering microgels using native-tissue derived materials, such as collagen, remains a challenge because they are mostly slow gelling and not angiogenic. Herein, we report a fast-gelling and angiogenic collagen scaffold interlocked by ultra-long DNA (>100,000 nt) programmed with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) aptamers. The DNA interlocking shortens the collagen gelation time by >30-fold, to 40 s and modulated by the microfluidic flows, but the viscoelasticity, biodegradability, and biochemical properties of native collagen remain unaltered. When encapsulated with cells, the angiogenic microgels improve wound healing and liver regeneration, compared with the non-angiogenic or acellular microgels. After cryopreservation, the cell-laden microgels are retrieved with >80% of the cells viable, and they retain their therapeutic potential. These angiogenic, fast-gelling, and ultra-soft cell-laden microgels may be promising candidates as injectable therapeutics in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: The Naegleria are ubiquitous free-living amoebae and are characterized by the presence of three phases in their biological cycle: trophozoite, cyst and flagellate. Of this genus, only Naegleria fowleri has been reported as pathogenic to humans. The proteasome is a multi-catalytic complex and is considered to be the most important structure responsible for the degradation of intracellular proteins. This structure is related to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and, in pathogenic microorganisms, to the modulation of their virulence. Until now, the proteasome and its function have not been described for the Naegleria genus. In the current study, using bioinformatic analysis, protein sequences homologous to those reported for the subunits of the 20S proteasome in other organisms were found, and virtual modelling was used to determine their three-dimensional structure. The presence of structural and catalytic subunits of the 20S proteasome was detected by Western and dot blot assays. Its localization was observed by immunofluorescence microscopy to be mainly in the cytoplasm, and a leading role of the chymotrypsin-like catalytic activity was determined using fluorogenic peptidase assays and specific proteasome inhibitors. Finally, the role of the 20S proteasome in the proliferation and differentiation of Naegleria genus trophozoites was demonstrated.

Abstract: Background
While there is a known association between low vitamin D levels and increased chronic pain in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), there are no reported studies evaluating the relationship of vitamin D levels and hospitalization outcomes in this population. The aim of this study was to assess this relationship with hospitalization outcomes defined as the number of emergency room (ER) visits, hospital admissions for pain crisis, and length of hospital stay.
Design
A retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients with SCD (1–21 years old) was performed from January 2015 to January 2016 in an urban-based hospital setting (n = 134). Those with at least one reported Vitamin D level who maintained follow up during the time studied were enrolled (n = 90). Patient hospitalizations rates were compared between vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) and sufficiency (>20 ng/ml).
Results
Patients with both SCD and vitamin D deficiency were more likely to have at least one Emergency Room visit (p < 0.01), at least one admission for pain crisis (p < 0.01), and a longer length of admission (p < 0.0001) when compared to patients with SCD and sufficient vitamin D levels.
Conclusion
There is a significant association between vitamin D levels of <20 ng/ml and the number of ER visits, hospital admissions for pain crisis, and length of stay in patients with SCD. Further research is required to assess if correcting vitamin D levels may improve hospitalization outcomes in this population.

Abstract: Summary
Discovering new inorganic photovoltaic materials becomes an efficient way for developing a new generation of solar cells with high efficiency and environmental stability. Using machine learning (ML) and density functional theory calculations, we report four promising inorganic photovoltaic materials—Ba4Te12Ge4, Ba8P8Ge4, Sr8P8Sn4, and Y4Te4Se2—demonstrating notable theoretical photovoltaic performance for use in solar cells. The symmetry-allowed optical transition probability, the large amount of density of states near the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM), and the strong p-p transition across the band edge contribute to the large optical absorption coefficient, leading to the outstanding theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE). The separation of the VBM and CBM wave function distributions contribute to the fast separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes and the enhanced carrier lifetimes. Our ML model is an efficient method for fast and atomic-level accuracy prediction of photovoltaic materials with different crystal structures.

Abstract: Summary
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have immense potential as sorbents and inorganic membranes for CO2 separation. However, the trade-off between selectivity and adsorption capacity or permeability remains a challenge. Here, we present the fabrication of MOF core-shell particles and dual-layer membranes that show enhanced CO2/N2 separation performance compared with individual MOF materials. A highly selective MOF layer with narrow pore size is grown on the surface of a highly permeable MOF layer with large pore size. Chemical binding at the interface between the two MOFs makes it possible to form a continuous defect-free shell layer on the surface of the core or base layer. The two dual-layer MOF@MOF membranes, SIFSIX-3-Ni@SIFSIX-1-Cu and SIFSIX-3-Ni@HKUST-1, represent the first examples of pure inorganic membranes constructed from different MOFs with lattice mismatch. The CO2/N2 selectivity of the HKUST-1 and SIFSIX-1-Cu membranes is improved from 5.7 to 13.4 and 2.3 to 7.4, respectively, after the growth of a selective layer of SIFSIX-3-Ni.

Abstract: Thalidomide has been shown to reactivate fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production and reduce the need for blood transfusions in β-thalassemia patients. However, some patients show a minor response or no response to thalidomide. In view of its potential side effects, targeted prescription of thalidomide is imperative. We initially aimed to explore the relevance of HBG2 (rs7482144), BCL11A (rs11886868, rs4671393, rs766432 and rs1427407) and HBS1L-MYB (rs9399137, rs4895440 and rs4895441) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in thalidomide response. Eight SNPs were investigated by PCR and DNA sequencing, and their roles in thalidomide response in Chinese β-thalassemia patients were assessed. Results demonstrated that minor alleles of four SNPs were associated with an increased main response risk (rs7482144: P = 0.015; rs9399137: OR = 4.911, P = 0.029; rs4895440: OR = 4.522, P = 0.040; and rs4895441: OR = 4.522, P = 0.040). For patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT), with an increase in the minor allele numbers of rs7482144 (P = 0.011), rs9399137 (P = 0.013), rs4895440 (P = 0.011) and rs4895441 (P = 0.011), Hb increments after treatment were increased significantly as well. The cumulative effects of patients carrying any combination of one or three significant minor alleles included a gradually increased main response risk compared to those without the significant minor alleles (P = 0.040–0.018, OR = 8.556–11.000). Furthermore, Hb increments after treatment correlated with cumulative numbers of minor alleles in the four significant SNPs among patients with NTDT (P = 0.001). It was demonstrated that SNPs in HBG2 and HBS1L-MYB contributed significantly to thalidomide response in Chinese patients with β-thalassemia and that the cumulative number of minor SNP alleles may serve as good predictors of treatment response in this population.

Abstract: Background
We aimed to investigate the association of bone marrow mast cell numbers (MCN) and the degree of reticulin fibrosis in patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).
Methods
This was a case-control study that recruited 47 patients who were diagnosed with bcr-abl negative MPN. Thirty patients with lymphoma served as controls. JAK2 mutation was studied and all subjects underwent bone marrow biopsy at the time of diagnosis. Mast and CD34+ cells were counted. Marrow reticulin fiber was graded.
Results
Thirty-four patients had essential thrombocythemia (ET), 8 patients had primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and 5 patients had polycythemia vera (PV). Fourteen MPN patients had JAK2, whereas the controls had not. MCN was higher in patients than controls (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference regarding CD34. Reticulin fibrosis was present in 57.4% of MPN patients, whereas there was any in controls. PMF patients had more CD34 + cells than PV and ET. PMF patients had more reticulin fibers compared with other subgroups (p < 0.001). MCN, but not CD34+ cell counts, was significantly higher in JAK2(+) patients than JAK2(−) patients.
Conclusion
MCN and reticulin fibrosis were significantly increased in MPN patients. JAK2 positivity had significantly increased MCN compared to patients without JAK2. JAK2 was associated with increased reticulin fibrosis.

Abstract: There is a paucity of information on a potential role for the IL-33 receptor/ST2 in the regulation of mouse bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem (HSC) and progenitor (HPC) cells. Comparing the BM of st2−/− and wild type (WT) control mice using functional assays, it was found that st2−/− BM cells had poorer engrafting capacity than WT BM in a competitive repopulating assay using congenic mice, with no changes in reconstitution of B-, T- and myeloid cells following transplantation. The BM of st2−/− mice also had fewer granulocyte-macrophage, erythroid, and multipotential progenitors than that of WT BM and these st2−/− HPC were in a slow cycling state compared to that of the rapidly cycling HPC of the WT mice. While functional assessment of HSC and HPC demonstrated that ST2 has a positive influence on regulation of HSC, we could not pick up differences in st2−/− compared to WT BM using only phenotypic analysis of HSC and HPC populations prior to transplantation, again demonstrating that phenotypic analysis of HSC and HPC do not always recapitulate the functional assessments of these immature hematopoietic cells.
