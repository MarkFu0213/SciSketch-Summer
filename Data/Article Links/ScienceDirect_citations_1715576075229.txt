Abstract: Summary
The coordination of chloroplast and nuclear genome status is critical for plant cell function. Here, we report that Arabidopsis CHLOROPLAST AND NUCLEUS DUAL-LOCALIZED PROTEIN 1 (CND1) maintains genome stability in the chloroplast and the nucleus. CND1 localizes to both compartments, and complete loss of CND1 results in embryo lethality. Partial loss of CND1 disturbs nuclear cell-cycle progression and photosynthetic activity. CND1 binds to nuclear pre-replication complexes and DNA replication origins and regulates nuclear genome stability. In chloroplasts, CND1 interacts with and facilitates binding of the regulator of chloroplast genome stability WHY1 to chloroplast DNA. The defects in nuclear cell-cycle progression and photosynthesis of cnd1 mutants are respectively rescued by compartment-restricted CND1 localization. Light promotes the association of CND1 with HSP90 and its import into chloroplasts. This study provides a paradigm of the convergence of genome status across organelles to coordinately regulate cell cycle to control plant growth and development.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue modulates energy homeostasis by secreting leptin, but little is known about the factors governing leptin production. We show that succinate, long perceived as a mediator of immune response and lipolysis, controls leptin expression via its receptor SUCNR1. Adipocyte-specific deletion of Sucnr1 influences metabolic health according to nutritional status. Adipocyte Sucnr1 deficiency impairs leptin response to feeding, whereas oral succinate mimics nutrient-related leptin dynamics via SUCNR1. SUCNR1 activation controls leptin expression via the circadian clock in an AMPK/JNK-C/EBPα-dependent manner. Although the anti-lipolytic role of SUCNR1 prevails in obesity, its function as a regulator of leptin signaling contributes to the metabolically favorable phenotype in adipocyte-specific Sucnr1 knockout mice under standard dietary conditions. Obesity-associated hyperleptinemia in humans is linked to SUCNR1 overexpression in adipocytes, which emerges as the major predictor of adipose tissue leptin expression. Our study establishes the succinate/SUCNR1 axis as a metabolite-sensing pathway mediating nutrient-related leptin dynamics to control whole-body homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
AT-rich interaction domain 3 (ARID3) transcription factors are expressed in the nervous system, but their mechanisms of action are largely unknown. Here, we provide, in vivo, a genome-wide binding map for CFI-1, the sole C. elegans ARID3 ortholog. We identify 6,396 protein-coding genes as putative direct targets of CFI-1, most of which encode neuronal terminal differentiation markers. In head sensory neurons, CFI-1 directly activates multiple terminal differentiation genes, thereby acting as a terminal selector. In motor neurons, however, CFI-1 acts as a direct repressor, continuously antagonizing three transcriptional activators. By focusing on the glr-4/GRIK4 glutamate receptor locus, we identify proximal CFI-1 binding sites and histone methyltransferase activity as necessary for glr-4 repression. Rescue assays reveal functional redundancy between core and extended DNA-binding ARID domains and a strict requirement for REKLES, the ARID3 oligomerization domain. Altogether, this study uncovers cell-context-dependent mechanisms through which a single ARID3 protein controls the terminal differentiation of distinct neuron types.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) controls expression of all protein-coding genes and most noncoding loci in higher eukaryotes. Calibrating RNAPII activity requires an assortment of polymerase-associated factors that are recruited at sites of active transcription. The Integrator complex is one of the most elusive transcriptional regulators in metazoans, deemed to be recruited after initiation to help establish and modulate paused RNAPII. Integrator is known to be composed of 14 subunits that assemble and operate in a modular fashion. We employed proteomics and machine-learning structure prediction (AlphaFold2) to identify an additional Integrator subunit, INTS15. We report that INTS15 assembles primarily with the INTS13/14/10 module and interfaces with the Int-PP2A module. Functional genomics analysis further reveals a role for INTS15 in modulating RNAPII pausing at a subset of genes. Our study shows that omics approaches combined with AlphaFold2-based predictions provide additional insights into the molecular architecture of large and dynamic multiprotein complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Decision making often depends on vague information that leads to uncertainty, which is a quantity contingent not on choice but on probability distributions of sensory evidence and other cognitive variables. Uncertainty may be computed in parallel and interact with decision making. Here, we adapt the classic random-dot motion direction discrimination task to allow subjects to indicate their uncertainty without having to form a decision first. The subjects’ choices and reaction times for perceptual decisions and uncertainty responses are measured, respectively. We then build a value-based model in which decisions are based on optimizing value computed from a drift-diffusion process. The model accounts for key features of subjects’ behavior and the variation across the individuals. It explains how the addition of the uncertainty option affects perceptual decision making. Our work establishes a value-based theoretical framework for studying uncertainty and perceptual decisions that can be readily applied in future investigations of the underlying neural mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Appropriate cytoskeletal organization is essential for vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) conditions such as hypertension. This study identifies FXR1 as a key protein linking cytoskeletal dynamics with mRNA stability. RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) in human VSMCs identifies that FXR1 binds to mRNA associated with cytoskeletal dynamics, and FXR1 depletion decreases their mRNA stability. FXR1 binds and regulates actin polymerization. Mass spectrometry identifies that FXR1 interacts with cytoskeletal proteins, particularly Arp2, a protein crucial for VSMC contraction, and CYFIP1, a WASP family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC) protein that links mRNA processing with actin polymerization. Depletion of FXR1 decreases the cytoskeletal processes of adhesion, migration, contraction, and GTPase activation. Using telemetry, conditional FXR1SMC/SMC mice have decreased blood pressure and an abundance of cytoskeletal-associated transcripts. This indicates that FXR1 is a muscle-enhanced WRC modulatory protein that regulates VSMC cytoskeletal dynamics by regulation of cytoskeletal mRNA stability and actin polymerization and cytoskeletal protein-protein interactions, which can regulate blood pressure.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical allodynia (MA) represents one prevalent symptom of chronic pain. Previously we and others have identified spinal and brain circuits that transmit or modulate the initial establishment of MA. However, brain-derived descending pathways that control the laterality and duration of MA are still poorly understood. Here we report that the contralateral brain-to-spinal circuits, from Oprm1 neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBNOprm1), via Pdyn neurons in the dorsal medial regions of hypothalamus (dmHPdyn), to the spinal dorsal horn (SDH), act to prevent nerve injury from inducing contralateral MA and reduce the duration of bilateral MA induced by capsaicin. Ablating/silencing dmH-projecting lPBNOprm1 neurons or SDH-projecting dmHPdyn neurons, deleting Dyn peptide from dmH, or blocking spinal κ-opioid receptors all led to long-lasting bilateral MA. Conversely, activation of dmHPdyn neurons or their axonal terminals in SDH can suppress sustained bilateral MA induced by lPBN lesion.

Abstract: Hematopoiesis occurs in different anatomical niches throughout the life of the individual. The first hematopoietic extra-embryonic stage is replaced by a intra-embryonic stage that occurs in a region that is adjacent to the dorsal aorta. Then, the prenatal hematopoietic function is continued by the liver and spleen, and later by the bone marrow. The objective of the present work was to describe the morphological characteristics of hepatic hematopoiesis in the alpaca and to analyze the proportion of the hematopoietic compartment of the organ and the cell types, at different times of ontogeny. Sixty-two alpaca samples were collected from the municipal slaughterhouse of Huancavelica, Perú. They were processed by routine histological techniques. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, special dyes, immunohistochemical techniques and supplementary analyses by lectinhistochemistry, were performed. The prenatal liver is an important structure in the expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Their hematopoietic activity was characterized by four stages: initiation, expansion, peak, and involution. The liver started its hematopoietic function at 21 days EGA and it was maintained until shortly before birth. Differences were found in the proportion and morphology of the hematopoietic tissue in the different groups corresponding to each gestational stage.

Abstract: Summary
Continuous plant growth is achieved by cell division and cell elongation. Brassinosteroids control cell elongation and differentiation throughout plant life. However, signaling cascades underlying BR-mediated cell elongation are unknown. In this study, we introduce cotton fiber, one of the most representative single-celled tissues, to decipher cell-specific BR signaling. We find that gain of function of GhBES1, a key transcriptional activator in BR signaling, enhances fiber elongation. The chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis identifies a cell-elongation-related protein, GhCERP, whose transcription is directly activated by GhBES1. GhCERP, a downstream target of GhBES1, transmits the GhBES1-mediated BR signaling to its target gene, GhEXPA3-1. Ultimately, GhEXPA3-1 promotes fiber cell elongation. In addition, inter-species functional analysis of the BR-mediated BES1-CERP-EXPA3 signaling cascade also promotes Arabidopsis root and hypocotyl growth. We propose that the BES1-CERP-EXPA3 module may be a broad-spectrum pathway that is universally exploited by diverse plant species to regulate BR-promoted cell elongation.

Abstract: Down syndrome (DS) is the most common autosomal aneuploidy caused by trisomy of chromosome 21. Previous studies demonstrated that DS affected mitochondrial functions, which may be associated with the abnormal development of the nervous system in patients with DS. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is an encoding gene located on chromosome 21. It has been reported that RUNX1 may affect cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. The present study investigated whether RUNX1 plays a critical role in mitochondrial dysfunction in DS and explored the mechanism by which RUNX1 affects mitochondrial functions. Expression of RUNX1 was detected in induced pluripotent stem cells of patients with DS (DS-iPSCs) and normal iPSCs (N-iPSCs), and the mitochondrial functions were investigated in the current study. Subsequently, RUNX1 was overexpressed in N-iPSCs and inhibited in DS-iPSCs. The mitochondrial functions were investigated thoroughly, including reactive oxygen species levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP content, and lysosomal activity. Finally, RNA-sequencing was used to explore the global expression pattern. It was observed that the expression levels of RUNX1 in DS-iPSCs were significantly higher than those in normal controls. Impaired mitochondrial functions were observed in DS-iPSCs. Of note, overexpression of RUNX1 in N-iPSCs resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, while inhibition of RUNX1 expression could improve the mitochondrial function in DS-iPSCs. Global gene expression analysis indicated that overexpression of RUNX1 may promote the induction of apoptosis in DS-iPSCs by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The present findings indicate that abnormal expression of RUNX1 may play a critical role in mitochondrial dysfunction in DS-iPSCs.

Abstract: Objective
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and painful joint disease with multifactorial causes. Stem cells, due to their high ability to reproduce and differentiate, have created a new horizon in tissue engineering of cartilage and bone. Secretions are one of the new therapies that can be used with stem cells or separately. This study aimed to compare the healing effects of human dental pulp stem cells, cell-free secretome, and human dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells with secretome in the induced OA in male rats.
Methods
Dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and prepared from human dental pulp. The collagenase type II was injected into the knee of twenty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats, and after 10 weeks, OA was confirmed. Rats were divided into five groups (n = 5): 1) Human dental pulp stem cells plus secretome (HDP+Sec); 2) Human dental pulp stem cells (HDP); 3) Secretome (Sec); 4) Hyalgan as the positive control (Hya); 5) No treatment as the negative control (Ctrl). After 12 weeks since OA was confirmed, the healing process was examined by histopathology and radiology evaluations.
Results
Histopathological evaluations, radiological assessments, and matrix indexes in three treatment groups significantly improved compared to the Ctrl and Hya groups. Surface in HDP+Sec was significantly better than the Ctrl group. In radiological evaluations, a significant decrease in OA was observed in the three treatment groups in comparison with the Ctrl groups. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in any radiological and histopathological evaluations. HDP + Sec group slightly records better results compared to Sec or HDP treatment groups.
Conclusion
It was concluded that human dental pulp stem cells and their secretome promote cartilage regeneration due to their cell protective potential as well as matrix degeneration reduction capacity.

Abstract: Summary
The basement membrane (BM) around tumor lobes forms a barrier to prevent cancer cells from invading the surrounding tissue. Although myoepithelial cells are key producers of the healthy mammary epithelium BM, they are nearly absent in mammary tumors. To study the origin and dynamics of the BM, we developed and imaged a laminin beta1-Dendra2 mouse model. We show that the turnover of laminin beta1 is faster in the BMs that surround the tumor lobes than in the BMs that surround the healthy epithelium. Moreover, we find that epithelial cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating endothelial cells synthesize laminin beta1 and that this production is temporarily and locally heterogeneous, leading to local discontinuity of the BM laminin beta1. Collectively, our data draw a new paradigm for tumor BM turnover in which the disassembly happens at a constant rate, and a local misbalance of compensating production leads to reduction or even complete disappearance of the BM.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we ask how developing precursors maintain the balance between cell genesis for tissue growth and establishment of adult stem cell pools, focusing on postnatal forebrain neural precursor cells (NPCs). We show that these NPCs are transcriptionally primed to differentiate and that the primed mRNAs are associated with the translational repressor 4E-T. 4E-T also broadly associates with other NPC mRNAs encoding transcriptional regulators, and these are preferentially depleted from ribosomes, consistent with repression. By contrast, a second translational regulator, Cpeb4, associates with diverse target mRNAs that are largely ribosome associated. The 4E-T-dependent mRNA association is functionally important because 4E-T knockdown or conditional knockout derepresses proneurogenic mRNA translation and perturbs maintenance versus differentiation of early postnatal NPCs in culture and in vivo. Thus, early postnatal NPCs are primed to differentiate, and 4E-T regulates the balance between cell genesis and stem cell expansion by sequestering and repressing mRNAs encoding transcriptional regulators.

Abstract: Summary
Recent literature suggests that tactile events are represented in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) beyond its long-established topography; in addition, the extent to which S1 is modulated by vision remains unclear. To better characterize S1, human electrophysiological data were recorded during touches to the forearm or finger. Conditions included visually observed physical touches, physical touches without vision, and visual touches without physical contact. Two major findings emerge from this dataset. First, vision strongly modulates S1 area 1, but only if there is a physical element to the touch, suggesting that passive touch observation is insufficient to elicit neural responses. Second, despite recording in a putative arm area of S1, neural activity represents both arm and finger stimuli during physical touches. Arm touches are encoded more strongly and specifically, supporting the idea that S1 encodes tactile events primarily through its topographic organization but also more generally, encompassing other areas of the body.

Abstract: Summary
Maladaptation of host-microbiota metabolic interplay plays a critical role in colorectal cancer initiation. Here, through a combination of single-cell transcriptomics, microbiome profiling, metabonomics, and clinical analysis on colorectal adenoma and carcinoma tissues, we demonstrate that host’s urea cycle metabolism is significantly activated during colorectal tumorigenesis, accompanied by the absence of beneficial bacteria with ureolytic capacity, such as Bifidobacterium, and the overabundance of pathogenic bacteria lacking ureolytic function. Urea could enter into macrophages, inhibit the binding efficiency of p-STAT1 to SAT1 promotor region, and further skew macrophages toward a pro-tumoral phenotype characterized by the accumulation of polyamines. Treating a murine model using urea cycle inhibitors or Bifidobacterium-based supplements could mitigate urea-mediated tumorigenesis. Collectively, this study highlights the utility of urea cycle inhibitors or therapeutically manipulating microbial composition using probiotics to prevent colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Adrenal cortex and gonads represent the two major steroidogenic organs in mammals. Both tissues are considered to share a common developmental origin characterized by the expression of Nr5a1/Sf1. The precise origin of adrenogonadal progenitors and the processes driving differentiation toward the adrenal or gonadal fate remain, however, elusive. Here, we provide a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of early mouse adrenogonadal development including 52 cell types belonging to twelve major cell lineages. Trajectory reconstruction reveals that adrenogonadal cells emerge from the lateral plate rather than the intermediate mesoderm. Surprisingly, we find that gonadal and adrenal fates have already diverged prior to Nr5a1 expression. Finally, lineage separation into gonadal and adrenal fates involves canonical versus non-canonical Wnt signaling and differential expression of Hox patterning genes. Thus, our study provides important insights into the molecular programs of adrenal and gonadal fate choice and will be a valuable resource for further research into adrenogonadal ontogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Recent clinical trials revealed that immune checkpoint inhibitors and antiangiogenic reagent combination therapy improved the prognosis of various cancers. We investigated the roles of fibrocytes, collagen-producing monocyte-derived cells, in combination immunotherapy. Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) antibody increases tumor-infiltrating fibrocytes and enhances the antitumor effects of anti-PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) antibody in vivo. Single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor-infiltrating CD45+ cells identifies a distinct “fibrocyte cluster” from “macrophage clusters” in vivo and in lung adenocarcinoma patients. A sub-clustering analysis reveals a fibrocyte sub-cluster that highly expresses co-stimulatory molecules. CD8+ T cell-costimulatory activity of tumor-infiltrating CD45+CD34+ fibrocytes is enhanced by anti-PD-L1 antibody. Peritumoral implantation of fibrocytes enhances the antitumor effect of PD-L1 blockade in vivo; CD86−/− fibrocytes do not. Tumor-infiltrating fibrocytes acquire myofibroblast-like phenotypes through transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/small mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) signaling. Thus, TGF-βR/SMAD inhibitor enhances the antitumor effects of dual VEGF and PD-L1 blockade by regulating fibrocyte differentiation. Fibrocytes are highlighted as regulators of the response to programmed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 blockade.

Abstract: Summary
Drugs targeting microtubules rely on the mitotic checkpoint to arrest cell proliferation. The prolonged mitotic arrest induced by such drugs is followed by a G1 arrest. Here, we follow for several weeks the fate of G1-arrested human cells after treatment with nocodazole. We find that a small fraction of cells escapes from the arrest and resumes proliferation. These escaping cells experience reduced DNA damage and p21 activation. Cells surviving treatment are enriched for anti-apoptotic proteins, including Triap1. Increasing Triap1 levels allows cells to survive the first treatment with reduced DNA damage and lower levels of p21; accordingly, decreasing Triap1 re-sensitizes cells to nocodazole. We show that Triap1 upregulation leads to the retention of cytochrome c in the mitochondria, opposing the partial activation of caspases caused by nocodazole. In summary, our results point to a potential role of Triap1 upregulation in the emergence of resistance to drugs that induce prolonged mitotic arrest.

Abstract: Summary
Sleep is regulated by peripheral tissues under fatigue. The molecular pathways in peripheral cells that trigger systemic sleep-related signals, however, are unclear. Here, a forward genetic screen in C. elegans identifies 3 genes that strongly affect sleep amount: sel-1, sel-11, and mars-1. sel-1 and sel-11 encode endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation components, whereas mars-1 encodes methionyl-tRNA synthetase. We find that these machineries function in non-neuronal tissues and that the ER unfolded protein response components inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)/XBP1 and protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK)/eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α)/activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) participate in non-neuronal sleep regulation, partly by reducing global translation. Neuronal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is also required. Mouse studies suggest that this mechanism is conserved in mammals. Considering that prolonged wakefulness increases ER proteostasis stress in peripheral tissues, our results suggest that peripheral ER proteostasis factors control sleep homeostasis. Moreover, based on our results, peripheral tissues likely cope with ER stress not only by the well-established cell-autonomous mechanisms but also by promoting the individual’s sleep.

Abstract: Summary
Auxilin participates in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), thereby facilitating synaptic vesicle (SV) regeneration at presynaptic sites. Auxilin (DNAJC6/PARK19) loss-of-function mutations cause early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we utilized auxilin knockout (KO) mice to elucidate the mechanisms through which auxilin deficiency and clathrin-uncoating deficits lead to PD. Auxilin KO mice display cardinal features of PD, including progressive motor deficits, α-synuclein pathology, nigral dopaminergic loss, and neuroinflammation. Significantly, treatment with L-DOPA ameliorated motor deficits. Unbiased proteomic and neurochemical analyses of auxilin KO brains indicated dopamine dyshomeostasis. We validated these findings by demonstrating slower dopamine reuptake kinetics in vivo, an effect associated with dopamine transporter misrouting into axonal membrane deformities in the dorsal striatum. Defective SV protein sorting and elevated synaptic autophagy also contribute to ineffective dopamine sequestration and compartmentalization, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. This study provides insights into how presynaptic endocytosis deficits lead to dopaminergic vulnerability and pathogenesis of PD.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic state represents a major hurdle for an effective adoptive T cell therapy (ACT). Indeed, specific lipids can harm CD8+ T cell (CTL) mitochondrial integrity, leading to defective antitumor responses. However, the extent to which lipids can affect the CTL functions and fate remains unexplored. Here, we show that linoleic acid (LA) is a major positive regulator of CTL activity by improving metabolic fitness, preventing exhaustion, and stimulating a memory-like phenotype with superior effector functions. We report that LA treatment enhances the formation of ER-mitochondria contacts (MERC), which in turn promotes calcium (Ca2+) signaling, mitochondrial energetics, and CTL effector functions. As a direct consequence, the antitumor potency of LA-instructed CD8 T cells is superior in vitro and in vivo. We thus propose LA treatment as an ACT potentiator in tumor therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The X chromosome in non-African humans shows less diversity and less Neanderthal introgression than expected from neutral evolution. Analyzing 162 human male X chromosomes worldwide, we identified fourteen chromosomal regions where nearly identical haplotypes spanning several hundred kilobases are found at high frequencies in non-Africans. Genetic drift alone cannot explain the existence of these haplotypes, which must have been associated with strong positive selection in partial selective sweeps. Moreover, the swept haplotypes are entirely devoid of archaic ancestry as opposed to the non-swept haplotypes in the same genomic regions. The ancient Ust'-Ishim male dated at 45,000 before the present (BP) also carries the swept haplotypes, implying that selection on the haplotypes must have occurred between 45,000 and 55,000 years ago. Finally, we find that the chromosomal positions of sweeps overlap previously reported hotspots of selective sweeps in great ape evolution, suggesting a mechanism of selection unique to X chromosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Hallucinations limit widespread therapeutic use of psychedelics as rapidly acting antidepressants. Here we profiled the non-hallucinogenic lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) analog 2-bromo-LSD (2-Br-LSD) at more than 33 aminergic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 2-Br-LSD shows partial agonism at several aminergic GPCRs, including 5-HT2A, and does not induce the head-twitch response (HTR) in mice, supporting its classification as a non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A partial agonist. Unlike LSD, 2-Br-LSD lacks 5-HT2B agonism, an effect linked to cardiac valvulopathy. Additionally, 2-Br-LSD produces weak 5-HT2A β-arrestin recruitment and internalization in vitro and does not induce tolerance in vivo after repeated administration. 2-Br-LSD induces dendritogenesis and spinogenesis in cultured rat cortical neurons and increases active coping behavior in mice, an effect blocked by the 5-HT2A-selective antagonist volinanserin (M100907). 2-Br-LSD also reverses the behavioral effects of chronic stress. Overall, 2-Br-LSD has an improved pharmacological profile compared with LSD and may have profound therapeutic value for mood disorders and other indications.

Abstract: Summary
The arginine dependency of cancer cells creates metabolic vulnerability. In this study, we examine the impact of arginine availability on DNA replication and genotoxicity resistance. Using DNA combing assays, we find that limiting extracellular arginine results in the arrest of cancer cells at S phase and a slowing or stalling of DNA replication. The translation of new histone H4 is arginine dependent and influences DNA replication. Increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) occupancy and helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF)-catalyzed PCNA K63-linked polyubiquitination protect arginine-starved cells from DNA damage. Arginine-deprived cancer cells display tolerance to genotoxicity in a PCNA K63-linked polyubiquitination-dependent manner. Our findings highlight the crucial role of extracellular arginine in nutrient-regulated DNA replication and provide potential avenues for the development of cancer treatments.

Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder affecting women at reproductive age. The therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on PCOS has been revealed, while the anti-PCOS mechanisms of EA have not been fully explored. In this study, PCOS were induced in rats by daily injection with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for 20 days and EA treatment was performed for 5 weeks. The mRNA expression profiles in ovarian tissues from control, PCOS, and EA-treated rats were examined by high-throughput mRNA sequencing. 5'-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (Alas2), a vital rate-limiting enzyme of the heme synthesis pathway, was selected to be further studied. PCOS led to the upregulation of Alas2 mRNA, whereas EA treatment restored this change. In vitro, primary ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) were challenged with H2O2 to mimic the oxidative stress (OS) state in PCOS. H2O2 induced apoptosis, OS, mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as Alas2 overexpression in GCs, while lentivirus-mediated Alas2 knockdown evidently restrained the above impairments. In summary, this study highlights the crucial role of Alas2 in cell apoptosis, OS, and mitochondrial dysfunction of PCOS GCs and provides potential therapeutic candidates for further investigation on PCOS treatment.

Abstract: Dysregulation of 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) occurs in metabolic disorders including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which makes it a molecular target for treatment. An AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) alleviates NAFLD in experimental rats, however the specific mechanism remains to be explored. We aimed to study the effect of AICAR on lipid levels, oxidant-antioxidant balance, AMPK and mTOR activation and FOXO3 gene expression in liver of mice model. Fatty liver was induced in two groups of C57BL/6 mice (groups 2 and 3) by providing a high fat high fructose diet (HFFD) for 10 weeks while groups 1 and 4 animals were fed normal pellet. For the last two weeks, groups 3 and 4 were administered AICAR (150 mg/kg bw/day, i.p.) while groups 1 and 2 were administered saline. AICAR decreased fatty liver, decreased glucose and insulin in circulation, prevented the accumulation of triglycerides and collagen and ameliorated oxidative stress in HFFD fed mice. At the molecular level, AICAR upregulated FOXO3 and p-AMPK expression and reduced p-mTOR expression. AMPK activation may involve FOXO3 in protection against NAFLD. The role of AMPK, mTOR and FOXO3 crosstalk in NAFLD needs to be characterised in future.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality. DHRS2-modified human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (hUC-MSCs-derived exos) function in PCa. We explored the mechanism of DHRS2-modified hUC-MSCs-derived exos in PCa cell malignant behaviors. DHRS2 expression levels in WPMY-1 cells and 4 PCa cell lines were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. 22Rv1/DU145 cells with high/low DHRS2 expression were selected to establish the low/high DHRS2 expression models by transfection. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8, colony formation assays, and flow cytometry. hUC-MSCs were identified by oil red O, alizarin staining, and flow cytometry. Exos were extracted from hUC-MSCs by ultracentrifugation and identified by transmission electron microscopy, Nano series-Nano-ZS, and Western blot. DU145 cells were selected for in vitro study to further study the effects of DHRS2-modified exos on cell proliferation and apoptosis. The effect of DHRS2-modified exos on cell cycle distribution was detected by flow cytometry. DHRS2 was repressed in PCa cells. DHRS2 overexpression suppressed PCa cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Exos were successfully isolated from hUC-MSC. DHRS2-modified hUC-MSCs-derived exos carried DHRS2 into PCa cells and blocked malignant behaviors. Briefly, DHRS2 was repressed in PCa cells. DHRS2-modified hUC-MSCs-derived exos blocked PCa cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying tumor cell PD-L1 (tPD-L1) function in tumor immune evasion are incompletely understood. We report here that tPD-L1 does not suppress cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in co-cultures of tumor cells and tumor-specific CTLs and exhibits no effect on primary tumor growth. However, deleting tPD-L1 decreases lung metastasis in a CTL-dependent manner in tumor-bearing mice. Depletion of myeloid cells or knocking out PD-1 in myeloid cells (mPD-1) impairs tPD-L1 promotion of tumor lung metastasis in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals that tPD-L1 engages mPD-1 to activate SHP2 to antagonize the type I interferon (IFN-I) and STAT1 pathway to repress Cxcl9 and impair CTL recruitment to lung metastases. Human cancer patient response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy correlates with IFN-I response in myeloid cells. Our findings determine that tPD-L1 engages mPD-1 to activate SHP2 to suppress the IFN-I-STAT1-CXCL9 pathway to impair CTL tumor recruitment in lung metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
With age, skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) activate out of quiescence more slowly and with increased death, leading to defective muscle repair. To explore the molecular underpinnings of these defects, we combined multiomics, single-cell measurements, and functional testing of MuSCs from young and old mice. The multiomics approach allowed us to assess which changes are causal, which are compensatory, and which are simply correlative. We identified glutathione (GSH) metabolism as perturbed in old MuSCs, with both causal and compensatory components. Contrary to young MuSCs, old MuSCs exhibit a population dichotomy composed of GSHhigh cells (comparable with young MuSCs) and GSHlow cells with impaired functionality. Mechanistically, we show that antagonism between NRF2 and NF-κB maintains this bimodality. Experimental manipulation of GSH levels altered the functional dichotomy of aged MuSCs. These findings identify a novel mechanism of stem cell aging and highlight glutathione metabolism as an accessible target for reversing MuSC aging.

Abstract: Summary
The cell cycle is key to life. After decades of research, it is unclear whether any parts of this process have yet to be identified. Fam72a is a poorly characterized gene and is evolutionarily conserved across multicellular organisms. Here, we have found that Fam72a is a cell-cycle-regulated gene that is transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated by FoxM1 and APC/C, respectively. Functionally, Fam72a directly binds to tubulin and both the Aα and B56 subunits of PP2A-B56 to modulate tubulin and Mcl1 phosphorylation, which in turn affects the progression of the cell cycle and signaling of apoptosis. Moreover, Fam72a is involved in early responses to chemotherapy, and it efficiently antagonizes various anticancer compounds such as CDK and Bcl2 inhibitors. Thus, Fam72a switches the tumor-suppressive PP2A to be oncogenic by reprogramming its substrates. These findings identify a regulatory axis of PP2A and a protein member in the cell cycle and tumorigenesis regulatory network in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
The African trypanosome survives the immune response of its mammalian host by antigenic variation of its major surface antigen (the variant surface glycoprotein or VSG). Here we describe the antibody repertoires elicited by different VSGs. We show that the repertoires are highly restricted and are directed predominantly to distinct epitopes on the surface of the VSGs. They are also highly discriminatory; minor alterations within these exposed epitopes confer antigenically distinct properties to these VSGs and elicit different repertoires. We propose that the patterned and repetitive nature of the VSG coat focuses host immunity to a restricted set of immunodominant epitopes per VSG, eliciting a highly stereotyped response, minimizing cross-reactivity between different VSGs and facilitating prolonged immune evasion through epitope variation.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic background drives phenotypic variability in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Most studies to date have used transcript abundance as the primary molecular readout of cell state in PSCs. We performed a comprehensive proteogenomics analysis of 190 genetically diverse mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines. The quantitative proteome is highly variable across lines, and we identified pluripotency-associated pathways that were differentially activated in the proteomics data that were not evident in transcriptome data from the same lines. Integration of protein abundance to transcript levels and chromatin accessibility revealed broad co-variation across molecular layers as well as shared and unique drivers of quantitative variation in pluripotency-associated pathways. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping localized the drivers of these multi-omic signatures to genomic hotspots. This study reveals post-transcriptional mechanisms and genetic interactions that underlie quantitative variability in the pluripotent proteome and provides a regulatory map for mESCs that can provide a basis for future mechanistic studies.

Abstract: Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a type of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that poses a serious threat to the health of both mother and fetus. Inhibition of the inflammatory environment on trophoblast cells is of great significance to improve PE. Apelin-36 is an endogenous active peptide with strong anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of Apelin-36 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced trophoblast cells and its potential mechanism. The levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6 and MCP-1) were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion capacities in trophoblast cells were detected by CCK-8, TUNEL staining, wound healing and Transwell assays, respectively. GRP78 was overexpressed by cell transfection. Western blot was applied for the identification of protein levels. Apelin concentration-dependently decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines and p-p65 protein level in trophoblast cells induced by LPS. Apelin treatment reduced LPS-induced apoptosis and improved the proliferation, invasion and migration capacities of LPS-mediated trophoblast cells. Additionally, Apelin down-regulated GRP78, p-ASK1 and p-JNK protein levels. The inhibition on LPS-induced trophoblast cell apoptosis and the promotion on invasion and migration by Apelin-36 was counteracted by GRP78 overexpression. To sum up, Apelin-36 could alleviate LPS-induced cell inflammation and apoptosis and improve the invasion and migration of trophoblasts by inhibiting the GRP78/ASK1/JNK signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The laminae of the neocortex are fundamental processing layers of the mammalian brain. Notably, such laminae are believed to be relatively stereotyped across short spatial scales such that shared laminae between nearby brain regions exhibit similar constituent cells. Here, we consider a potential exception to this rule by studying the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a brain region known for sharp cytoarchitectonic differences across its granular-dysgranular border. Using a variety of transcriptomics techniques, we identify, spatially map, and interpret the excitatory cell-type landscape of the mouse RSC. In doing so, we uncover that RSC gene expression and cell types change sharply at the granular-dysgranular border. Additionally, supposedly homologous laminae between the RSC and the neocortex are effectively wholly distinct in their cell-type composition. In collection, the RSC exhibits a variety of intrinsic cell-type specializations and embodies an organizational principle wherein cell-type identities can vary sharply within and between brain regions.

Abstract: Summary
Functional connectivity (FC) can provide insight into cortical circuit dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, dynamic changes in FC related to locomotion with sensory feedback remain to be elucidated. To investigate FC dynamics in locomoting mice, we develop mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging with a virtual reality (VR) environment. We find rapid reorganization of cortical FC in response to changing behavioral states. By using machine learning classification, behavioral states are accurately decoded. We then use our VR-based imaging system to study cortical FC in a mouse model of autism and find that locomotion states are associated with altered FC dynamics. Furthermore, we identify FC patterns involving the motor area as the most distinguishing features of the autism mice from wild-type mice during behavioral transitions, which might correlate with motor clumsiness in individuals with autism. Our VR-based real-time imaging system provides crucial information to understand FC dynamics linked to behavioral abnormality of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Current approaches to staging chronic liver diseases have limited utility for predicting liver cancer risk. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the cellular microenvironment of healthy and pre-malignant livers using two distinct mouse models. Downstream analyses unraveled a previously uncharacterized disease-associated hepatocyte (daHep) transcriptional state. These cells were absent in healthy livers but increasingly prevalent as chronic liver disease progressed. Copy number variation (CNV) analysis of microdissected tissue demonstrated that daHep-enriched regions are riddled with structural variants, suggesting these cells represent a pre-malignant intermediary. Integrated analysis of three recent human snRNA-seq datasets confirmed the presence of a similar phenotype in human chronic liver disease and further supported its enhanced mutational burden. Importantly, we show that high daHep levels precede carcinogenesis and predict a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development. These findings may change the way chronic liver disease patients are staged, surveilled, and risk stratified.

Abstract: The mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (PTP) can be defined as a Ca2+ activated mega-channel involved in mitochondrial damage and cell death, making its inhibition a hallmark for therapeutic purposes in many PTP-related paradigms. Although long-lasting PTP openings have been widely studied, the physiological implications of transient openings (also called “flickering” behavior) are still poorly understood. The flickering activity was suggested to play a role in the regulation of Ca2+ and ROS homeostasis, and yet this hypothesis did not reach general consensus. This state of affairs might arise from the lack of unquestionable experimental evidence, due to limitations of the available techniques for capturing transient PTP activity and to a still partial understanding of its molecular identity. In this review we will focus on possible implications of the PTP in physiology, in particular its role as a Ca2+ release pathway, discussing the consequences of its forced inhibition. We will also consider the recent hypothesis of the existence of more permeability pathways and their potential involvement in mitochondrial physiology.

Abstract: Summary
A successful HIV-1 cure strategy may require enhancing HIV-1 latency to silence HIV-1 transcription. Modulators of gene expression show promise as latency-promoting agents in vitro and in vivo. Here, we identify Su(var)3-9, enhancer-of-zeste, and trithorax (SET) and myeloid, Nervy, and DEAF-1 (MYND) domain-containing protein 5 (SMYD5) as a host factor required for HIV-1 transcription. SMYD5 is expressed in CD4+ T cells and activates the HIV-1 promoter with or without the viral Tat protein, while knockdown of SMYD5 decreases HIV-1 transcription in cell lines and primary T cells. SMYD5 associates in vivo with the HIV-1 promoter and binds the HIV trans-activation response (TAR) element RNA and Tat. Tat is methylated by SMYD5 in vitro, and in cells expressing Tat, SMYD5 protein levels are increased. The latter requires expression of the Tat cofactor and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 11 (USP11). We propose that SMYD5 is a host activator of HIV-1 transcription stabilized by Tat and USP11 and, together with USP11, a possible target for latency-promoting therapy.

Abstract: Root hairs are cells from the root epidermis that grow as long tubular bulges perpendicular to the root. They can grow in a variety of mechanical or chemical environments. Their mechanical properties are mainly due to their stiff cell wall which also constitutes a physical barrier between the cell and its environment. Thus, it is essential to be able to quantify the cell wall mechanical properties and their adaptation to environmental cues. Here, we present a technique we developed to measure the Young’s (elastic) modulus of the root hair cell wall. In essence, using custom-made glass microplates as cantilevers of calibrated stiffness, we are able to measure the force necessary to bend a single living root hair. From these experiments one can determine the stiffness and Young’s modulus of the root hair cell wall.

Abstract: Summary
Interstitial fluid (IF) accumulation between embryonic cells is thought to be important for embryo patterning and morphogenesis. Here, we identify a positive mechanical feedback loop between cell migration and IF relocalization and find that it promotes embryonic axis formation during zebrafish gastrulation. We show that anterior axial mesendoderm (prechordal plate [ppl]) cells, moving in between the yolk cell and deep cell tissue to extend the embryonic axis, compress the overlying deep cell layer, thereby causing IF to flow from the deep cell layer to the boundary between the yolk cell and the deep cell layer, directly ahead of the advancing ppl. This IF relocalization, in turn, facilitates ppl cell protrusion formation and migration by opening up the space into which the ppl moves and, thereby, the ability of the ppl to trigger IF relocalization by pushing against the overlying deep cell layer. Thus, embryonic axis formation relies on a hydraulic feedback loop between cell migration and IF relocalization.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of muscle mass is a common manifestation of chronic disease. We find the canonical Wnt pathway to be activated in mesenchymal progenitors (MPs) from cancer-induced cachectic mouse muscle. Next, we induce β-catenin transcriptional activity in murine MPs. As a result, we observe expansion of MPs in the absence of tissue damage, as well as rapid loss of muscle mass. Because MPs are present throughout the organism, we use spatially restricted CRE activation and show that the induction of tissue-resident MP activation is sufficient to induce muscle atrophy. We further identify increased expression of stromal NOGGIN and ACTIVIN-A as key drivers of atrophic processes in myofibers, and we verify their expression by MPs in cachectic muscle. Finally, we show that blocking ACTIVIN-A rescues the mass loss phenotype triggered by β-catenin activation in MPs, confirming its key functional role and strengthening the rationale for targeting this pathway in chronic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) reside within cilia of mammalian cells and must undergo regulated exit from cilia for the appropriate transduction of signals such as hedgehog morphogens. Lysine 63-linked ubiquitin (UbK63) chains mark GPCRs for regulated removal from cilia, but the molecular basis of UbK63 recognition inside cilia remains elusive. Here, we show that the BBSome—the trafficking complex in charge of retrieving GPCRs from cilia—engages the ancestral endosomal sorting factor target of Myb1-like 2 (TOM1L2) to recognize UbK63 chains within cilia of human and mouse cells. TOM1L2 directly binds to UbK63 chains and the BBSome, and targeted disruption of the TOM1L2/BBSome interaction results in the accumulation of TOM1L2, ubiquitin, and the GPCRs SSTR3, Smoothened, and GPR161 inside cilia. Furthermore, the single-cell alga Chlamydomonas also requires its TOM1L2 ortholog in order to clear ubiquitinated proteins from cilia. We conclude that TOM1L2 broadly enables the retrieval of UbK63-tagged proteins by the ciliary trafficking machinery.

Abstract: This study aimed to exploring the pathophysiological mechanism of 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-DHC) in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis. 7α,25-DHC accelerated the proteoglycan loss in ex vivo organ-cultured articular cartilage explant. It was mediated by the decreasing extracellular matrix major components, including aggrecan and type II collagen, and the increasing expression and activation of degenerative enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and -13, in chondrocytes cultured with 7α,25-DHC. Furthermore, 7α,25-DHC promoted caspase-dependent chondrocyte death via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Moreover, 7α,25-DHC upregulated the expression of inflammatory factors, including inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, nitric oxide, and prostaglandin E2, via the production of reactive oxygen species via increase of oxidative stress in chondrocytes. In addition, 7α,25-DHC upregulated the expression of autophagy biomarkers, including beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 via the modulation of p53-Akt-mTOR axis in chondrocytes. The expression of CYP7B1, caspase-3, and beclin-1 was elevated in the degenerative articular cartilage of mouse knee joint with OA. Taken together, our findings suggest that 7α,25-DHC is a pathophysiological risk factor of OA pathogenesis that is mediated a chondrocyte death via oxiapoptophagy, which is a mixed mode of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Enterocytes modulate the extent of postprandial lipemia by storing dietary fats in cytoplasmic lipid droplets (cLDs). We have previously shown that the integrin ligand MFGE8 links absorption of dietary fats with activation of triglyceride (TG) hydrolases that catabolize cLDs for chylomicron production. Here, we identify CES1D as the key hydrolase downstream of the MFGE8-αvβ5 integrin pathway that regulates catabolism of diet-derived cLDs. Mfge8 knockout (KO) enterocytes have reduced CES1D transcript and protein levels and reduced protein levels of the transcription factor HNF4γ. Both Ces1d and Hnf4γ KO mice have decreased enterocyte TG hydrolase activity coupled with retention of TG in cLDs. Mechanistically, MFGE8-dependent fatty acid uptake through CD36 stabilizes HNF4γ protein level; HNF4γ then increases Ces1d transcription. Our work identifies a regulatory network that regulates the severity of postprandial lipemia by linking dietary fat absorption with protein stabilization of a transcription factor that increases expression of hydrolases responsible for catabolizing diet-derived cLDs.

Abstract: Summary
Variants at the GBA locus, encoding glucocerebrosidase, are the strongest common genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD). To understand GBA-related disease mechanisms, we use a multi-part-enrichment proteomics and post-translational modification (PTM) workflow, identifying large numbers of dysregulated proteins and PTMs in heterozygous GBA-N370S PD patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) dopamine neurons. Alterations in glycosylation status show disturbances in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, which concur with upstream perturbations in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in GBA-PD neurons. Several native and modified proteins encoded by PD-associated genes are dysregulated in GBA-PD neurons. Integrated pathway analysis reveals impaired neuritogenesis in GBA-PD neurons and identify tau as a key pathway mediator. Functional assays confirm neurite outgrowth deficits and identify impaired mitochondrial movement in GBA-PD neurons. Furthermore, pharmacological rescue of glucocerebrosidase activity in GBA-PD neurons improves the neurite outgrowth deficit. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of PTMomics to elucidate neurodegeneration-associated pathways and potential drug targets in complex disease models.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channel of cochlear hair cells is gated by the tip link, but the mechanisms that establish the exquisite force sensitivity of this MET channel are not known. Here, we show that the tetraspan lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) directly couples the tip link to the MET channel. Disruption of these interactions severely perturbs MET. Notably, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of LHFPL5 binds to an amphipathic helix in TMC1, a critical gating domain conserved between different MET channels. Mutations in the amphipathic helix of TMC1 or in the N-terminus of LHFPL5 that perturb interactions of LHFPL5 with the amphipathic helix affect channel responses to mechanical force. We conclude that LHFPL5 couples the tip link to the MET channel and that channel gating depends on a structural element in TMC1 that is evolutionarily conserved between MET channels. Overall, our findings support a tether model for transduction channel gating by the tip link.

Abstract: Summary
Light has been shown to relieve pain, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that low-intensity (200 lux) green light treatment exerts antinociceptive effects through a neural circuit from the visual cortex projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in mice. Specifically, viral tracing, in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, and fiber photometry recordings show that green light activated glutamatergic projections from the medial part of the secondary visual cortex (V2MGlu) to GABAergic neurons in the ACC, which drives inhibition of local glutamatergic neurons (V2MGlu→ACCGABA→Glu). Optogenetic or chemogenetic activation of the V2MGlu→ACCGABA→Glu circuit mimics green-light-induced antinociception in both neuropathic and inflammatory pain model mice. Artificial inhibition of ACC-projecting V2MGlu neurons abolishes the antinociception induced by green light. Taken together, our study shows the V2M-ACC circuit as a potential candidate mediating green-light-induced antinociceptive effects.

Abstract: Summary
Characterizing influences of DNA methylation (DNAm) on non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is important to understand the mechanisms of gene regulation and cancer outcome. In our study, we describe the results of ncRNA quantitative trait methylation sites (ncQTM) analyses on 8,545 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 763 samples from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and 516 samples from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) to identify the significant associations between DNAm sites and ncRNAs (miRNA, long non-coding RNA [lncRNA], small nuclear RNA [snRNA], small nucleolar RNA [snoRNA], and rRNA) across 32 cancer types. With more than 22 billion tests, we identify 302,764 cis-ncQTMs (6.28% of all tested) and 79,841,728 trans-ncQTMs (1.15% of all tested). Most DNAm sites (70.6% on average) are in trans association, while only 25.2% DNAm sites are in cis association. Further, we develop a subtype named ncmcluster based on cancer-specific ncRNAs thatis associated with tumor microenvironment, clinical outcome, and biological pathways. To comprehensively describe the ncQTM patterns, we developed a database named Pancan-ncQTM (http://bigdata.njmu.edu.cn/Pancan-ncQTM/).

Abstract: Summary
Synaptotagmin III (Syt3) is a Ca2+-dependent membrane-traffic protein that is highly concentrated in synaptic plasma membranes and affects synaptic plasticity by regulating post-synaptic receptor endocytosis. Here, we show that Syt3 is upregulated in the penumbra after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Knockdown of Syt3 protects against I/R injury, promotes recovery of motor function, and inhibits cognitive decline. Overexpression of Syt3 exerts the opposite effects. Mechanistically, I/R injury augments Syt3-GluA2 interactions, decreases GluA2 surface expression, and promotes the formation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs). Using a CP-AMPAR antagonist or dissociating the Syt3-GluA2 complex via TAT-GluA2-3Y peptide promotes recovery from neurological impairments and improves cognitive function. Furthermore, Syt3 knockout mice are resistant to cerebral ischemia because they show high-level expression of surface GluA2 and low-level expression of CP-AMPARs after I/R. Our results indicate that Syt3-GluA2 interactions, which regulate the formation of CP-AMPARs, may be a therapeutic target for ischemic insults.

Abstract: Summary
The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is not effectively neutralized by most antibodies elicited by two doses of mRNA vaccines, but a third dose increases anti-Omicron neutralizing antibodies. We reveal mechanisms underlying this observation by combining computational modeling with data from vaccinated humans. After the first dose, limited antigen availability in germinal centers (GCs) results in a response dominated by B cells that target immunodominant epitopes that are mutated in an Omicron-like variant. After the second dose, these memory cells expand and differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies that are thus ineffective for such variants. However, these pre-existing antigen-specific antibodies transport antigen efficiently to secondary GCs. They also partially mask immunodominant epitopes. Enhanced antigen availability and epitope masking in secondary GCs together result in generation of memory B cells that target subdominant epitopes that are less mutated in Omicron. The third dose expands these cells and boosts anti-variant neutralizing antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identify genomic loci associated with complex traits, but it remains a challenge to identify the genes affected by causal genetic variants in these loci. Attempts to solve this challenge are frustrated by a number of compounding problems. Here, we show how to combine solutions to these problems into a unified mathematical framework. From this synthesis, it becomes possible to compute the probability that each gene in the genome is affected by a causal variant, given a particular trait, without making assumptions about the relevant cell types or tissues. We validate each component of the framework individually and in combination. When applied to large GWASs of human disease, the resulting paradigm can rediscover the majority of well-known disease genes. Moreover, it establishes human genetics support for many genes previously implicated only by clinical or preclinical evidence, and it uncovers a plethora of novel disease genes with compelling biological rationale.

Abstract: Summary
The signals controlling marginal zone (MZ) and follicular (FO) B cell development remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that AKT orchestrates MZ B cell formation in mice and humans. Genetic models that increase AKT signaling in B cells or abolish its impact on FoxO transcription factors highlight the AKT-FoxO axis as an on-off switch for MZ B cell formation in mice. In humans, splenic immunoglobulin (Ig) D+CD27+ B cells, proposed as an MZ B cell equivalent, display higher AKT signaling than naive IgD+CD27− and memory IgD−CD27+ B cells and develop in an AKT-dependent manner from their precursors in vitro, underlining the conservation of this developmental pathway. Consistently, CD148 is identified as a receptor indicative of the level of AKT signaling in B cells, expressed at a higher level in MZ B cells than FO B cells in mice as well as humans.

Abstract: Background
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological malignancy. Damage specific DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1) functions in nucleotide-excision repair and has been reported to be involved in cancer development. In this study, we aimed to determine the expression levels of DDB1 and their association with the clinical outcomes of patients with ovarian cancer.
Methods
Tissue arrays were performed on 54 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) samples. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine DDB1 expression. DDB1 expression levels among different EOC subtypes were analysed via one-way analysis of variance using SPSS Statistics 19.0. Correlation between DDB1 expression and chemotherapy course/progression-free survival (PFS) of patients was determined via Kaplan–Meier survival analysis using GraphPad Prism 5. Moreover, knockdown of DDB1 in ovarian cancer cells ES2 and OVCAR3 was used to preliminarily validate the role of DDB1.
Results
DDB1 was detected in the cytoplasm, especially in the nucleus, of all subtypes of EOC. However, DDB1 expression levels were significantly different between clear cell carcinoma and low-grade serous carcinoma (P = 0.022) and clear cell carcinoma and endometrioid cancer (P = 0.016). In addition, DDB1 expression was not significantly correlated with chemotherapy course (P = 0.433) or PFS (P = 0.566). High expression levels of DDB1 were correlated with significantly worse overall survival (P = 0.017) in patients with EOC. In addition, DDB1 knockdown in ovarian cancer cells decreased their proliferation in vitro.
Conclusion
Our results revealed that DDB1 expression is heterogeneous in ovarian cancer, suggesting its use as a potential biomarker for poor survival in ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-tumor efficacy of targeted therapies is variable across patients and cancer types. Even in patients with initial deep response, tumors are typically not eradicated and eventually relapse. To address these challenges, we present a systematic screen for targets that limit the anti-tumor efficacy of EGFR and ALK inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer and BRAF/MEK inhibitors in colorectal cancer. Our approach includes genome-wide CRISPR screens with or without drugs targeting the oncogenic driver (“anchor therapy”), and large-scale pairwise combination screens of anchor therapies with 351 other drugs. Interestingly, targeting of a small number of genes, including MCL1, BCL2L1, and YAP1, sensitizes multiple cell lines to the respective anchor therapy. Data from drug combination screens with EGF816 and ceritinib indicate that dasatinib and agents disrupting microtubules act synergistically across many cell lines. Finally, we show that a higher-order-combination screen with 26 selected drugs in two resistant EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines identified active triplet combinations.

Abstract: Summary
The expansion of introns within mammalian genomes poses a challenge for the production of full-length messenger RNAs (mRNAs), with increasing evidence that these long AT-rich sequences present obstacles to transcription. Here, we investigate RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation at high resolution in mammalian cells and demonstrate that RNAPII transcribes faster across introns. Moreover, we find that this acceleration requires the association of U1 snRNP (U1) with the elongation complex at 5′ splice sites. The role of U1 to stimulate elongation rate through introns reduces the frequency of both premature termination and transcriptional arrest, thereby dramatically increasing RNA production. We further show that changes in RNAPII elongation rate due to AT content and U1 binding explain previous reports of pausing or termination at splice junctions and the edge of CpG islands. We propose that U1-mediated acceleration of elongation has evolved to mitigate the risks that long AT-rich introns pose to transcript completion.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanosensitive processes often rely on adhesion structures to strengthen, or mature, in response to applied loads. However, a limited understanding of how the molecular tensions that are experienced by a particular protein affect the recruitment of other proteins represents a major obstacle in the way of deciphering molecular mechanisms that underlie mechanosensitive processes. Here, we describe an imaging-based technique, termed fluorescence-tension co-localization (FTC), for studying molecular-tension-sensitive protein recruitment inside cells. Guided by discrete time Markov chain simulations of protein recruitment, we integrate immunofluorescence labeling, molecular tension sensors, and machine learning to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and context dependence of molecular-tension-sensitive protein recruitment. The application of FTC to the mechanical linker protein vinculin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts reveals constitutive and context-specific molecular-tension-sensitive protein recruitment that varies with adhesion maturation. FTC overcomes limitations associated with the alteration of numerous proteins during the manipulation of cell contractility, providing molecularly specific insights into tension-sensitive protein recruitment.

Abstract: Summary
Caveolae have been linked to many biological functions, but their precise roles are unclear. Using quantitative whole-cell proteomics of genome-edited cells, we show that the oxidative stress response is the major pathway dysregulated in cells lacking the key caveola structural protein, CAVIN1. CAVIN1 deletion compromised sensitivity to oxidative stress in cultured cells and in animals. Wound-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were suppressed in Cavin1-null zebrafish, negatively affecting regeneration. Oxidative stress triggered lipid peroxidation and induced caveolar disassembly. The resulting release of CAVIN1 from caveolae allowed direct interaction between CAVIN1 and NRF2, a key regulator of the antioxidant response, facilitating NRF2 degradation. CAVIN1-null cells with impaired negative regulation of NRF2 showed resistance to lipid-peroxidation-induced ferroptosis. Thus, caveolae, via lipid peroxidation and CAVIN1 release, maintain cellular susceptibility to oxidative-stress-induced cell death, demonstrating a crucial role for this organelle in cellular homeostasis and wound response.

Abstract: Summary
The cGAS-STING pathway is central to the interferon response against DNA viruses. However, recent studies are increasingly demonstrating its role in the restriction of some RNA viruses. Here, we show that the cGAS-STING pathway also contributes to the interferon response against noroviruses, currently the commonest causes of infectious gastroenteritis worldwide. We show a significant reduction in interferon-β induction and a corresponding increase in viral replication in norovirus-infected cells after deletion of STING, cGAS, or IFI16. Further, we find that immunostimulatory host genome-derived DNA and mitochondrial DNA accumulate in the cytosol of norovirus-infected cells. Lastly, overexpression of the viral NS4 protein is sufficient to drive the accumulation of cytosolic DNA. Together, our data find a role for cGAS, IFI16, and STING in the restriction of noroviruses and show the utility of host genomic DNA as a damage-associated molecular pattern in cells infected with an RNA virus.

Abstract: Summary
The 2013 Ebola epidemic in Central and West Africa heralded the emergence of wide-spread, highly pathogenic viruses. The successful recombinant vector vaccine against Ebola (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP) will limit future outbreaks, but identifying mechanisms of protection is essential to protect the most vulnerable. Vaccine-induced antibodies are key determinants of vaccine efficacy, yet the mechanism by which vaccine-induced antibodies prevent Ebola infection remains elusive. Here, we exploit a break in long-term vaccine efficacy in non-human primates to identify predictors of protection. Using unbiased humoral profiling that captures neutralization and Fc-mediated functions, we find that antibodies specific for soluble glycoprotein (sGP) drive neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis and predict vaccine-mediated protection. Similarly, we show that protective sGP-specific monoclonal antibodies have elevated neutrophil-mediated phagocytic activity compared with non-protective antibodies, highlighting the importance of sGP in vaccine protection and monoclonal antibody therapeutics against Ebola virus.

Abstract: Summary
Mosaic symptoms are commonly observed in virus-infected plants. However, the underlying mechanism by which viruses cause mosaic symptoms as well as the key regulator(s) involved in this process remain unclear. Here, we investigate maize dwarf mosaic disease caused by sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). We find that the manifestation of mosaic symptoms in SCMV-infected maize plants requires light illumination and is correlated with mitochondrial reactive oxidative species (mROS) accumulation. The transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses results together with the genetic and cytopathological evidence indicate that malate and malate circulation pathways play essential roles in promoting mosaic symptom development. Specifically, at the pre-symptomatic infection stage or infection front, SCMV infection elevates the enzymatic activity of pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase by decreasing the phosphorylation of threonine527 under light, resulting in malate overproduction and subsequent mROS accumulation. Our findings indicate that activated malate circulation contributes to the manifestation of light-dependent mosaic symptoms via mROS.

Abstract: Summary
Although the skeleton is essential for locomotion, endocrine functions, and hematopoiesis, the molecular mechanisms of human skeletal development remain to be elucidated. Here, we introduce an integrative method to model human skeletal development by combining in vitro sclerotome induction from human pluripotent stem cells and in vivo endochondral bone formation by implanting the sclerotome beneath the renal capsules of immunodeficient mice. Histological and scRNA-seq analyses reveal that the induced bones recapitulate endochondral ossification and are composed of human skeletal cells and mouse circulatory cells. The skeletal cell types and their trajectories are similar to those of human embryos. Single-cell multiome analysis reveals dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility associated with multiple transcription factors constituting cell-type-specific gene-regulatory networks (GRNs). We further identify ZEB2, which may regulate the GRNs in human osteogenesis. Collectively, these results identify components of GRNs in human skeletal development and provide a valuable model for its investigation.

Abstract: Summary
Monoallelic inactivation of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in human cancer drives altered methylated genomic states, altered CTCF occupancy at promoter and enhancer regions, and deregulated global gene expression. In patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we find that acquired monoallelic CTCF-inactivating events drive subtle and local genomic effects in nearly half of t(5; 14) (q35; q32.2) rearranged patients, especially when CTCF-binding sites are preserved in between the BCL11B enhancer and the TLX3 oncogene. These solitary intervening sites insulate TLX3 from the enhancer by inducing competitive looping to multiple binding sites near the TLX3 promoter. Reduced CTCF levels or deletion of the intervening CTCF site abrogates enhancer insulation by weakening competitive looping while favoring TLX3 promoter to BCL11B enhancer looping, which elevates oncogene expression levels and leukemia burden.

Abstract: Summary
Microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is an intrinsically mutagenic pathway of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair essential for proliferation of homologous recombination (HR)-deficient tumors. Although targeting MMEJ has emerged as a powerful strategy to eliminate HR-deficient (HRD) cancers, this is limited by an incomplete understanding of the mechanism and factors required for MMEJ repair. Here, we identify the APE2 nuclease as an MMEJ effector. We show that loss of APE2 inhibits MMEJ at deprotected telomeres and at intra-chromosomal DSBs and is epistatic with Pol Theta for MMEJ activity. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that APE2 possesses intrinsic flap-cleaving activity, that its MMEJ function in cells depends on its nuclease activity, and further identify an uncharacterized domain required for its recruitment to DSBs. We conclude that this previously unappreciated role of APE2 in MMEJ contributes to the addiction of HRD cells to APE2, which could be exploited in the treatment of cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer genomes harbor a broad spectrum of structural variants (SVs) driving tumorigenesis, a relevant subset of which escape discovery using short-read sequencing. We employed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing in a paired diagnostic and post-therapy medulloblastoma to unravel the haplotype-resolved somatic genetic and epigenetic landscape. We assembled complex rearrangements, including a 1.55-Mbp chromothripsis event, and we uncover a complex SV pattern termed templated insertion (TI) thread, characterized by short (mostly <1 kb) insertions showing prevalent self-concatenation into highly amplified structures of up to 50 kbp in size. TI threads occur in 3% of cancers, with a prevalence up to 74% in liposarcoma, and frequent colocalization with chromothripsis. We also perform long-read-based methylome profiling and discover allele-specific methylation (ASM) effects, complex rearrangements exhibiting differential methylation, and differential promoter methylation in cancer-driver genes. Our study shows the advantage of long-read sequencing in the discovery and characterization of complex somatic rearrangements.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor p53 plays a pivotal role in tumor prevention. The activity of p53 is mainly restrained by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Mdm2. However, it is not well understood how the Mdm2-p53 pathway is intricately regulated. Here we report that the RNA binding protein RALY functions as an oncogenic factor in lung cancer. RALY simultaneously binds to Mdm2 and the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7. Via these interactions, RALY not only stabilizes Mdm2 by stimulating the deubiquitinating activity of USP7 toward Mdm2 but also increases the trans-E3 ligase activity of Mdm2 toward p53. Consequently, RALY enhances Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Functionally, RALY promotes lung tumorigenesis, at least partially, via negative regulation of p53. These findings suggest that RALY destabilizes p53 by modulating the function of Mdm2 at multiple levels. Our study also indicates a critical role for RALY in promoting lung tumorigenesis via p53 inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed DNA loss is a gene silencing mechanism that is employed by several vertebrate and nonvertebrate lineages, including all living jawless vertebrates and songbirds. Reconstructing the evolution of somatically eliminated (germline-specific) sequences in these species has proven challenging due to a high content of repeats and gene duplications in eliminated sequences and a corresponding lack of highly accurate and contiguous assemblies for these regions. Here, we present an improved assembly of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) genome that was generated using recently standardized methods that increase the contiguity and accuracy of vertebrate genome assemblies. This assembly resolves highly contiguous, somatically retained chromosomes and at least one germline-specific chromosome, permitting new analyses that reconstruct the timing, mode, and repercussions of recruitment of genes to the germline-specific fraction. These analyses reveal major roles of interchromosomal segmental duplication, intrachromosomal duplication, and positive selection for germline functions in the long-term evolution of germline-specific chromosomes.

Abstract: Summary
ATG5 is a part of the E3 ligase directing lipidation of ATG8 proteins, a process central to membrane atg8ylation and canonical autophagy. Loss of Atg5 in myeloid cells causes early mortality in murine models of tuberculosis. This in vivo phenotype is specific to ATG5. Here, we show using human cell lines that absence of ATG5, but not of other ATGs directing canonical autophagy, promotes lysosomal exocytosis and secretion of extracellular vesicles and, in murine Atg5fl/fl LysM-Cre neutrophils, their excessive degranulation. This is due to lysosomal disrepair in ATG5 knockout cells and the sequestration by an alternative conjugation complex, ATG12-ATG3, of ESCRT protein ALIX, which acts in membrane repair and exosome secretion. These findings reveal a previously undescribed function of ATG5 in its host-protective role in murine experimental models of tuberculosis and emphasize the significance of the branching aspects of the atg8ylation conjugation cascade beyond the canonical autophagy.

Abstract: SRSF3 (SRp20) is the smallest member of the serine/arginine (SR)-rich protein family. We found the annotated human SRSF3 and mouse Srsf3 RefSeq sequences are much larger than the detected SRSF3/Srsf3 RNA size by Northern blot. Mapping of RNA-seq reads from various human and mouse cell lines to the annotated SRSF3/Srsf3 gene illustrated only a partial coverage of its terminal exon 7. By 5ʹ RACE and 3ʹ RACE, we determined that SRSF3 gene spanning over 8422 bases and Srsf3 gene spanning over 9423 bases. SRSF3/Srsf3 gene has seven exons with exon 7 bearing two alternative polyadenylation signals (PAS). Through alternative PAS selection and exon 4 exclusion/inclusion by alternative RNA splicing, SRSF3/Srsf3 gene expresses four RNA isoforms. The major SRSF3 mRNA isoform with exon 4 exclusion by using a favorable distal PAS to encode a full-length protein is 1411 nt long (not annotated 4228 nt) and the same major mouse Srsf3 mRNA isoform is only 1295 nt (not annotated 2585 nt). The difference from the redefined RNA size of SRSF3/Srsf3 to the corresponding RefSeq sequence is at the 3’ UTR region. Collectively, the redefined SRSF3/Srsf3 gene structure and expression will allow better understanding of SRSF3 functions and its regulations in health and diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Sox2 expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) depends on a distal cluster of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), but their individual contributions and degree of interdependence remain a mystery. We analyzed the endogenous Sox2 locus using Big-IN to scarlessly integrate large DNA payloads incorporating deletions, rearrangements, and inversions affecting single or multiple DHSs, as well as surgical alterations to transcription factor (TF) recognition sequences. Multiple mESC clones were derived for each payload, sequence-verified, and analyzed for Sox2 expression. We found that two DHSs comprising a handful of key TF recognition sequences were each sufficient for long-range activation of Sox2 expression. By contrast, three nearby DHSs were entirely context dependent, showing no activity alone but dramatically augmenting the activity of the autonomous DHSs. Our results highlight the role of context in modulating genomic regulatory element function, and our synthetic regulatory genomics approach provides a roadmap for the dissection of other genomic loci.

Abstract: The single cell layer of surface ectoderm (SE) which overlies the closing neural tube (NT) plays a crucial biomechanical role during mammalian NT closure (NTC), challenging previous assumptions that it is only passive to the force-generating neuroepithelium (NE). Failure of NTC leads to congenital malformations known as NT defects (NTDs), including spina bifida (SB) and anencephaly in the spine and brain respectively. In several mouse NTD models, SB is caused by misexpression of SE-specific genes and is associated with disrupted SE mechanics, including loss of rostrocaudal cell elongation believed to be important for successful closure. In this study, we asked how SE mechanics affect NT morphology, and whether the characteristic rostrocaudal cell elongation at the progressing closure site is a response to tension anisotropy in the SE. We show that blocking SE-specific E-cadherin in ex utero mouse embryo culture influences NT morphology, as well as the F-actin cable. Cell border ablation shows that cell shape is not due to tension anisotropy, but that there are regional differences in SE tension. We also find that YAP nuclear translocation reflects regional tension heterogeneity, and that its expression is sensitive to pharmacological reduction of tension. In conclusion, our results confirm that the SE is a biomechanically important tissue for spinal NT morphogenesis and suggest a possible role of spatial regulation of cellular tension which could regulate downstream gene expression via mechanically-sensitive YAP activity.

Abstract: Introduction
Recent investigations suggest the potential negative impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women and pregnancy outcome. In addition, some studies have described pathological changes in the placental tissue of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers, which are related or not to the infection severity and/or infection trimester. Among the various molecules involved in the normal structure and functionality of the placenta, sialic acids (Sias) seem to play an important role. Hence, we aimed to investigate possible changes in the distribution and content of Sias with different glycosidic linkages, namely α2,3 and α2,6 Galactose- or N-acetyl-Galactosamine-linked Sias and polymeric Sia (PolySia), in placentas from pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the three different pregnancy trimesters.
Methods
α2,3 and α2,6 Galactose-linked Sias were evaluated by lectin histochemistry (Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), respectively), while immunohistochemistry was used for PolySia detection.
Results
Data showed lower levels of α2,3 Galactose-linked Sias in the trophoblast and underlying basement membrane/basal plasma membrane in placentas from women infected during the second and third infection trimester compared with uninfected cases and those infected during first trimester. On the other hand, higher levels of PolySia were detected in the trophoblast during the second and third infection trimester.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that changes in the sialylation status of trophoblast and its basement membrane/basal plasma membrane, together with other concomitant factors, could be at the basis of the most common placental histopathological alterations and gestational complications found especially in pregnancies with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second and third trimester.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy for which several epigenetic regulators have been identified as therapeutic targets. Here we report the development of cereblon-dependent degraders of IKZF2 and casein kinase 1α (CK1α), termed DEG-35 and DEG-77. We utilized a structure-guided approach to develop DEG-35 as a nanomolar degrader of IKZF2, a hematopoietic-specific transcription factor that contributes to myeloid leukemogenesis. DEG-35 possesses additional substrate specificity for the therapeutically relevant target CK1α, which was identified through unbiased proteomics and a PRISM screen assay. Degradation of IKZF2 and CK1α blocks cell growth and induces myeloid differentiation in AML cells through CK1α-p53- and IKZF2-dependent pathways. Target degradation by DEG-35 or a more soluble analog, DEG-77, delays leukemia progression in murine and human AML mouse models. Overall, we provide a strategy for multitargeted degradation of IKZF2 and CK1α to enhance efficacy against AML that may be expanded to additional targets and indications.

Abstract: Mitochondrial Ca2+ (mitCa2+) uptake controls both intraorganellar and cytosolic functions. Within the organelle, [Ca2+] increases regulate the activity of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, thus sustaining oxidative metabolism and ATP production. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also generated as side products of oxygen consumption. At the same time, mitochondria act as buffers of cytosolic Ca2+ (cytCa2+) increases, thus regulating Ca2+-dependent cellular processes. In pathological conditions, mitCa2+ overload triggers the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and the release of apoptotic cofactors. MitCa2+ uptake occurs in response of local [Ca2+] increases in sites of proximity between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria and is mediated by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), a highly selective channel of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Both channel and regulatory subunits form the MCU complex (MCUC). Cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and crystal structures revealed the correct assembly of MCUC and the function of critical residues for the regulation of Ca2+ conductance.

Abstract: Summary
The use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) as models for development and human disease has enabled the study of otherwise inaccessible tissues. A remaining challenge in developing reliable models is our limited understanding of the factors driving irregular differentiation of iPSCs, particularly the impact of acquired somatic mutations. We leveraged data from a pooled dopaminergic neuron differentiation experiment of 238 iPSC lines profiled with single-cell RNA and whole-exome sequencing to study how somatic mutations affect differentiation outcomes. We found that deleterious somatic mutations in key developmental genes, notably the BCOR gene, are strongly associated with failure in dopaminergic neuron differentiation and a larger proliferation rate in culture. We further identified broad differences in cell type composition between incorrectly and successfully differentiating lines, as well as significant changes in gene expression contributing to the inhibition of neurogenesis. Our work calls for caution in interpreting differentiation-related phenotypes in disease-modeling experiments.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are cytotoxic genome lesions that must be accurately and efficiently repaired to ensure genome integrity. In yeast, the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex nicks 5′-terminated DSB ends to initiate nucleolytic processing of DSBs for repair by homologous recombination. How MRX-DNA interactions support 5′ strand-specific nicking and how nicking is influenced by the chromatin context have remained elusive. Using a deep sequencing-based assay, we mapped MRX nicks at single-nucleotide resolution next to multiple DSBs in the yeast genome. We observed that the DNA end-binding Ku70-Ku80 complex directed DSB-proximal nicks and that repetitive MRX cleavage extended the length of resection tracts. We identified a sequence motif and a DNA meltability profile that is preferentially nicked by MRX. Furthermore, we found that nucleosomes as well as transcription impeded MRX incisions. Our findings suggest that local DNA sequence and chromatin features shape the activity of this central DSB repair complex.

Abstract: Summary
ER-phagy is a form of autophagy that is mediated by ER-phagy receptors and selectively degrades endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Coronaviruses have been shown to use the ER as a membrane source to establish their double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). However, whether viruses modulate ER-phagy to drive viral DMV formation and its underlying molecular mechanisms remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that coronavirus subverts ER-phagy by hijacking the ER-phagy receptors FAM134B and ATL3 into p62 condensates, resulting in increased viral replication. Mechanistically, we show that viral protein ORF8 binds to and undergoes condensation with p62. FAM134B and ATL3 interact with homodimer of ORF8 and are aggregated into ORF8/p62 liquid droplets, leading to ER-phagy inhibition. ORF8/p62 condensates disrupt ER-phagy to facilitate viral DMV formation and activate ER stress. Together, our data highlight how coronavirus modulates ER-phagy to drive viral replication by hijacking ER-phagy receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Abundant donor cytotoxic T cells that attack normal host organs remain a major problem for patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Despite an increase in our knowledge of the pathobiology of acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD), the mechanisms regulating the proliferation and function of donor T cells remain unclear. Here, we show that activated donor T cells express galectin-3 (Gal-3) after allo-HCT. In both major and minor histocompatibility-mismatched models of murine aGvHD, expression of Gal-3 is associated with decreased T cell activation and suppression of the secretion of effector cytokines, including IFN-γ and GM-CSF. Mechanistically, Gal-3 results in activation of NFAT signaling, which can induce T cell exhaustion. Gal-3 overexpression in human T cells prevents severe disease by suppressing cytotoxic T cells in xenogeneic aGvHD models. Together, these data identify the Gal-3-dependent regulatory pathway in donor T cells as a critical component of inflammation in aGvHD.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification controls cell fate determination. Here, we show that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1), a pivotal m6A “reader” protein, promotes the transdifferentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) into neural stem cell-like cells by activating the IκB-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-CCND1 axis. The inhibition of IκBα/β mRNA translation mediated by YTHDF1 LLPS is the key to the activation of the IκB-NF-κB-CCND1 axis. Disrupting either YTHDF1 LLPS or NF-κB activation inhibits transdifferentiation efficiency. Moreover, overexpression of the YTH domain of YTHDF1 inhibits the activation of the IκB-NF-κB-CCND1 axis by promoting IκBα/β mRNA translation. Overexpression of the tau-YTH fusion protein reactivates IκB-NF-κB-CCND1 axis by inhibiting the translation of IκBα/β mRNAs, and tau LLPS is observed, which can restore transdifferentiation efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that the protein-RNA LLPS plays essential roles in cell fate transition and provide insights into translational medicine and the therapy of neurological diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The human endometrium shows a remarkable regenerative capacity that enables cyclical regeneration and remodeling throughout a woman’s reproductive life. Although early postnatal uterine developmental cues direct this regeneration, the vital factors that govern early endometrial programming are largely unknown. We report that Beclin-1, an essential autophagy-associated protein, plays an integral role in uterine morphogenesis during the early postnatal period. We show that conditional depletion of Beclin-1 in the uterus triggers apoptosis and causes progressive loss of Lgr5+/Aldh1a1+ endometrial progenitor stem cells, with concomitant loss of Wnt signaling, which is crucial for stem cell renewal and epithelial gland development. Beclin-1 knockin (Becn1 KI) mice with disabled apoptosis exhibit normal uterine development. Importantly, the restoration of Beclin-1-driven autophagy, but not apoptosis, promotes normal uterine adenogenesis and morphogenesis. Together, the data suggest that Beclin-1-mediated autophagy acts as a molecular switch that governs the early uterine morphogenetic program by maintaining the endometrial progenitor stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Waning immunity and emerging variants necessitate continued vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Improvements in vaccine safety, tolerability, and ease of manufacturing would benefit these efforts. Here, we develop a potent and easily manufactured nanoparticle vaccine displaying the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). Computational design to stabilize the RBD, eliminate glycosylation, and focus the immune response to neutralizing epitopes results in an RBD immunogen that resolves issues hindering the efficient nanoparticle display of the native RBD. This non-glycosylated RBD can be genetically fused to diverse single-component nanoparticle platforms, maximizing manufacturing ease and flexibility. All engineered RBD nanoparticles elicit potently neutralizing antibodies in mice that far exceed monomeric RBDs. A 60-copy particle (noNAG-RBD-E2p) also elicits potently neutralizing antibodies in non-human primates. The neutralizing antibody titers elicited by noNAG-RBD-E2p are comparable to a benchmark stabilized spike antigen and reach levels against Omicron BA.5 that suggest that it would provide protection against emerging variants.

Abstract: Summary
The permeability barrier present in the oral cavity is critical for protection from infection. Although lipids have properties suitable for permeability barrier formation, little is known about their role in oral barrier formation. Here, we show the presence of ω-O-acylceramides (acylceramides) and protein-bound ceramides, which are essential for the formation of permeability barriers in the epidermis, in the oral mucosae (buccal and tongue mucosae), esophagus, and stomach in mice. Conditional knockout of the fatty acid elongase Elovl1, which is involved in the synthesis of ≥C24 ceramides including acylceramides and protein-bound ceramides, in the oral mucosae and esophagus causes increased pigment penetration into the mucosal epithelium of the tongue and enhanced aversive responses to capsaicin-containing water. We find acylceramides in the buccal and gingival mucosae and protein-bound ceramides in the gingival mucosa in humans. These results indicate that acylceramides and protein-bound ceramides are important for oral permeability barrier formation.

Abstract: Summary
Much progress has been made toward generating analogs of early embryos, such as gastruloids and embryoids, in vitro. However, methods for how to fully mimic the cell movements of gastrulation and coordinate germ-layer patterning to induce head formation are still lacking. Here, we show that a regional Nodal gradient applied to zebrafish animal pole explant can generate a structure that recapitulates the key cell movements of gastrulation. Using single-cell transcriptome and in situ hybridization analysis, we assess the dynamics of the cell fates and patterning of this structure. The mesendoderm differentiates into the anterior endoderm, prechordal plate, notochord, and tailbud-like cells along an anterior-posterior axis, and an anterior-posterior-patterned head-like structure (HLS) progressively forms during late gastrulation. Among 105 immediate Nodal targets, 14 genes contain axis-induction ability, and 5 of them induce a complete or partial head structure when overexpressed in the ventral side of zebrafish embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Body temperature in homeothermic animals does not remain constant but displays a regular circadian fluctuation within a physiological range (e.g., 35°C–38.5°C in mice), constituting a fundamental systemic signal to harmonize circadian clock-regulated physiology. Here, we find the minimal upstream open reading frame (uORF) encoded by the 5′ UTR of the mammalian core clock gene Per2 and reveal its role as a regulatory module for temperature-dependent circadian clock entrainment. A temperature shift within the physiological range does not affect transcription but instead increases translation of Per2 through its minimal uORF. Genetic ablation of the Per2 minimal uORF and inhibition of phosphoinositide-3-kinase, lying upstream of temperature-dependent Per2 protein synthesis, perturb the entrainment of cells to simulated body temperature cycles. At the organismal level, Per2 minimal uORF mutant skin shows delayed wound healing, indicating that uORF-mediated Per2 modulation is crucial for optimal tissue homeostasis. Combined with transcriptional regulation, Per2 minimal uORF-mediated translation may enhance the fitness of circadian physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor, either by mutations or through hyperactivation of repressors such as MDM2 and MDM4, is a hallmark of cancer. Although many inhibitors of the p53-MDM2/4 interaction have been developed, such as Nutlin, their therapeutic value is limited by highly heterogeneous cellular responses. We report here a multi-omics investigation of the cellular response to MDM2/4 inhibitors, leading to identification of FAM193A as a widespread regulator of p53 function. CRISPR screening identified FAM193A as necessary for the response to Nutlin. FAM193A expression correlates with Nutlin sensitivity across hundreds of cell lines. Furthermore, genetic codependency data highlight FAM193A as a component of the p53 pathway across diverse tumor types. Mechanistically, FAM193A interacts with MDM4, and FAM193A depletion stabilizes MDM4 and inhibits the p53 transcriptional program. Last, FAM193A expression is associated with better prognosis in multiple malignancies. Altogether, these results identify FAM193A as a positive regulator of p53.

Abstract: Summary
Much of systems neuroscience posits the functional importance of brain activity patterns that lack natural scales of sizes, durations, or frequencies. The field has developed prominent, and sometimes competing, explanations for the nature of this scale-free activity. Here, we reconcile these explanations across species and modalities. First, we link estimates of excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance with time-resolved correlation of distributed brain activity. Second, we develop an unbiased method for sampling time series constrained by this time-resolved correlation. Third, we use this method to show that estimates of E-I balance account for diverse scale-free phenomena without need to attribute additional function or importance to these phenomena. Collectively, our results simplify existing explanations of scale-free brain activity and provide stringent tests on future theories that seek to transcend these explanations.

Abstract: Glycolysis is one of the factors influencing cancer cell growth and metastasis. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of SETD8 gene, which is a pro-oncogene. Using bioinformatics tools including Ualcan, Timer, GEPIA, and PrognoScan to study the expression of SETD8 in colorectal cancer, we found that SETD8 expression was higher in colon cancer tissues than that in normal tissues. Higher levels of SETD8 predicted poorer survival of patients. This piqued our interest, so we transfected SETD8 knockdown and overexpression plasmids into colorectal cancer cells and found that SETD8 overexpression enhanced proliferation and glycolysis in colon cancer cells, while SETD8 knockdown decreased cell proliferation and glycolysis. Mechanistically, we examined the expression of HIF1α and HK2 protein by western-blot assay and found that SETD8 activated the HIF1α/HK2 pathway. Then, we treated SETD8-overexpressed cells with HIF1α inhibitor and found that the pro-tumor growth and glycolytic effects of SETD8 were reversed, indicating that SETD8 promoted the growths of colorectal cancer cells by upregulating the HIF1α /HK2 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
p53 and HSF1 are two major transcription factors involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, whose dysregulation contributes to cancer and neurodegeneration. Contrary to most cancers, p53 is increased in Huntington’s disease (HD) and other neurodegenerative diseases, while HSF1 is decreased. p53 and HSF1 reciprocal regulation has been shown in different contexts, but their connection in neurodegeneration remains understudied. Using cellular and animal models of HD, we show that mutant HTT stabilized p53 by abrogating the interaction between p53 and E3 ligase MDM2. Stabilized p53 promotes protein kinase CK2 alpha prime and E3 ligase FBXW7 transcription, both of which are responsible for HSF1 degradation. Consequently, p53 deletion in striatal neurons of zQ175 HD mice restores HSF1 abundance and decrease HTT aggregation and striatal pathology. Our work shows the mechanism connecting p53 stabilization with HSF1 degradation and pathophysiology in HD and sheds light on the broader molecular differences and commonalities between cancer and neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Oxygen is toxic across all three domains of life. Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we systematically investigate the major cellular pathways affected by excess molecular oxygen. We find that hyperoxia destabilizes a specific subset of Fe-S cluster (ISC)-containing proteins, resulting in impaired diphthamide synthesis, purine metabolism, nucleotide excision repair, and electron transport chain (ETC) function. Our findings translate to primary human lung cells and a mouse model of pulmonary oxygen toxicity. We demonstrate that the ETC is the most vulnerable to damage, resulting in decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption. This leads to further tissue hyperoxia and cyclic damage of the additional ISC-containing pathways. In support of this model, primary ETC dysfunction in the Ndufs4 KO mouse model causes lung tissue hyperoxia and dramatically increases sensitivity to hyperoxia-mediated ISC damage. This work has important implications for hyperoxia pathologies, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, ischemia-reperfusion injury, aging, and mitochondrial disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) will enable advances in cancer immunotherapy. Understanding how CARs affect T cell differentiation from PSCs is important for this effort. The recently described artificial thymic organoid (ATO) system supports in vitro differentiation of PSCs to T cells. Unexpectedly, PSCs transduced with a CD19-targeted CAR resulted in diversion of T cell differentiation to the innate lymphoid cell 2 (ILC2) lineage in ATOs. T cells and ILC2s are closely related lymphoid lineages with shared developmental and transcriptional programs. Mechanistically, we show that antigen-independent CAR signaling during lymphoid development enriched for ILC2-primed precursors at the expense of T cell precursors. We applied this understanding to modulate CAR signaling strength through expression level, structure, and presentation of cognate antigen to demonstrate that the T cell-versus-ILC lineage decision can be rationally controlled in either direction, providing a framework for achieving CAR-T cell development from PSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular organelles of mammalian cells communicate with one another during various cellular processes. The functions and molecular mechanisms of such interorganelle association remain largely unclear, however. We here identify voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2), a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, as a binding partner of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a regulator of clathrin-independent endocytosis downstream of the small GTPase Ras. VDAC2 tethers endosomes positive for the Ras-PI3K complex to mitochondria in response to cell stimulation with epidermal growth factor and promotes clathrin-independent endocytosis, as well as endosome maturation at membrane association sites. With an optogenetics system to induce mitochondrion-endosome association, we find that, in addition to its structural role in such association, VDAC2 is functionally implicated in the promotion of endosome maturation. The mitochondrion-endosome association thus plays a role in the regulation of clathrin-independent endocytosis and endosome maturation.

Abstract: Summary
The clonal selection theory describes key features of adaptive immune responses of B and T cells. For αβ T cells and B cells, antigen recognition and selection principles are known at a detailed molecular level. The precise role of the antigen receptor in γδ T cells remains less well understood. To better understand the role of the γδ T cell receptor (TCR), we generate an orthotopic TCRδ transgenic mouse model. We demonstrate a multi-layered functionality of γδ TCRs and diverse roles of CDR3δ-mediated selection during γδ T cell development. Whereas epithelial populations using Vγ5 or Vγ7 chains are almost unaffected in their biology in the presence of the transgenic TCRδ chain, pairing with Vγ1 positively selects γδ T cell subpopulations with distinct programs in several organs, thereby distorting the repertoire. In conclusion, our data support dictation of developmental tropism together with adaptive-like recognition principles in a single antigen receptor.

Abstract: Summary
The balance between cell proliferation and differentiation is essential for maintaining the neural progenitor pool and brain development. Although the mechanisms underlying cell proliferation and differentiation at the transcriptional level have been studied intensively, post-transcriptional regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation remains largely unclear. Here, we show that deletion of the alternative splicing regulator PQBP1 in striatal progenitors results in defective striatal development due to impaired neurogenesis of spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Pqbp1-deficient striatal progenitors exhibit declined proliferation and increased differentiation, resulting in a reduced striatal progenitor pool. We further reveal that PQBP1 associates with components in splicing machinery. The alternative splicing profiles identify that PQBP1 promotes the exon 9 inclusion of Numb, a variant that mediates progenitor proliferation. These findings identify PQBP1 as a regulator in balancing striatal progenitor proliferation and differentiation and provide alternative insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying Renpenning syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Development of therapies with the potential to change the allergic asthmatic disease course will require the discovery of targets that play a central role during the initiation of an allergic response, such as those involved in the process of allergen recognition. We use a receptor glycocapture technique to screen for house dust mite (HDM) receptors and identify LMAN1 as a candidate. We verify the ability of LMAN1 to directly bind HDM allergens and demonstrate that LMAN1 is expressed on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs) and airway epithelial cells (AECs) in vivo. Overexpression of LMAN1 downregulates NF-κB signaling in response to inflammatory cytokines or HDM. HDM promotes binding of LMAN1 to the FcRγ and recruitment of SHP1. Last, peripheral DCs of asthmatic individuals show a significant reduction in the expression of LMAN1 compared with healthy controls. These findings have potential implications for the development of therapeutic interventions for atopic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory responses are crucial for controlling infections and initiating tissue repair. However, excessive and uncontrolled inflammation causes inflammatory disease. Processing and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 depend on caspase-1 activation within inflammasomes. Assembly of inflammasomes is initiated upon activation of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), followed by sequential polymerization of pyrin domain (PYD)-containing and caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins mediated by homotypic PYD and CARD interactions. Small PYD- or CARD-only proteins (POPs and COPs, respectively) evolved in higher primates to target these crucial interactions to limit inflammation. Here, we show the ability of COPs to regulate inflammasome activation by modulating homotypic CARD-CARD interactions in vitro and in vivo. CARD16, CARD17, and CARD18 displace crucial CARD interactions between caspase-1 proteins through competitive binding and ameliorate uric acid crystal-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory disease. COPs therefore represent an important family of inflammasome regulators and ameliorate inflammatory disease.

Abstract: Summary
The clearance of untranslated mRNAs by Argonaute proteins is essential for embryonic development in metazoans. However, it is currently unknown whether similar processes exist in unicellular eukaryotes. The ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia harbors a vast array of PIWI-clade Argonautes involved in various small RNA (sRNA) pathways, many of which have not yet been investigated. Here, we investigate the function of a PIWI protein, Ptiwi08, whose expression is limited to a narrow time window during development, concomitant with the start of zygotic transcription. We show that Ptiwi08 acts in an endogenous small interfering RNA (endo-siRNA) pathway involved in the clearance of untranslated mRNAs. These endo-siRNAs are found in clusters that are strictly antisense to their target mRNAs and are a subset of siRNA-producing clusters (SRCs). Furthermore, the endo-siRNAs are 2′-O-methylated by Hen1 and require Dcr1 for their biogenesis. Our findings suggest that sRNA-mediated developmental mRNA clearance extends beyond metazoans and may be a more widespread mechanism than previously anticipated.

Abstract: Summary
Subunit vaccines typically require co-administration with an adjuvant to elicit protective immunity, adding development hurdles that can impede rapid pandemic responses. To circumvent the need for adjuvant in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subunit vaccine, we engineer a thermostable immunotargeting vaccine (ITV) that leverages the pan-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody 44H10 to deliver the viral spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to antigen-presenting cells. X-ray crystallography shows that 44H10 binds to a conserved epitope on HLA-DR, providing the basis for its broad HLA-DR reactivity. Adjuvant-free ITV immunization in rabbits and ferrets induces robust anti-RBD antibody responses that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and protect recipients from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. We demonstrate that the modular nature of the ITV scaffold with respect to helper T cell epitopes and diverse RBD antigens facilitates broad sarbecovirus neutralization. Our findings support anti-HLA-DR immunotargeting as an effective means to induce strong antibody responses to subunit antigens without requiring an adjuvant.

Abstract: Summary
Cell type is hypothesized to be a key determinant of a neuron’s role within a circuit. Here, we examine whether a neuron’s transcriptomic type influences the timing of its activity. We develop a deep-learning architecture that learns features of interevent intervals across timescales (ms to >30 min). We show that transcriptomic cell-class information is embedded in the timing of single neuron activity in the intact brain of behaving animals (calcium imaging and extracellular electrophysiology) as well as in a bio-realistic model of the visual cortex. Further, a subset of excitatory cell types are distinguishable but can be classified with higher accuracy when considering cortical layer and projection class. Finally, we show that computational fingerprints of cell types may be universalizable across structured stimuli and naturalistic movies. Our results indicate that transcriptomic class and type may be imprinted in the timing of single neuron activity across diverse stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including CTLA-4- and PD-1-blocking antibodies, can have profound effects on tumor immune cell infiltration that have not been consistent in biopsy series reported to date. Here, we analyze seven molecular datasets of samples from patients with advanced melanoma (N = 514) treated with ICI agents to investigate clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic features of anti-PD-1 response in cutaneous melanoma. We find that prior anti-CTLA-4 therapy is associated with differences in genomic, individual gene, and gene signatures in anti-PD-1 responders. Anti-CTLA-4-experienced melanoma tumors that respond to PD-1 blockade exhibit increased tumor mutational burden, inflammatory signatures, and altered cell cycle processes compared with anti-CTLA-4-naive tumors or anti-CTLA-4-experienced, anti-PD-1-nonresponsive melanoma tumors. We report a harmonized, aggregate resource and suggest that prior CTLA-4 blockade therapy is associated with marked differences in the tumor microenvironment that impact the predictive features of PD-1 blockade therapy response.

Abstract: Summary
STING is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein regulating innate immunity. After binding with cyclic guanosine monophosphate-AMP (cGAMP), STING translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus to stimulate TBK1 and IRF3 activation, leading to expression of type I interferon. However, the exact mechanism concerning STING activation remains largely enigmatic. Here, we identify tripartite motif 10 (TRIM10) as a positive regulator of STING signaling. TRIM10-deficient macrophages exhibit reduced type I interferon production upon double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or cGAMP stimulation and decreased resistance to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. Additionally, TRIM10-deficient mice are more susceptible to HSV-1 infection and exhibit faster melanoma growth. Mechanistically, TRIM10 associates with STING and catalyzes K27- and K29-linked polyubiquitination of STING at K289 and K370, which promotes STING trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, formation of STING aggregates, and recruitment of TBK1 to STING, ultimately enhancing the STING-dependent type I interferon response. Our study defines TRIM10 as a critical activator in cGAS-STING-mediated antiviral and antitumor immunity.
