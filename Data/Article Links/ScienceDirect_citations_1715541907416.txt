Abstract: Summary
Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) is the major protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in plasma. We have identified an endogenously expressed long noncoding natural antisense transcript, APOA1-AS, which acts as a negative transcriptional regulator of APOA1 both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of APOA1-AS in cultured cells resulted in the increased expression of APOA1 and two neighboring genes in the APO cluster. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses of a ∼50 kb chromatin region flanking the APOA1 gene demonstrated that APOA1-AS can modulate distinct histone methylation patterns that mark active and/or inactive gene expression through the recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes. Targeting APOA1-AS with short antisense oligonucleotides also enhanced APOA1 expression in both human and monkey liver cells and induced an increase in hepatic RNA and protein expression in African green monkeys. Furthermore, the results presented here highlight the significant local modulatory effects of long noncoding antisense RNAs and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of manipulating the expression of these transcripts both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Mice and humans with growth hormone receptor/IGF-1 deficiencies display major reductions in age-related diseases. Because protein restriction reduces GHR-IGF-1 activity, we examined links between protein intake and mortality. Respondents aged 50–65 reporting high protein intake had a 75% increase in overall mortality and a 4-fold increase in cancer death risk during the following 18 years. These associations were either abolished or attenuated if the proteins were plant derived. Conversely, high protein intake was associated with reduced cancer and overall mortality in respondents over 65, but a 5-fold increase in diabetes mortality across all ages. Mouse studies confirmed the effect of high protein intake and GHR-IGF-1 signaling on the incidence and progression of breast and melanoma tumors, but also the detrimental effects of a low protein diet in the very old. These results suggest that low protein intake during middle age followed by moderate to high protein consumption in old adults may optimize healthspan and longevity.

Abstract: Summary
One envisioned function of homologous recombination (HR) is to find a template for DNA synthesis from the resected 3′-OH molecules that occur during double-strand break (DSB) repair at collapsed replication forks. However, the interplay between DNA synthesis and HR remains poorly understood in higher eukaryotic cells. Here, we reveal functions for the breast cancer proteins BRCA2 and PALB2 at blocked replication forks and show a role for these proteins in stimulating polymerase η (Polη) to initiate DNA synthesis. PALB2, BRCA2, and Polη colocalize at stalled or collapsed replication forks after hydroxyurea treatment. Moreover, PALB2 and BRCA2 interact with Polη and are required to sustain the recruitment of Polη at blocked replication forks. PALB2 and BRCA2 stimulate Polη-dependent DNA synthesis on D loop substrates. We conclude that PALB2 and BRCA2, in addition to their functions in D loop formation, play crucial roles in the initiation of recombination-associated DNA synthesis by Polη-mediated DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is crucial for glucose homeostasis in mammalian cells. The current understanding of PDC regulation involves inhibitory serine phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by PDH kinase (PDK), whereas dephosphorylation of PDH by PDH phosphatase (PDP) activates PDC. Here, we report that lysine acetylation of PDHA1 and PDP1 is common in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cells and diverse human cancer cells. K321 acetylation inhibits PDHA1 by recruiting PDK1, and K202 acetylation inhibits PDP1 by dissociating its substrate PDHA1, both of which are important in promoting glycolysis in cancer cells and consequent tumor growth. Moreover, we identified mitochondrial ACAT1 and SIRT3 as the upstream acetyltransferase and deacetylase, respectively, of PDHA1 and PDP1, while knockdown of ACAT1 attenuates tumor growth. Furthermore, Y381 phosphorylation of PDP1 dissociates SIRT3 and recruits ACAT1 to PDC. Together, hierarchical, distinct posttranslational modifications act in concert to control molecular composition of PDC and contribute to the Warburg effect.

Abstract: Summary
L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (LTCC) couple neuronal excitation to gene transcription. LTCC activity is elevated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and depressed by the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN), and both enzymes are localized to the channel by A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP79/150). AKAP79/150 anchoring of CaN also promotes LTCC activation of transcription through dephosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). We report here that the basal activity of AKAP79/150-anchored PKA maintains neuronal LTCC coupling to CaN-NFAT signaling by preserving LTCC phosphorylation in opposition to anchored CaN. Genetic disruption of AKAP-PKA anchoring promoted redistribution of the kinase out of postsynaptic dendritic spines, profound decreases in LTCC phosphorylation and Ca2+ influx, and impaired NFAT movement to the nucleus and activation of transcription. Thus, LTCC-NFAT transcriptional signaling in neurons requires precise organization and balancing of PKA and CaN activities in the channel nanoenvironment, which is only made possible by AKAP79/150 scaffolding.

Abstract: Extracellular hypotonic stress can affect cellular function. Whether and how hypotonicity affects immune cell function remains to be elucidated. Macrophages are immune cells that play key roles in adaptive and innate in immune reactions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of hypotonic stress in the function of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Hypotonic stress increased endocytic activity in BMDMs, but there was no significant change in the expression of CD80, CD86, and MHC class II molecules, nor in the secretion of TNF-α or IL-10 by BMDMs. Furthermore, the enhanced endocytic activity of BMDMs triggered by hypotonic stress was significantly inhibited by chloride channel-3 (ClC-3) siRNA. Our findings suggest that hypotonic stress can induce endocytosis in BMDMs and that ClC-3 plays a central role in the endocytic process.

Abstract: Summary
Upon androgen stimulation, PKN1-mediated histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3T11P) promotes AR target gene activation. However, the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Here, we show that WDR5, a subunit of the SET1/MLL complex, interacts with H3T11P, and this interaction facilitates the recruitment of the MLL1 complex and subsequent H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3). Using ChIP-seq, we find that androgen stimulation results in a 6-fold increase in the number of H3T11P-marked regions and induces WDR5 colocalization to one third of H3T11P-enriched promoters, thus establishing a genome-wide relationship between H3T11P and recruitment of WDR5. Accordingly, PKN1 knockdown or chemical inhibition severely blocks WDR5 chromatin association and H3K4me3 on AR target genes. Finally, WDR5 is critical in prostate cancer cell proliferation and is hyperexpressed in human prostate cancers. Together, these results identify WDR5 as a critical epigenomic integrator of histone phosphorylation and methylation and as a major driver of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial calcium accumulation was recently shown to depend on a complex composed of an inner-membrane channel (MCU and MCUb) and regulatory subunits (MICU1, MCUR1, and EMRE). A fundamental property of MCU is low activity at resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, preventing deleterious Ca2+ cycling and organelle overload. Here we demonstrate that these properties are ensured by a regulatory heterodimer composed of two proteins with opposite effects, MICU1 and MICU2, which, both in purified lipid bilayers and in intact cells, stimulate and inhibit MCU activity, respectively. Both MICU1 and MICU2 are regulated by calcium through their EF-hand domains, thus accounting for the sigmoidal response of MCU to [Ca2+] in situ and allowing tight physiological control. At low [Ca2+], the dominant effect of MICU2 largely shuts down MCU activity; at higher [Ca2+], the stimulatory effect of MICU1 allows the prompt response of mitochondria to Ca2+ signals generated in the cytoplasm.

Abstract: Summary
Clonal evolution and intratumoral heterogeneity drive cancer progression through unknown molecular mechanisms. To address this issue, functional differences between single T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) clones were assessed using a zebrafish transgenic model. Functional variation was observed within individual clones, with a minority of clones enhancing growth rate and leukemia-propagating potential with time. Akt pathway activation was acquired in a subset of these evolved clones, which increased the number of leukemia-propagating cells through activating mTORC1, elevated growth rate likely by stabilizing the Myc protein, and rendered cells resistant to dexamethasone, which was reversed by combined treatment with an Akt inhibitor. Thus, T-ALL clones spontaneously and continuously evolve to drive leukemia progression even in the absence of therapy-induced selection.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of the autophagic vesicles requires the recruitment of ubiquitin-like Atg8 proteins to the membrane of nascent autophagosomes. Seven Atg8 homologs are present in mammals, split into the LC3 and the GABARAP/GATE-16 families, whose respective functions are unknown. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we investigated the functions of the GABARAP and the LC3 homologs, LGG-1 and LGG-2, in autophagosome biogenesis. Both LGG-1 and LGG-2 localize to the autophagosomes but display partially overlapping patterns. During allophagy, a developmentally stereotyped autophagic flux, LGG-1 acts upstream of LGG-2 to allow its localization to autophagosomes. LGG-2 controls the maturation of LGG-1-positive autophagosomes and facilitates the tethering with the lysosomes through a direct interaction with the VPS-39 HOPS complex subunit. Genetic analyses sustain a sequential implication of LGG-1, LGG-2, RAB-7, and HOPS complex to generate autolysosomes. The duplications of Atg8 in metazoans thus allowed the acquisition of specialized functions for autophagosome maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Centrosomes are important cell organizers. They consist of a pair of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM) that expands dramatically during mitosis—a process termed centrosome maturation. How centrosomes mature remains mysterious. Here, we identify a domain in Drosophila Cnn that appears to be phosphorylated by Polo/Plk1 specifically at centrosomes during mitosis. The phosphorylation promotes the assembly of a Cnn scaffold around the centrioles that is in constant flux, with Cnn molecules recruited continuously around the centrioles as the scaffold spreads slowly outward. Mutations that block Cnn phosphorylation strongly inhibit scaffold assembly and centrosome maturation, whereas phosphomimicking mutations allow Cnn to multimerize in vitro and to spontaneously form cytoplasmic scaffolds in vivo that organize microtubules independently of centrosomes. We conclude that Polo/Plk1 initiates the phosphorylation-dependent assembly of a Cnn scaffold around centrioles that is essential for efficient centrosome maturation in flies.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue fibrosis development blocks adipocyte hypertrophy and favors ectopic lipid accumulation. Here, we show that adipose tissue fibrosis is associated with obesity and insulin resistance in humans and mice. Kinetic studies in C3H mice fed a high-fat diet show activation of macrophages and progression of fibrosis along with adipocyte metabolic dysfunction and death. Adipose tissue fibrosis is attenuated by macrophage depletion. Impairment of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling protects mice from obesity-induced fibrosis. The presence of a functional Toll-like receptor 4 on adipose tissue hematopoietic cells is necessary for the initiation of adipose tissue fibrosis. Continuous low-dose infusion of the Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, lipopolysaccharide, promotes adipose tissue fibrosis. Ex vivo, lipopolysaccharide-mediated induction of fibrosis is prevented by antibodies against the profibrotic factor TGFβ1. Together, these results indicate that obesity and endotoxemia favor the development of adipose tissue fibrosis, a condition associated with insulin resistance, through immune cell Toll-like receptor 4.

Abstract: Summary
A small-molecule fluorescent probe specific for human pluripotent stem cells would serve as a useful tool for basic cell biology research and stem cell therapy. Screening of fluorescent chemical libraries with human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and subsequent evaluation of hit molecules identified a fluorescent compound (Kyoto probe 1 [KP-1]) that selectively labels human pluripotent stem cells. Our analyses indicated that the selectivity results primarily from a distinct expression pattern of ABC transporters in human pluripotent stem cells and from the transporter selectivity of KP-1. Expression of ABCB1 (MDR1) and ABCG2 (BCRP), both of which cause the efflux of KP-1, is repressed in human pluripotent stem cells. Although KP-1, like other pluripotent markers, is not absolutely specific for pluripotent stem cells, the identified chemical probe may be used in conjunction with other reagents.

Abstract: Summary
Anaphase-promoting complex Cdc20 (APCCdc20) plays pivotal roles in governing mitotic progression. By suppressing APCCdc20, antimitotic agents activate the spindle-assembly checkpoint and induce apoptosis after prolonged treatment, whereas depleting endogenous Cdc20 suppresses tumorigenesis in part by triggering mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying apoptosis induced by Cdc20 abrogation remains poorly understood. Here, we report the BH3-only proapoptotic protein Bim as an APCCdc20 target, such that depletion of Cdc20 sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli. Strikingly, Cdc20 and multiple APC-core components were identified in a small interfering RNA screen that, upon knockdown, sensitizes otherwise resistant cancer cells to chemoradiation in a Bim-dependent manner. Consistently, human adult T cell leukemia cells that acquire elevated APCCdc20 activity via expressing the Tax viral oncoprotein exhibit reduced Bim levels and resistance to anticancer agents. These results reveal an important role for APCCdc20 in governing apoptosis, strengthening the rationale for developing specific Cdc20 inhibitors as effective anticancer agents.

Abstract: Summary
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent disease, but 30%–40% of cases undergo histologic transformation to an aggressive malignancy, typically represented by diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The pathogenesis of this process remains largely unknown. Using whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis, we show here that the dominant clone of FL and transformed FL (tFL) arise by divergent evolution from a common mutated precursor through the acquisition of distinct genetic events. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers and antiapoptotic genes are introduced early in the common precursor, whereas tFL is specifically associated with alterations deregulating cell-cycle progression and DNA damage responses (CDKN2A/B, MYC, and TP53) as well as aberrant somatic hypermutation. The genomic profile of tFL shares similarities with that of germinal center B cell-type de novo DLBCL but also displays unique combinations of altered genes with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) is widely expressed throughout the human and animal organism, including the dorsal root ganglia as well as the bladder, stomach and small intestine. Here, we examined the effect of three platelet aggregation inhibitors on TRPA1: ticlopidine, clopidogrel and prasugrel. Utilising fluorometric Ca2+ influx analysis and electrophysiological whole cell measurements in TRPA1-expressing HEK293 and in human enterochromaffin-like QGP-1 cells, we found that ticlopidine, clopidogrel and prasugrel are direct activators of TRPA1. Although this polymodal channel commonly contributes to the perception of pain, temperature and chemical irritants, recent studies provide evidence for its involvement in the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells. Therefore, we further investigated the ability of ticlopidine, clopidogrel and prasugrel to stimulate 5-HT release from QGP-1 cells. We could determine 5-HT in supernatants from cultured QGP-1 cells upon treatment with ticlopidine and clopidogrel but not with prasugrel. These findings indicate that a robust TRPA1 activation by ticlopidine and clopidogrel correlates with the stimulatory effect on the secretion of 5-HT. As recipients of ticlopidine and clopidogrel frequently complain about gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, an activation of TRPA1 may contribute to adverse effects of such drugs in the digestive system.

Abstract: Summary
Plants continuously maintain pluripotent stem cells embedded in specialized tissues called meristems, which drive long-term growth and organogenesis. Stem cell fate in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is controlled by the homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) expressed in the niche adjacent to the stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that the bHLH transcription factor HECATE1 (HEC1) is a target of WUS and that it contributes to SAM function by promoting stem cell proliferation, while antagonizing niche cell activity. HEC1 represses the stem cell regulators WUS and CLAVATA3 (CLV3) and, like WUS, controls genes with functions in metabolism and hormone signaling. Among the targets shared by HEC1 and WUS are phytohormone response regulators, which we show to act as mobile signals in a universal feedback system. Thus, our work sheds light on the mechanisms guiding meristem function and suggests that the underlying regulatory system is far more complex than previously anticipated.

Abstract: Summary
VARP is a Rab32/38 effector that also binds to the endosomal/lysosomal R-SNARE VAMP7. VARP binding regulates VAMP7 participation in SNARE complex formation and can therefore influence VAMP7-mediated membrane fusion events. Mutant versions of VARP that cannot bind Rab32:GTP, designed on the basis of the VARP ankyrin repeat/Rab32:GTP complex structure described here, unexpectedly retain endosomal localization, showing that VARP recruitment is not dependent on Rab32 binding. We show that recruitment of VARP to the endosomal membrane is mediated by its direct interaction with VPS29, a subunit of the retromer complex, which is involved in trafficking from endosomes to the TGN and the cell surface. Transport of GLUT1 from endosomes to the cell surface requires VARP, VPS29, and VAMP7 and depends on the direct interaction between VPS29 and VARP. Finally, we propose that endocytic cycling of VAMP7 depends on its interaction with VARP and, consequently, also on retromer.

Abstract: Summary
Antisense transcription is widespread in many genomes; however, how much is functional is hotly debated. We are investigating functionality of a set of long noncoding antisense transcripts, collectively called COOLAIR, produced at Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). COOLAIR initiates just downstream of the major sense transcript poly(A) site and terminates either early or extends into the FLC promoter region. We now show that splicing of COOLAIR is functionally important. This was revealed through analysis of a hypomorphic mutation in the core spliceosome component PRP8. The prp8 mutation perturbs a cotranscriptional feedback mechanism linking COOLAIR processing to FLC gene body histone demethylation and reduced FLC transcription. The importance of COOLAIR splicing in this repression mechanism was confirmed by disrupting COOLAIR production and mutating the COOLAIR proximal splice acceptor site. Our findings suggest that altered splicing of a long noncoding transcript can quantitatively modulate gene expression through cotranscriptional coupling mechanisms.

Abstract: Moist Exposed Burn Ointment (MEBO®) is widely used topical agent applied on skin burn. This study investigated the effect of MEBO topical application on activation and proliferation of epidermal stem cells through the immunohistochemical localization of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) as a known marker expressed in epidermal stem cells. Biopsies from normal skin and burn wounds were taken from 21 patients with partial thickness burn 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after treatment with MEBO. Tissue sections were prepared for histological study and for CK19 immunohistochemical localization. In control skin, only few cells showed a positive CK19 immune-reaction. Burned skin showed necrosis of full thickness epidermis that extended to dermis. Gradual regeneration of skin accompanied with an enhancement in CK19 immune-reactivity was noted 4, 7, 14 and 21 days after treatment with MEBO. On day 28, a complete regeneration of skin was observed with a return of CK19 immune-reactivity to the basal pattern again. In conclusion, the enhancement of epidermal stem cell marker CK19 after treatment of partial thickness burn injuries with MEBO suggested the role of MEBO in promoting epidermal stem cell activation and proliferation during burn wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular chaperones triage misfolded proteins via action as substrate selectors for quality control (QC) machines that fold or degrade clients. Herein, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated Hsp40 JB12 is reported to participate in partitioning mutant conformers of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), a G protein-coupled receptor, between ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and an ERQC autophagy pathway. ERQC autophagy degrades E90K-GnRHR because pools of its partially folded and detergent-soluble degradation intermediates are resistant to ERAD. S168R-GnRHR is globally misfolded and disposed of via ERAD, but inhibition of p97, the protein retrotranslocation motor, shunts S168R-GnRHR from ERAD to ERQC autophagy. Partially folded and grossly misfolded forms of GnRHR associate with JB12 and Hsp70. Elevation of JB12 promotes ERAD of S168R-GnRHR, with E90K-GnRHR being resistant. E90K-GnRHR elicits association of the Vps34 autophagy initiation complex with JB12. Interaction between ER-associated Hsp40s and the Vps34 complex permits the selective degradation of ERAD-resistant membrane proteins via ERQC autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
During mitosis, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) monitors the attachment of kinetochores (KTs) to the plus ends of spindle microtubules (MTs) and prevents anaphase onset until chromosomes are aligned and KTs are under proper tension. Here, we identify a SAC component, BuGZ/ZNF207, from an RNAi viability screen in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain tumor stem cells. BuGZ binds to and stabilizes Bub3 during interphase and mitosis through a highly conserved GLE2p-binding sequence (GLEBS) domain. Inhibition of BuGZ results in loss of both Bub3 and its binding partner Bub1 from KTs, reduction of Bub1-dependent phosphorylation of centromeric histone H2A, attenuation of KT-based Aurora B kinase activity, and lethal chromosome congression defects in cancer cells. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that BuGZ orthologs are highly conserved among eukaryotes, but are conspicuously absent from budding and fission yeasts. These findings suggest that BuGZ has evolved to facilitate Bub3 activity and chromosome congression in higher eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Proper growth of the mammalian cerebral cortex is crucial for normal brain functions and is controlled by precise gene-expression regulation. Here, we show that microRNA-7 (miR-7) is highly expressed in cortical neural progenitors and describe miR-7 sponge transgenic mice in which miR-7-silencing activity is specifically knocked down in the embryonic cortex. Blocking miR-7 function causes microcephaly-like brain defects due to reduced intermediate progenitor (IP) production and apoptosis. Upregulation of miR-7 target genes, including those implicated in the p53 pathway, such as Ak1 and Cdkn1a (p21), is responsible for abnormalities in neural progenitors. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Ak1 or p21 and specific blockade of miR-7 binding sites in target genes using protectors in vivo induce similarly reduced IP production. Using conditional miRNA sponge transgenic approaches, we uncovered an unexpected role for miR-7 in cortical growth through its interactions with genes in the p53 pathway.

Abstract: This study proposes the quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model to characterize the time dependent mechanical behavior of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) sponges. The PVA sponges have implications in many viscoelastic soft tissues, including cartilage, liver, and kidney as an implant. However, a critical barrier to the use of the PVA sponge as tissue replacement material is a lack of sufficient study on its viscoelastic mechanical properties. In this study, the nonlinear mechanical behavior of a fabricated PVA sponge is investigated experimentally and computationally using relaxation and stress failure tests as well as finite element (FE) modeling. Hyperelastic strain energy density functions, such as Yeoh and Neo-Hookean, are used to capture the mechanical behavior of PVA sponge at ramp part, and viscoelastic model is used to describe the viscose behavior at hold part. Hyperelastic material constants are obtained and their general prediction ability is verified using FE simulations of PVA tensile experiments. The results of relaxation and stress failure tests revealed that Yeoh material model can define the mechanical behavior of PVA sponge properly compared with Neo-Hookean one. FE modeling results are also affirmed the appropriateness of Yeoh model to characterize the mechanical behavior of PVA sponge. Thus, the Yeoh model can be used in future biomechanical simulations of the spongy biomaterials. These results can be utilized to understand the viscoelastic behavior of PVA sponges and has implications for tissue engineering as scaffold.

Abstract: Summary
Clusters of simultaneous multiple mutations can be a source of rapid change during carcinogenesis and evolution. Such mutation clusters have been recently shown to originate from DNA damage within long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) formed at resected double-strand breaks and dysfunctional replication forks. Here, we identify double-strand break (DSB)-induced replication (BIR) as another powerful source of mutation clusters that formed in nearly half of wild-type yeast cells undergoing BIR in the presence of alkylating damage. Clustered mutations were primarily formed along the track of DNA synthesis and were frequently associated with additional breakage and rearrangements. Moreover, the base specificity, strand coordination, and strand bias of the mutation spectrum were consistent with mutations arising from damage in persistent ssDNA stretches within unconventional replication intermediates. Altogether, these features closely resemble kataegic events in cancers, suggesting that replication intermediates during BIR may be the most prominent source of mutation clusters across species.

Abstract: Summary
A deletion on human chromosome 16p11.2 is associated with autism spectrum disorders. We deleted the syntenic region on mouse chromosome 7F3. MRI and high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics revealed anatomical and cellular abnormalities, particularly in cortex and striatum of juvenile mutant mice (16p11+/−). We found elevated numbers of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the dopamine D2 receptor (Drd2+) and fewer dopamine-sensitive (Drd1+) neurons in deep layers of cortex. Electrophysiological recordings of Drd2+ MSN revealed synaptic defects, suggesting abnormal basal ganglia circuitry function in 16p11+/− mice. This is further supported by behavioral experiments showing hyperactivity, circling, and deficits in movement control. Strikingly, 16p11+/− mice showed a complete lack of habituation reminiscent of what is observed in some autistic individuals. Our findings unveil a fundamental role of genes affected by the 16p11.2 deletion in establishing the basal ganglia circuitry and provide insights in the pathophysiology of autism.

Abstract: Summary
The sesquiterpenoid abscisic acid (ABA) mediates an assortment of responses across a variety of kingdoms including both higher plants and animals. In plants, where most is known, a linear core ABA signaling pathway has been identified. However, the complexity of ABA-dependent gene expression suggests that ABA functions through an intricate network. Here, using systems biology approaches that focused on genes transcriptionally regulated by ABA, we defined an ABA signaling network of over 500 interactions among 138 proteins. This map greatly expanded ABA core signaling but was still manageable for systematic analysis. For example, functional analysis was used to identify an ABA module centered on two sucrose nonfermenting (SNF)-like kinases. We also used coexpression analysis of interacting partners within the network to uncover dynamic subnetwork structures in response to different abiotic stresses. This comprehensive ABA resource allows for application of approaches to understanding ABA functions in higher plants.

Abstract: Summary
Mutually exclusive activating mutations in the GNAQ and GNA11 oncogenes, encoding heterotrimeric Gαq family members, have been identified in ∼83% and ∼6% of uveal and skin melanomas, respectively. However, the molecular events underlying these GNAQ-driven malignancies are not yet defined, thus limiting the ability to develop cancer-targeted therapies. Here, we focused on the transcriptional coactivator YAP, a critical component of the Hippo signaling pathway that controls organ size. We found that Gαq stimulates YAP through a Trio-Rho/Rac signaling circuitry promoting actin polymerization, independently of phospholipase Cβ and the canonical Hippo pathway. Furthermore, we show that Gαq promotes the YAP-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells, thereby identifying YAP as a suitable therapeutic target in uveal melanoma, a GNAQ/GNA11-initiated human malignancy.

Abstract: Genomic datasets and the tools to analyze them have proliferated at an astonishing rate. However, such tools are often poorly integrated with each other: each program typically produces its own custom output in a variety of non-standard file formats. Here we present glbase, a framework that uses a flexible set of descriptors that can quickly parse non-binary data files. glbase includes many functions to intersect two lists of data, including operations on genomic interval data and support for the efficient random access to huge genomic data files. Many glbase functions can produce graphical outputs, including scatter plots, heatmaps, boxplots and other common analytical displays of high-throughput data such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and microarray expression data. glbase is designed to rapidly bring biological data into a Python-based analytical environment to facilitate analysis and data processing. In summary, glbase is a flexible and multifunctional toolkit that allows the combination and analysis of high-throughput data (especially next-generation sequencing and genome-wide data), and which has been instrumental in the analysis of complex data sets. glbase is freely available at http://bitbucket.org/oaxiom/glbase/.

Abstract: Layer 10 neurons of the chick tectum were morphologically investigated. The layer 10 neurons displayed heterogeneous immunoreactivities to calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs). Calbindin (CB)-immunoreactive (ir) neurons had pyramidal or round somata, primarily found in layers 5, 9, and 13. Parvalbumin (PV)-ir neurons were of various shapes with small to large somata (109.7±48.6μm2) that were located mainly in layers 4 and 10. Calretinin (CR)-ir neurons had small to middle-sized somata (79.3±9.7μm2) located primarily in layers 10 and 13, and most of them were similar to typical radial cells in size and shape. Two distinct types of neurons that projected to the nucleus geniculatus lateralis, pars ventralis (GLv) and ventral thalamus were demonstrated in layer 10. Type 1 cells had small to middle-sized somata (74.3±33μm2), and each cell had a single apical dendrite that ramified into bush-like branches in layer 7. These cells corresponded to CR-ir neurons and radial cells in size and shape. Type 2 cells had larger somata (124.7±52.6μm2), and their shapes were pyramidal, polygonal, or oval. They had multiple obliquely ascending dendrites that ramified into bush-like branches in layer 7. These cells often appeared similar to PV-ir neurons.

Mnk2 Alternative Splicing Modulates the p38-MAPK Pathway and Impacts Ras-Induced Transformation,

Abstract: Summary
The kinase Mnk2 is a substrate of the MAPK pathway and phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF4E. In humans, MKNK2, the gene encoding for Mnk2, is alternatively spliced yielding two splicing isoforms with differing last exons: Mnk2a, which contains a MAPK-binding domain, and Mnk2b, which lacks it. We found that the Mnk2a isoform is downregulated in breast, lung, and colon tumors and is tumor suppressive. Mnk2a directly interacts with, phosphorylates, activates, and translocates p38α-MAPK into the nucleus, leading to activation of its target genes, increasing cell death and suppression of Ras-induced transformation. Alternatively, Mnk2b is pro-oncogenic and does not activate p38-MAPK, while still enhancing eIF4E phosphorylation. We further show that Mnk2a colocalization with p38α-MAPK in the nucleus is both required and sufficient for its tumor-suppressive activity. Thus, Mnk2a downregulation by alternative splicing is a tumor suppressor mechanism that is lost in some breast, lung, and colon tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Circadian clocks play a major role in orchestrating daily physiology, and their disruption can evoke metabolic diseases such as fatty liver and obesity. To study the role of circadian clocks in lipid homeostasis, we performed an extensive lipidomic analysis of liver tissues from wild-type and clock-disrupted mice either fed ad libitum or night fed. To our surprise, a similar fraction of lipids (∼17%) oscillated in both mouse strains, most notably triglycerides, but with completely different phases. Moreover, several master lipid regulators (e.g., PPARα) and enzymes involved in triglyceride metabolism retained their circadian expression in clock-disrupted mice. Nighttime restricted feeding shifted the phase of triglyceride accumulation and resulted in ∼50% decrease in hepatic triglyceride levels in wild-type mice. Our findings suggest that circadian clocks and feeding time dictate the phase and levels of hepatic triglyceride accumulation; however, oscillations in triglycerides can persist in the absence of a functional clock.

Abstract: Summary
The three Akt isoforms are functionally distinct. Here we show that their phosphoproteomes also differ, suggesting that their functional differences are due to differences in target specificity. One of the top cellular functions differentially regulated by Akt isoforms is RNA processing. IWS1, an RNA processing regulator, is phosphorylated by Akt3 and Akt1 at Ser720/Thr721. The latter is required for the recruitment of SETD2 to the RNA Pol II complex. SETD2 trimethylates histone H3 at K36 during transcription, creating a docking site for MRG15 and PTB. H3K36me3-bound MRG15 and PTB regulate FGFR-2 splicing, which controls tumor growth and invasiveness downstream of IWS1 phosphorylation. Twenty-one of the twenty-four non-small-cell-lung carcinomas we analyzed express IWS1. More importantly, the stoichiometry of IWS1 phosphorylation in these tumors correlates with the FGFR-2 splicing pattern and with Akt phosphorylation and Akt3 expression. These data identify an Akt isoform-dependent regulatory mechanism for RNA processing and demonstrate its role in lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular process essential to the development and maintenance of solid tissues. In cancer, EMT suppresses apoptosis, but the mechanisms remain unclear. EMT selectively attenuated apoptosis signaling via the death receptors DR4 and DR5. Loss of the epithelial cell adhesion protein E-cadherin recapitulated this outcome, whereas homotypic E-cadherin engagement promoted apoptotic signaling via DR4/DR5, but not Fas. Depletion of α-catenin, which couples E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton, or actin polymerization inhibitors similarly attenuated DR4/DR5-induced apoptosis. E-cadherin bound specifically to ligated DR4/DR5, requiring extracellular cadherin domain 1 and calcium. E-cadherin augmented DR4/DR5 clustering and assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), increasing caspase-8 activation in high molecular weight cell fractions. Conversely, EMT attenuated DR4/DR5-mediated DISC formation and caspase-8 stimulation. Consistent with these findings, epithelial cancer cell lines expressing higher E-cadherin levels displayed greater sensitivity to DR4/DR5-mediated apoptosis. These results have potential implications for tissue homeostasis as well as cancer therapy.

Abstract: The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is a model plant for genome research in Solanaceae, as well as for studying crop breeding. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a valuable resource in genetic research and breeding. However, to do discovery of genome-wide SNPs, most methods require expensive high-depth sequencing. Here, we describe a method for SNP calling using a modified version of SAMtools that improved its sensitivity. We analyzed 90 Gb of raw sequence data from next-generation sequencing of two resequencing and seven transcriptome data sets from several tomato accessions. Our study identified 4,812,432 non-redundant SNPs. Moreover, the workflow of SNP calling was improved by aligning the reference genome with its own raw data. Using this approach, 131,785 SNPs were discovered from transcriptome data of seven accessions. In addition, 4,680,647 SNPs were identified from the genome of S. pimpinellifolium, which are 60 times more than 71,637 of the PI212816 transcriptome. SNP distribution was compared between the whole genome and transcriptome of S. pimpinellifolium. Moreover, we surveyed the location of SNPs within genic and intergenic regions. Our results indicated that the sufficient genome-wide SNP markers and very sensitive SNP calling method allow for application of marker assisted breeding and genome-wide association studies.

Abstract: Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) has been identified as an important modulator of Ca2+ release from the endo-lysosomal system in a variety of cells by a new and ubiquitous class of endo-lysosomal ion channels known as the two-pore channels (TPCs). However, the role of TPCs in NAADP action in smooth muscle is not known. In the present work, we investigated the effects of NAADP in gastric smooth muscle cells and its ability to release Ca2+ by TPCs. We show that Ca2+ signals mediated by NAADP were inhibited by disrupting Ca2+ handling by either acidic organelles (using bafilomycin A1) or the Endoplasmic Reticulum (using thapsigargin, ryanodine or 2-APB). Transcripts for endogenous TPC1 and TPC2 were readily detected and recombinant TPCs localized to the endosomes and/or lysosomes. Overexpression of wild-type TPCs but not pore mutants enhanced NAADP-mediated cytosolic Ca2+ signals. Desensitizing the NAADP pathway inhibited Ca2+-responses to extracellular stimulation with carbachol but not ATP. Taken together, these results indicate that NAADP likely induces Ca2+ release from the endolysosomal system through TPCs which is subsequently amplified via the ER in an agonist-specific manner. Thus, we suggest a second messenger role for NAADP in smooth muscle cells.

Abstract: As a tumor suppressor homologue during mitosis, Chk2 is involved in replication checkpoints, DNA repair, and cell cycle arrest, although its functions during mouse oocyte meiosis and early embryo development remain uncertain. We investigated the functions of Chk2 during mouse oocyte maturation and early embryo development. Chk2 exhibited a dynamic localization pattern; Chk2 expression was restricted to germinal vesicles at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, was associated with centromeres at pro-metaphase I (Pro-MI), and localized to spindle poles at metaphase I (MI). Disrupting Chk2 activity resulted in cell cycle progression defects. First, inhibitor-treated oocytes were arrested at the GV stage and failed to undergo germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD); this could be rescued after Chk2 inhibition release. Second, Chk2 inhibition after oocyte GVBD caused MI arrest. Third, the first cleavage of early embryo development was disrupted by Chk2 inhibition. Additionally, in inhibitor-treated oocytes, checkpoint protein Bub3 expression was consistently localized at centromeres at the MI stage, which indicated that the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) was activated. Moreover, disrupting Chk2 activity in oocytes caused severe chromosome misalignments and spindle disruption. In inhibitor-treated oocytes, centrosome protein γ-tubulin and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) were dissociated from spindle poles. These results indicated that Chk2 regulated cell cycle progression and spindle assembly during mouse oocyte maturation and early embryo development.

Abstract: Summary
Binding of insulin receptor substrate proteins 1 and 2 (IRS1/2) to the insulin receptor (IR) is essential for the regulation of insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis. However, the mechanism of IRS1/2 recruitment to the IR remains elusive. Here, we identify adaptor protein APPL1 as a critical molecule that promotes IRS1/2-IR interaction. APPL1 forms a complex with IRS1/2 under basal conditions, and this complex is then recruited to the IR in response to insulin or adiponectin stimulation. The interaction between APPL1 and IR depends on insulin- or adiponectin-stimulated APPL1 phosphorylation, which is greatly reduced in insulin target tissues in obese mice. appl1 deletion in mice consistently leads to systemic insulin resistance and a significant reduction in insulin-stimulated IRS1/2, but not IR, tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that APPL1 sensitizes insulin signaling by acting at a site downstream of the IR. Our study uncovers a mechanism regulating insulin signaling and crosstalk between the insulin and adiponectin pathways.

Abstract: Summary
The model for telomere shortening at each replication cycle is currently incomplete, and the exact contribution of the telomeric 3′ overhang to the shortening rate remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate key steps of the mechanism of telomere replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By following the dynamics of telomeres during replication at near-nucleotide resolution, we find that the leading-strand synthesis generates blunt-end intermediates before being 5′-resected and filled in. Importantly, the shortening rate is set by positioning the last Okazaki fragments at the very ends of the chromosome. Thus, telomeres shorten in direct proportion to the 3′ overhang lengths of 5–10 nucleotides that are present in parental templates. Furthermore, the telomeric protein Cdc13 coordinates leading- and lagging-strand syntheses. Taken together, our data unravel a precise choreography of telomere replication elucidating the DNA end-replication problem and provide a framework to understand the control of the cell proliferation potential.

Abstract: Adipose-derived stem cells represent a type of mesenchymal stem cells with the attendant capacity to self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell lineages. We have performed a microarray-based gene expression profiling of osteogenic differentiation and found that the transcription factor Sox11 is down-regulated during the process. Functional assays demonstrate that down-regulation of Sox11 is required for an efficient differentiation. Furthermore, results from forced expression of constitutively-active and dominant-negative derivatives of Sox11 indicate that Sox11 functions as a transcriptional activator in inhibiting osteogenesis. Sox11 thus represents a novel regulator of osteogenesis whose expression and activity can be potentially manipulated for controlled differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Condensin is a central regulator of mitotic genome structure with mutants showing poorly condensed chromosomes and profound segregation defects. Here, we identify NCT, a complex comprising the Nrc1 BET-family tandem bromodomain protein (SPAC631.02), casein kinase II (CKII), and several TAFs, as a regulator of condensin function. We show that NCT and condensin bind similar genomic regions but only briefly colocalize during the periods of chromosome condensation and decondensation. This pattern of NCT binding at the core centromere, the region of maximal condensin enrichment, tracks the abundance of acetylated histone H4, as regulated by the Hat1-Mis16 acetyltransferase complex and recognized by the first Nrc1 bromodomain. Strikingly, mutants in NCT or Hat1-Mis16 restore the formation of segregation-competent chromosomes in cells containing defective condensin. These results are consistent with a model where NCT targets CKII to chromatin in a cell-cycle-directed manner in order to modulate the activity of condensin during chromosome condensation and decondensation.

Abstract: Summary
Metastasis is the major cause of death in cancer patients, yet the genetic and epigenetic programs that drive metastasis are poorly understood. Here, we report an epigenetic reprogramming pathway that is required for breast cancer metastasis. Concerted differential DNA methylation is initiated by the activation of the RON receptor tyrosine kinase by its ligand, macrophage stimulating protein (MSP). Through PI3K signaling, RON/MSP promotes expression of the G:T mismatch-specific thymine glycosylase MBD4. RON/MSP and MBD4-dependent aberrant DNA methylation results in the misregulation of a specific set of genes. Knockdown of MBD4 reverses methylation at these specific loci and blocks metastasis. We also show that the MBD4 glycosylase catalytic residue is required for RON/MSP-driven metastasis. Analysis of human breast cancers revealed that this epigenetic program is significantly associated with poor clinical outcome. Furthermore, inhibition of Ron kinase activity with a pharmacological agent blocks metastasis of patient-derived breast tumor grafts in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
We developed and applied a Cre-dependent, genetically modified rabies-based tracing system to map direct synaptic connections to specific CA1 neuron types in the mouse hippocampus. We found common inputs to excitatory and inhibitory CA1 neurons from CA3, CA2, the entorhinal cortex (EC), the medial septum (MS), and, unexpectedly, the subiculum. Excitatory CA1 neurons receive inputs from both cholinergic and GABAergic MS neurons, whereas inhibitory neurons receive a great majority of inputs from GABAergic MS neurons. Both cell types also receive weaker input from glutamatergic MS neurons. Comparisons of inputs to CA1 PV+ interneurons versus SOM+ interneurons showed similar strengths of input from the subiculum, but PV+ interneurons received much stronger input than SOM+ neurons from CA3, the EC, and the MS. Thus, rabies tracing identifies hippocampal circuit connections and maps how the different input sources to CA1 are distributed with different strengths on each of its constituent cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Hexokinase-II (HK-II) catalyzes the first step of glycolysis and also functions as a protective molecule; however, its role in protective autophagy has not been determined. Results showed that inhibition of HK-II diminished, while overexpression of HK-II potentiated, autophagy induced by glucose deprivation in cardiomyocyte and noncardiomyocyte cells. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that HK-II binds to and inhibits the autophagy suppressor, mTOR complex 1 (TORC1), and that this binding was increased by glucose deprivation. The TOS motif, a scaffold sequence responsible for binding TORC1 substrates, is present in HK-II, and mutating it blocked its ability to bind to TORC1 and regulate protective autophagy. The transition from glycolysis to autophagy appears to be regulated by a decrease in glucose-6 phosphate. We suggest that HK-II binds TORC1 as a decoy substrate and provides a previously unrecognized mechanism for switching cells from a metabolic economy, based on plentiful energy, to one of conservation, under starvation.

Fold Change of Nuclear NF-κB Determines TNF-Induced Transcription in Single Cells,

Abstract: Summary
In response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF), NF-κB enters the nucleus and promotes inflammatory and stress-responsive gene transcription. Because NF-κB deregulation is associated with disease, one might expect strict control of NF-κB localization. However, nuclear NF-κB levels exhibit considerable cell-to-cell variability, even in unstimulated cells. To resolve this paradox and determine how transcription-inducing signals are encoded, we quantified single-cell NF-κB translocation dynamics and transcription in the same cells. We show that TNF-induced transcription correlates best with fold change in nuclear NF-κB, not absolute nuclear NF-κB abundance. Using computational modeling, we find that an incoherent feedforward loop, from competition for binding to κB motifs, could provide memory of the preligand state necessary for fold-change detection. Experimentally, we observed three gene-specific transcriptional patterns that our model recapitulates by modulating competition strength alone. Fold-change detection buffers against stochastic variation in signaling molecules and explains how cells tolerate variability in NF-κB abundance and localization.

Abstract: Summary
While structural symmetry is a prevailing feature of homo-oligomeric proteins, asymmetry provides unique mechanistic opportunities. We present the crystal structure of full-length TRAP1, the mitochondrial Hsp90 molecular chaperone, in a catalytically active closed state. The TRAP1 homodimer adopts a distinct, asymmetric conformation, where one protomer is reconfigured via a helix swap at the middle:C-terminal domain (MD:CTD) interface. This interface plays a critical role in client binding. Solution methods validate the asymmetry and show extension to Hsp90 homologs. Point mutations that disrupt unique contacts at each MD:CTD interface reduce catalytic activity and substrate binding and demonstrate that each protomer needs access to both conformations. Crystallographic data on a dimeric NTD:MD fragment suggests that asymmetry arises from strain induced by simultaneous NTD and CTD dimerization. The observed asymmetry provides the potential for an additional step in the ATPase cycle, allowing sequential ATP hydrolysis steps to drive both client remodeling and client release.

Abstract: Mitigating secondary delayed neuronal injury has been a therapeutic strategy for minimizing neurological symptoms after several types of brain injury. Interestingly, secondary neuronal loss appeared to be closely related to functional loss and/or death of astrocytes. In the brain damage induced by agonists of two glutamate receptors, N-ethyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and kainic acid (KA), NMDA induced neuronal death within 3 h, but did not increase further thereafter. However, in the KA-injected brain, neuronal death was not obviously detectable even at injection sites at 3 h, but extensively increased to encompass the entire hemisphere at 7 days. Brain inflammation, a possible cause of secondary neuronal damage, showed little differences between the two models. Importantly, however, astrocyte behavior was completely different. In the NMDA-injected cortex, the loss of glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing (GFAP+) astrocytes was confined to the injection site until 7 days after the injection, and astrocytes around the damage sites showed extensive gliosis and appeared to isolate the damage sites. In contrast, in the KA-injected brain, GFAP+ astrocytes, like neurons, slowly, but progressively, disappeared across the entire hemisphere. Other markers of astrocytes, including S100β, glutamate transporter EAAT2, the potassium channel Kir4.1 and glutamine synthase, showed patterns similar to that of GFAP in both NMDA- and KA-injected cortexes. More importantly, astrocyte disappearance and/or functional loss preceded neuronal death in the KA-injected brain. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of astrocyte support to neurons may be a critical cause of delayed neuronal death in the injured brain.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a histone methyltransferase that is localized to thousands of mammalian genes. Though important to human disease and as a drug target, how PRC2 is recruited remains unclear. One model invokes cis-regulatory RNA. Herein, we biochemically and functionally probe PRC2’s recognition of RNA using the X-inactivation model. We observe surprisingly high discriminatory capabilities. While SUZ12 and JARID2 subunits can bind RNA, EZH2 has highest affinity and is somewhat promiscuous. EED regulates the affinity of EZH2 for RNA, lending greater specificity to PRC2-RNA interactions. Intriguingly, while RNA is crucial for targeting, RNA inhibits EZH2’s catalytic activity. JARID2 weakens PRC2’s binding to RNA and relieves catalytic inhibition. We propose that RNA guides PRC2 to its target but inhibits its enzymatic activity until PRC2 associates with JARID2 on chromatin. Our study provides a molecular view of regulatory interactions between RNA and PRC2 at the chromatin interface.

Abstract: Summary
Recurring deletions of chromosome 7 and 7q [−7/del(7q)] occur in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor prognosis. However, the identity of functionally relevant tumor suppressors on 7q remains unclear. Using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches, we show that an ∼50% reduction in gene dosage of the mixed lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3) gene, located on 7q36.1, cooperates with other events occurring in −7/del(7q) AMLs to promote leukemogenesis. Mll3 suppression impairs the differentiation of HSPC. Interestingly, Mll3-suppressed leukemias, like human −7/del(7q) AMLs, are refractory to conventional chemotherapy but sensitive to the BET inhibitor JQ1. Thus, our mouse model functionally validates MLL3 as a haploinsufficient 7q tumor suppressor and suggests a therapeutic option for this aggressive disease.

Abstract: Summary
Downregulation of the schizophrenia-associated gene DISC1 and its interacting protein FEZ1 positively regulates dendrite growth in young neurons. However, little is known about the mechanism that controls these molecules during neuronal development. Here, we identify several components of the ubiquitin proteasome system and the cell-cycle machinery that act upstream of FEZ1. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase cell division cycle 20/anaphase-promoting complex (Cdc20/APC) controls dendrite growth by regulating the degradation of FEZ1. Furthermore, dendrite growth is modulated by BubR1, whose known function so far has been restricted to control Cdc20/APC activity during the cell cycle. The modulatory function of BubR1 is dependent on its acetylation status. We show that BubR1 is deacetylated by Hdac11, thereby disinhibiting the Cdc20/APC complex. Because dendrite growth is affected both in hippocampal dentate granule cells and olfactory bulb neurons upon modifying expression of these genes, we conclude that the proposed mechanism governs neuronal development in a general fashion.

Abstract: Summary
The oocyte-to-embryo transition marks the onset of development. The initial phase of this profound change from the differentiated oocyte to the totipotent embryo occurs in the absence of both transcription and mRNA degradation. Here we combine global polysome profiling, ribosome-footprint profiling, and quantitative mass spectrometry in a comprehensive approach to delineate the translational and proteomic changes that occur during this important transition in Drosophila. Our results show that PNG kinase is a critical regulator of the extensive changes in the translatome, acting uniquely at this developmental window. Analysis of the proteome in png mutants provided insights into the contributions of translation to changes in protein levels, revealing a compensatory dynamic between translation and protein turnover during proteome remodeling at the return to totipotency. The proteome changes additionally suggested regulators of meiosis and early embryogenesis, including the conserved H3K4 demethylase LID, which we demonstrated is required during this period despite transcriptional inactivity.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are identified by their ability to sustain prolonged blood cell production in vivo, although recent evidence suggests that durable self-renewal (DSR) is shared by HSC subtypes with distinct self-perpetuating differentiation programs. Net expansions of DSR-HSCs occur in vivo, but molecularly defined conditions that support similar responses in vitro are lacking. We hypothesized that this might require a combination of factors that differentially promote HSC viability, proliferation, and self-renewal. We now demonstrate that HSC survival and maintenance of DSR potential are variably supported by different Steel factor (SF)-containing cocktails with similar HSC-mitogenic activities. In addition, stromal cells produce other factors, including nerve growth factor and collagen 1, that can antagonize the apoptosis of initially quiescent adult HSCs and, in combination with SF and interleukin-11, produce >15-fold net expansions of DSR-HSCs ex vivo within 7 days. These findings point to the molecular basis of HSC control and expansion.

Abstract: The females of some species of the family Halophilosciidae receive in the course of mating a quantity of sperm considerably redundant with respect to the number of eggs that can be fertilized; this is possible thanks to the peculiar morpho-functional organization that characterizes their genital system and that allows them to store the sperm not only in the great seminal receptacle but also within the ovary. While most of the sperm stay free in the lumen of the seminal receptacle, a part of those present in the ovary undergoes a process of capture by the follicular cells with consequent internalization within endocellular cavities. This process concerns exclusively the immotile tail, that characterizes the peculiar spermatozoon of the isopods and which is essentially of proteic nature. After their capture the sperm tails undergo a gradual process of digestion, which seems to be apparently realized without the intervention of lysosomes. The possible role of this spermiophagic activity might be to represent a significant trophic paternal investment aimed at improving the fitness of the female and of the offsprings.

Abstract: SIFamide receptor (SIFR) is a Drosophila G protein-coupled receptor for the neuropeptide SIFamide (SIFa). Although the sequence and spatial expression of SIFa are evolutionarily conserved among insect species, the physiological function of SIFa/SIFR signaling remains elusive. Here, we provide genetic evidence that SIFa and SIFR promote sleep in Drosophila. Either genetic ablation of SIFa-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis (PI) or pan-neuronal depletion of SIFa expression shortened baseline sleep and reduced sleep-bout length, suggesting that it caused sleep fragmentation. Consistently, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of SIFR expression caused short sleep phenotypes as observed in SIFa-ablated or depleted flies. Using a panel of neuron-specific Gal4 drivers, we further mapped SIFR effects to subsets of PI neurons. Taken together, these results reveal a novel physiological role of the neuropeptide SIFa/SIFR pathway to regulate sleep through sleep-promoting neural circuits in the PI of adult fly brains.

Abstract: Summary
Produced from the pathogenicity islands of Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates, stable SprG1 RNA encodes two peptides from a single internal reading frame. These two peptides accumulate at the membrane, and inducing their expression triggers S. aureus death. Replacement of the two initiation codons by termination signals reverses this toxicity. During growth, cis-antisense RNA SprF1 is expressed, preventing mortality by reducing SprG1 RNA and peptide levels. The peptides are secreted extracellularly, where they lyse human host erythrocytes, a process performed more efficiently by the longer peptide. The two peptides also inactivate Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, with the shorter peptide more effective against S. aureus rivals. Two peptides are secreted from an individual RNA containing two functional initiation codons. Thus, we present an unconventional type I toxin-antitoxin system expressed from a human pathogen producing two hemolytic and antibacterial peptides from a dual-coding RNA, negatively regulated by a dual-acting antisense RNA.

Abstract: Summary
NCOA4 is a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear hormone receptors that undergoes gene rearrangement in human cancer. By combining studies in Xenopus laevis egg extracts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we show here that NCOA4 is a minichromosome maintenance 7 (MCM7)-interacting protein that is able to control DNA replication. Depletion-reconstitution experiments in Xenopus laevis egg extracts indicate that NCOA4 acts as an inhibitor of DNA replication origin activation by regulating CMG (CDC45/MCM2–7/GINS) helicase. NCOA4−/− MEFs display unscheduled origin activation and reduced interorigin distance; this results in replication stress, as shown by the presence of fork stalling, reduction of fork speed, and premature senescence. Together, our findings indicate that NCOA4 acts as a regulator of DNA replication origins that helps prevent inappropriate DNA synthesis and replication stress.

Abstract: Summary
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling compound in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In plants, NO regulates critical developmental transitions and stress responses. Here, we identify a mechanism for NO sensing that coordinates responses throughout development based on targeted degradation of plant-specific transcriptional regulators, the group VII ethylene response factors (ERFs). We show that the N-end rule pathway of targeted proteolysis targets these proteins for destruction in the presence of NO, and we establish them as critical regulators of diverse NO-regulated processes, including seed germination, stomatal closure, and hypocotyl elongation. Furthermore, we define the molecular mechanism for NO control of germination and crosstalk with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling through ERF-regulated expression of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5). Our work demonstrates how NO sensing is integrated across multiple physiological processes by direct modulation of transcription factor stability and identifies group VII ERFs as central hubs for the perception of gaseous signals in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Monomethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me1) is a well-established feature of enhancers and promoters, although its function is unknown. Here, we uncover roles for H3K4me1 in diverse cell types. Remarkably, we find that MLL3/4 provokes monomethylation of promoter regions and the conditional repression of muscle and inflammatory response genes in myoblasts. During myogenesis, muscle genes are activated, lose MLL3 occupancy, and become H3K4-trimethylated through an alternative COMPASS complex. Monomethylation-mediated repression was not restricted to skeletal muscle. Together with H3K27me3 and H4K20me1, H3K4me1 was associated with transcriptional silencing in embryonic fibroblasts, macrophages, and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). On promoters of active genes, we find that H3K4me1 spatially demarcates the recruitment of factors that interact with H3K4me3, including ING1, which, in turn, recruits Sin3A. Our findings point to a unique role for H3K4 monomethylation in establishing boundaries that restrict the recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes to defined regions within promoters.

Abstract: Summary
How cues that trigger the wound response result in tissue healing is a question of immense biological and medical importance. Here we uncover roles for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) during Drosophila dorsal closure, a model for wound healing. By using real-time visualization of ROS activity and single-cell perturbation strategies, we demonstrate that stochasticities in ROS generation in the amnioserosa are necessary and sufficient to trigger cell delamination. We identify dose-dependent effects of mtROS on actomyosin and mitochondrial architecture, dynamics, and activity that mediate both stochasticities in cell behavior and the phases of tissue dynamics accompanying dorsal closure. Our results establish that ROS levels tune cell behavior and tissue dynamics qualitatively and quantitatively. They identify a pathway triggered by ROS and mediated by the Rho effector ROCK and its substrates that influences tissue patterning and homeostasis through the coordinate regulation of both mitochondrial morphology and tissue tension.

A Role for Retrotransposon LINE-1 in Fetal Oocyte Attrition in Mice,

Abstract: Summary
Fetal oocyte attrition (FOA) is a conserved but poorly understood process of elimination of more than two-thirds of meiotic prophase I (MPI) oocytes before birth. We now implicate retrotransposons LINE-1 (L1), activated during epigenetic reprogramming of the embryonic germline, in FOA in mice. We show that wild-type fetal oocytes possess differential nuclear levels of L1ORF1p, an L1-encoded protein essential for L1 ribonucleoprotein particle (L1RNP) formation and L1 retrotransposition. We demonstrate that experimental elevation of L1 expression correlates with increased MPI defects, FOA, oocyte aneuploidy, and embryonic lethality. Conversely, reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor AZT has a profound effect on the FOA dynamics and meiotic recombination, and it implicates an RT-dependent trigger in oocyte elimination in early MPI. We propose that FOA serves to select oocytes with limited L1 activity that are therefore best suited for the next generation.

Abstract: Summary
The Drosophila Bithorax complex (BX-C) Hox cluster contains a bidirectionally transcribed miRNA locus, and a deletion mutant (Δmir) lays no eggs and is completely sterile. We show these miRNAs are expressed and active in distinct spatial registers along the anterior-posterior axis in the CNS. Δmir larvae derepress a network of direct homeobox gene targets in the posterior ventral nerve cord (VNC), including BX-C genes and their TALE cofactors. These are phenotypically critical targets, because sterility of Δmir mutants was substantially rescued by heterozygosity of these genes. The posterior VNC contains Ilp7+ oviduct motoneurons, whose innervation and morphology are defective in Δmir females, and substantially rescued by heterozygosity of Δmir targets, especially within the BX-C. Collectively, we reveal (1) critical roles for Hox miRNAs that determine segment-specific expression of homeotic genes, which are not masked by transcriptional regulation; and (2) that BX-C miRNAs are essential for neural patterning and reproductive behavior.

Abstract: Summary
The traditional view of macrolide antibiotics as plugs inside the ribosomal nascent peptide exit tunnel (NPET) has lately been challenged in favor of a more complex, heterogeneous mechanism, where drug-peptide interactions determine the fate of a translating ribosome. To investigate these highly dynamic processes, we applied single-molecule tracking of elongating ribosomes during inhibition of elongation by erythromycin of several nascent chains, including ErmCL and H-NS, which were shown to be, respectively, sensitive and resistant to erythromycin. Peptide sequence-specific changes were observed in translation elongation dynamics in the presence of a macrolide-obstructed NPET. Elongation rates were not severely inhibited in general by the presence of the drug; instead, stalls or pauses were observed as abrupt events. The dynamic pathways of nascent-chain-dependent elongation pausing in the presence of macrolides determine the fate of the translating ribosome stalling or readthrough.

Abstract: Summary
Diet has a substantial impact on cellular metabolism and physiology. Animals must sense different food sources and utilize distinct strategies to adapt to diverse diets. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan is regulated by their adaptive capacity to different diets, which is controlled by alh-6, a conserved proline metabolism gene. alh-6 mutants age prematurely when fed an Escherichia coli OP50 but not HT115 diet. Remarkably, this diet-dependent aging phenotype is determined by exposure to food during development. Mechanistically, the alh-6 mutation triggers diet-induced mitochondrial defects and increased generation of ROS, likely due to accumulation of its substrate 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. We also identify that neuromedin U receptor signaling is essential for diet-induced mitochondrial changes and premature aging. Moreover, dietary restriction requires alh-6 to induce longevity. Collectively, our data reveal a homeostatic mechanism that animals employ to cope with potential dietary insults and uncover an example of lifespan regulation by dietary adaptation.

Abstract: The prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated system (Cas) is a simple, robust and efficient technique for gene targeting in model organisms such as zebrafish, mice and rats. In this report, we applied CRISPR technology to rabbits by microinjection of Cas9 mRNA and guided RNA (gRNA) into the cytoplasm of pronuclear-stage embryos. We achieved biallelic gene knockout (KO) rabbits by injection of 1 gene (IL2rg) or 2 gene (IL2rg and RAG1) Cas9 mRNA and gRNA with an efficiency of 100%. We also tested the efficiency of multiple gene KOs in early rabbit embryos and found that the efficiency of simultaneous gene mutation on target sites is as high as 100% for 3 genes (IL2rg, RAG1 and RAG2) and 33.3% for 5 genes (IL2rg, RAG1, RAG2, TIKI1 and ALB). Our results demonstrate that the Cas9/gRNA system is a highly efficient and fast tool not only for single-gene editing but also for multi-gene editing in rabbits.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of key regulators of lipid metabolism and thermogenic functions has important therapeutic implications for the current obesity and diabetes epidemic. Here, we show that Grb10, a direct substrate of mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is expressed highly in brown adipose tissue, and its expression in white adipose tissue is markedly induced by cold exposure. In adipocytes, mTOR-mediated phosphorylation at Ser501/503 switches the binding preference of Grb10 from the insulin receptor to raptor, leading to the dissociation of raptor from mTOR and downregulation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Fat-specific disruption of Grb10 increased mTORC1 signaling in adipose tissues, suppressed lipolysis, and reduced thermogenic function. The effects of Grb10 deficiency on lipolysis and thermogenesis were diminished by rapamycin administration in vivo. Our study has uncovered a unique feedback mechanism regulating mTORC1 signaling in adipose tissues and identified Grb10 as a key regulator of adiposity, thermogenesis, and energy expenditure.

Germline Quality Control: eEF2K Stands Guard to Eliminate Defective Oocytes,

Abstract: Summary
The control of germline quality is critical to reproductive success and survival of a species; however, the mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), an evolutionarily conserved regulator of protein synthesis, functions to maintain germline quality and eliminate defective oocytes. We show that disruption of eEF2K in mice reduces ovarian apoptosis and results in the accumulation of aberrant follicles and defective oocytes at advanced reproductive age. Furthermore, the loss of eEF2K in Caenorhabditis elegans results in a reduction of germ cell death and significant decline in oocyte quality and embryonic viability. Examination of the mechanisms by which eEF2K regulates apoptosis shows that eEF2K senses oxidative stress and quickly downregulates short-lived antiapoptotic proteins, XIAP and c-FLIPL by inhibiting global protein synthesis. These results suggest that eEF2K-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis renders cells susceptible to apoptosis and functions to eliminate suboptimal germ cells.

Calcineurin Regulates Coordinated Outgrowth of Zebrafish Regenerating Fins,

Abstract: Summary
Vertebrates develop organs and appendages in a proportionally coordinated manner, and animals that regenerate them do so to the same dimensions as the original structures. Coordinated proportional growth involves controlled regulation between allometric and isometric growth programs, but it is unclear what executes this control. We show that calcineurin inhibition results in continued allometric outgrowth of regenerating fins beyond their original dimensions. Calcineurin inhibition also maintains allometric growth of juvenile fins and induces it in adult fins. Furthermore, calcineurin activity is low when the regeneration rate is highest, and its activity increases as the rate decreases. Growth measurements and morphometric analysis of proximodistal asymmetry indicate that calcineurin inhibition shifts fin regeneration from a distal growth program to a proximal program. This shift is associated with the promotion of retinoic acid signaling. Thus, we identified a calcineurin-mediated mechanism that operates as a molecular switch between position-associated isometric and allometric growth programs.

Abstract: Summary
CCR4-NOT is a major effector complex in miRNA-mediated gene silencing. It is recruited to miRNA targets through interactions with tryptophan (W)-containing motifs in TNRC6/GW182 proteins and is required for both translational repression and degradation of miRNA targets. Here, we elucidate the structural basis for the repressive activity of CCR4-NOT and its interaction with TNRC6/GW182s. We show that the conserved CNOT9 subunit attaches to a domain of unknown function (DUF3819) in the CNOT1 scaffold. The resulting complex provides binding sites for TNRC6/GW182, and its crystal structure reveals tandem W-binding pockets located in CNOT9. We further show that the CNOT1 MIF4G domain interacts with the C-terminal RecA domain of DDX6, a translational repressor and decapping activator. The crystal structure of this complex demonstrates striking similarity to the eIF4G-eIF4A complex. Together, our data provide the missing physical links in a molecular pathway that connects miRNA target recognition with translational repression, deadenylation, and decapping.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor endothelial cells (ECs) promote cancer progression in ways beyond their role as conduits supporting metabolism. However, it is unknown how vascular niche-derived paracrine factors, defined as angiocrine factors, provoke tumor aggressiveness. Here, we show that FGF4 produced by B cell lymphoma cells (LCs) through activating FGFR1 upregulates the Notch ligand Jagged1 (Jag1) on neighboring ECs. In turn, upregulation of Jag1 on ECs reciprocally induces Notch2-Hey1 in LCs. This crosstalk enforces aggressive CD44+IGF1R+CSF1R+ LC phenotypes, including extranodal invasion and chemoresistance. Inducible EC-selective deletion of Fgfr1 or Jag1 in the Eμ-Myc lymphoma model or impairing Notch2 signaling in mouse and human LCs diminished lymphoma aggressiveness and prolonged mouse survival. Thus, targeting the angiocrine FGF4-FGFR1/Jag1-Notch2 loop inhibits LC aggressiveness and enhances chemosensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired phosphatase activity contributes to the persistent activation of STAT3 in tumors. Given that STAT family members with various or even opposite functions are often phosphorylated or dephosphorylated by the same enzymes, the mechanism for STAT3-specific dephosphorylation in cells remains largely unknown. Here, we report that GdX (UBL4A) promotes STAT3 dephosphorylation via mediating the interaction between TC45 (the nuclear isoform of TC-PTP) and STAT3 specifically. GdX stabilizes the TC45-STAT3 complex to bestow upon STAT3 an efficient dephosphorylation by TC45. Inasmuch, GdX suppresses tumorigenesis and tumor development by reducing the level of phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3), whereas deletion of GdX results in a high level of p-STAT3 and accelerated colorectal tumorigenesis induced by AOM/DSS. Thus, GdX converts TC45, a nonspecific phosphatase, into a STAT3-specific phosphatase by bridging an association between TC45 and STAT3.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNA deregulation is frequent in human colorectal cancers (CRCs), but little is known as to whether it represents a bystander event or actually drives tumor progression in vivo. We show that miR-135b overexpression is triggered in mice and humans by APC loss, PTEN/PI3K pathway deregulation, and SRC overexpression and promotes tumor transformation and progression. We show that miR-135b upregulation is common in sporadic and inflammatory bowel disease-associated human CRCs and correlates with tumor stage and poor clinical outcome. Inhibition of miR-135b in CRC mouse models reduces tumor growth by controlling genes involved in proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis. We identify miR-135b as a key downsteam effector of oncogenic pathways and a potential target for CRC treatment.

Abstract: Eph receptors and their ligands ephrins have been implicated in guiding the directed migration of neural crest cells (NCCs). In this study, we found that Wnt1-Cre-mediated expression of ephrinA5-Fc along the dorsal midline of the dien- and mesencephalon resulted in severe craniofacial malformation of mouse embryo. Interestingly, expression of cephalic NCC markers decreased significantly in the frontonasal process and branchial arches 1 and 2, which are target areas for the migratory cephalic NCCs originating in the dien- and mesencephalon. In addition, these craniofacial tissues were much smaller in mutant embryos expressing ephrinA5-Fc. Importantly, EphA7-positive cephalic NCCs were absent along the dorsal dien- and mesencephalon of mutant embryos expressing ephrinA5-Fc, suggesting that the generation of cephalic NCCs is disrupted due to ephrinA5-Fc expression. NCC explant experiments suggested that ephrinA5-Fc perturbed survival of cephalic NCC precursors in the dorsal midline tissue rather than affecting their migratory capacity, which was consistent with our previous report that expression of ephrinA5-Fc in the dorsal midline is responsible for severe neuroepithelial cell apoptotic death. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that expression of ephrinA5-Fc decreases a population of cephalic NCC precursors in the dorsal midline of the dien- and mesencephalon, thereby disrupting craniofacial development in the mouse embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Dimeric RING E3 ligases interact with protein substrates and conformationally restrain the ubiquitin-E2-conjugating enzyme thioester complex such that it is primed for catalysis. RNF4 is an E3 ligase containing an N-terminal domain that binds its polySUMO substrates and a C-terminal RING domain responsible for dimerization. To investigate how RNF4 activity is controlled, we increased polySUMO substrate concentration by ablating expression of SUMO protease SENP6. Accumulation of SUMO chains in vivo leads to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of RNF4. In vitro we demonstrate that at concentrations equivalent to those found in vivo RNF4 is predominantly monomeric and inactive as an ubiquitin E3 ligase. However, in the presence of SUMO chains, RNF4 is activated by dimerization, leading to both substrate ubiquitylation and autoubiquitylation, responsible for degradation of RNF4. Thus the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of RNF4 is directly linked to the availability of its polySUMO substrates.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in p53 and RAS potently cooperate in oncogenic transformation, and correspondingly, these genetic alterations frequently coexist in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) and other human cancers. Previously, we identified a set of genes synergistically activated by combined RAS and p53 mutations as frequent downstream mediators of tumorigenesis. Here, we show that the synergistically activated gene Plac8 is critical for pancreatic cancer growth. Silencing of Plac8 in cell lines suppresses tumor formation by blocking autophagy, a process essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis in PDA, and genetic inactivation in an engineered mouse model inhibits PDA progression. We show that Plac8 is a critical regulator of the autophagic machinery, localizing to the lysosomal compartment and facilitating lysosome-autophagosome fusion. Plac8 thus provides a mechanistic link between primary oncogenic mutations and the induction of autophagy, a central mechanism of metabolic reprogramming, during PDA progression.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian cells generate citrate by decarboxylating pyruvate in the mitochondria to supply the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In contrast, hypoxia and other impairments of mitochondrial function induce an alternative pathway that produces citrate by reductively carboxylating α-ketoglutarate (AKG) via NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). It is unknown how cells generate reducing equivalents necessary to supply reductive carboxylation in the setting of mitochondrial impairment. Here, we identified shared metabolic features in cells using reductive carboxylation. Paradoxically, reductive carboxylation was accompanied by concomitant AKG oxidation in the TCA cycle. Inhibiting AKG oxidation decreased reducing equivalent availability and suppressed reductive carboxylation. Interrupting transfer of reducing equivalents from NADH to NADPH by nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase increased NADH abundance and decreased NADPH abundance while suppressing reductive carboxylation. The data demonstrate that reductive carboxylation requires bidirectional AKG metabolism along oxidative and reductive pathways, with the oxidative pathway producing reducing equivalents used to operate IDH in reverse.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to interconvert terminally differentiated cells could serve as a powerful tool for cell-based treatment of degenerative diseases, including diabetes mellitus. To determine which, if any, adult tissues are competent to activate an islet β cell program, we performed an in vivo screen by expressing three β cell “reprogramming factors” in a wide spectrum of tissues. We report that transient intestinal expression of these factors—Pdx1, MafA, and Ngn3 (PMN)—promotes rapid conversion of intestinal crypt cells into endocrine cells, which coalesce into “neoislets” below the crypt base. Neoislet cells express insulin and show ultrastructural features of β cells. Importantly, intestinal neoislets are glucose-responsive and able to ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. Moreover, PMN expression in human intestinal “organoids” stimulates the conversion of intestinal epithelial cells into β-like cells. Our results thus demonstrate that the intestine is an accessible and abundant source of functional insulin-producing cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cooperative dependencies between mutant oncoproteins and wild-type proteins are critical in cancer pathogenesis and therapy resistance. Although spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) has been implicated in hematologic malignancies, it is rarely mutated. We used kinase activity profiling to identify collaborators of SYK in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determined that FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is transactivated by SYK via direct binding. Highly activated SYK is predominantly found in FLT3-ITD positive AML and cooperates with FLT3-ITD to activate MYC transcriptional programs. FLT3-ITD AML cells are more vulnerable to SYK suppression than FLT3 wild-type counterparts. In a FLT3-ITD in vivo model, SYK is indispensable for myeloproliferative disease (MPD) development, and SYK overexpression promotes overt transformation to AML and resistance to FLT3-ITD-targeted therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) modulates angiogenesis by binding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, VEGFR2. We examined the consequences when VEGFR2 and NRP1 were expressed on the same cell (cis) or on different cells (trans). In cis, VEGF induced rapid VEGFR2/NRP1 complex formation and internalization. In trans, complex formation was delayed and phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and extracellular regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) was prolonged, whereas ERK1 phosphorylation was reduced. Trans complex formation suppressed initiation and vascularization of NRP1-expressing mouse fibrosarcoma and melanoma. Suppression in trans required high-affinity, steady-state binding of VEGF to NRP1, which was dependent on the NRP1 C-terminal domain. Compatible with a trans effect of NRP1, quiescent vasculature in the developing retina showed continuous high NRP1 expression, whereas angiogenic sprouting occurred where NRP1 levels fluctuated between adjacent endothelial cells. Therefore, through communication in trans, NRP1 can modulate VEGFR2 signaling and suppress angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
RNAi is widely appreciated as a powerful regulator of mRNA translation in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. However, the presence and activity of RNAi factors in the mammalian nucleus has been the subject of considerable debate. Here, we show that Argonaute-2 (Ago2) and RNAi factors Dicer, TRBP, and TRNC6A/GW182 are in the human nucleus and associate together in multiprotein complexes. Small RNAs can silence nuclear RNA and guide site-specific cleavage of the targeted RNA, demonstrating that RNAi can function in the human nucleus. Nuclear Dicer is active and miRNAs are bound to nuclear Ago2, consistent with the existence of nuclear miRNA pathways. Notably, we do not detect loading of duplex small RNAs in nuclear extracts and known loading factors are absent. These results extend RNAi into the mammalian nucleus and suggest that regulation of RNAi via small RNA loading of Ago2 differs between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
CD95 (Fas/APO-1), when bound by its cognate ligand CD95L, induces cells to die by apoptosis. We now show that elimination of CD95 or CD95L results in a form of cell death that is independent of caspase-8, RIPK1/MLKL, and p53, is not inhibited by Bcl-xL expression, and preferentially affects cancer cells. All tumors that formed in mouse models of low-grade serous ovarian cancer or chemically induced liver cancer with tissue-specific deletion of CD95 still expressed CD95, suggesting that cancer cannot form in the absence of CD95. Death induced by CD95R/L elimination (DICE) is characterized by an increase in cell size, production of mitochondrial ROS, and DNA damage. It resembles a necrotic form of mitotic catastrophe. No single drug was found to completely block this form of cell death, and it could also not be blocked by the knockdown of a single gene, making it a promising way to kill cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Pdx1 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor that plays a key role in pancreatic development and adult β cell function. In this study, we traced the fate of adult β cells after Pdx1 deletion. As expected, β-cell-specific removal of Pdx1 resulted in severe hyperglycemia within days. Surprisingly, a large fraction of Pdx1-deleted cells rapidly acquired ultrastructural and physiological features of α cells, indicating that a robust cellular reprogramming had occurred. Reprogrammed cells exhibited a global transcriptional shift that included derepression of the α cell transcription factor MafB, resulting in a transcriptional profile that closely resembled that of α cells. These findings indicate that Pdx1 acts as a master regulator of β cell fate by simultaneously activating genes essential for β cell identity and repressing those associated with α cell identity. We discuss the significance of these findings in the context of the emerging notion that loss of β cell identity contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to establish a recipient model for spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) transplantation in the Kunming mice after different doses busulfan treatment. The results showed that the most optimal dose of busulfan was 20mg/kg and the most appropriate time for transplantation was 5–7wk after busulfan treatment. Then, the cloned fragments existed in the testis of recipient mice after 20mg/kg busulfan treatment and the offspring with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were produced by the transplanting SSCs. Hence, we established the effective recipient model for donor-derived SSCs transplantation in Kunming mice.

Abstract: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play an important role in impairing the function of T cells. We characterized MDSCs in two chronic hepatitis C (CHC) cohorts: a cross-sectional group that included 61 treatment-naive patients with CHC, 14 rapid virologic response (RVR) cases and 22 early virologic response (EVR) cases; and a longitudinal group of 13 cases of RVR and 10 cases of EVR after pegylated-interferon-α/ribavirin treatment for genotype 1b HCV infection. Liver samples from 32 CHC patients and six healthy controls were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. MDSCs frequency in treatment-naive CHC was significantly higher than in RVR, EVR, or healthy subjects and was positively correlated with HCV RNA. Patients infected with HCV genotype 2a had a significantly higher frequency of MDSCs than those infected with genotype 1b. Decreased T cell receptor (TCR) ζ expression on CD8+ T cells was significantly associated with an increased frequency of MDSCs in treatment-naive CHC patients and was restored by L-arginine treatment in vitro. Increased numbers of liver arginase-1+ cells were closely associated with the histological activity index in CHC. The TCR ζ chain was significantly downregulated on hepatic CD8+ T cells in CHC. During antiviral follow up, MDSCs frequency in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was directly correlated with the HCV RNA load in the plasma and inversely correlated with TCR ζ chain expression in CD8+ T cells in both RVR and EVR cases. Notably, the RVR group had a higher frequency of MDSCs at baseline than the EVR group. Collectively, this study provides evidence that MDSCs might be associated with HCV persistence and downregulation of CD8 ζ chain expression.

Abstract: Summary
The small G protein family Rac has numerous regulators that integrate extracellular signals into tight spatiotemporal maps of its activity to promote specific cell morphologies and responses. Here, we have generated a mouse strain, Rac-FRET, which ubiquitously expresses the Raichu-Rac biosensor. It enables FRET imaging and quantification of Rac activity in live tissues and primary cells without affecting cell properties and responses. We assessed Rac activity in chemotaxing Rac-FRET neutrophils and found enrichment in leading-edge protrusions and unexpected longitudinal shifts and oscillations during protruding and stalling phases of migration. We monitored Rac activity in normal or disease states of intestinal, liver, mammary, pancreatic, and skin tissue, in response to stimulation or inhibition and upon genetic manipulation of upstream regulators, revealing unexpected insights into Rac signaling during disease development. The Rac-FRET strain is a resource that promises to fundamentally advance our understanding of Rac-dependent responses in primary cells and native environments.

Abstract: Summary
Lineage-committed cells of many tissues exhibit substantial plasticity in contexts such as wound healing and tumorigenesis, but the regulation of this process is not well understood. We identified the Hippo transducer WWTR1/TAZ in a screen of transcription factors that are able to prompt lineage switching of mammary epithelial cells. Forced expression of TAZ in luminal cells induces them to adopt basal characteristics, and depletion of TAZ in basal and/or myoepithelial cells leads to luminal differentiation. In human and mouse tissues, TAZ is active only in basal cells and is critical for basal cell maintenance during homeostasis. Accordingly, loss of TAZ affects mammary gland development, leading to an imbalance of luminal and basal populations as well as branching defects. Mechanistically, TAZ interacts with components of the SWI/SNF complex to modulate lineage-specific gene expression. Collectively, these findings uncover a new role for Hippo signaling in the determination of lineage identity through recruitment of chromatin-remodeling complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Current antiangiogenic therapy is limited by its cytostatic nature and systemic side effects. To address these limitations, we have unveiled the role of RhoJ, an endothelial-enriched Rho GTPase, during tumor progression. RhoJ blockade provides a double assault on tumor vessels by both inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and disrupting the preformed tumor vessels through the activation of the RhoA-ROCK (Rho kinase) signaling pathway in tumor endothelial cells, consequently resulting in a functional failure of tumor vasculatures. Moreover, enhanced anticancer effects were observed when RhoJ blockade was employed in concert with a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent, angiogenesis-inhibiting agent, or vascular-disrupting agent. These results identify RhoJ blockade as a selective and effective therapeutic strategy for targeting tumor vasculature with minimal side effects.

Abstract: Summary
In lung cancer progression, p53 mutations are more often observed in invasive tumors than in noninvasive tumors, suggesting that p53 is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. To understand the nature of p53 function as a tumor suppressor, it is crucial to elucidate the detailed mechanism of the alteration in epithelial cells that follow oncogenic KRAS activation and p53 inactivation. Here, we report that KRAS activation induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and that p53 inactivation is required for cell motility and invasiveness. Furthermore, TSPAN2, a transmembrane protein, is responsible for cell motility and invasiveness elicited by p53 inactivation. TSPAN2 is highly expressed in p53-mutated lung cancer cells, and high expression of TSPAN2 is associated with the poor prognosis of lung adenocarinomas. TSPAN2 knockdown suppresses metastasis to the lungs and liver, enabling prolonged survival. TSPAN2 enhances cell motility and invasiveness by assisting CD44 in scavenging intracellular reactive oxygen species.

Abstract: Summary
Random autosomal monoallelic gene expression refers to the transcription of a gene from one of two homologous alleles. We assessed the dynamics of monoallelic expression during development through an allele-specific RNA-sequencing screen in clonal populations of hybrid mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs). We identified 67 and 376 inheritable autosomal random monoallelically expressed genes in ESCs and NPCs, respectively, a 5.6-fold increase upon differentiation. Although DNA methylation and nuclear positioning did not distinguish the active and inactive alleles, specific histone modifications were differentially enriched between the two alleles. Interestingly, expression levels of 8% of the monoallelically expressed genes remained similar between monoallelic and biallelic clones. These results support a model in which random monoallelic expression occurs stochastically during differentiation and, for some genes, is compensated for by the cell to maintain the required transcriptional output of these genes.

Abstract: Degeneration of intervertebral disk (IVD) has been increased in recent years. The lumbar herniation can be cured using conservative and surgical procedures. Surgery is considered after failure of conservative treatment. Partial discectomy, fusion, and total disk replacement (TDR) are also common surgical treatments for degenerative disk disease. However, due to limitations and disadvantages of the current treatments, many studies have been carried out to approach the best design of mimicking natural disk. Recently, a new method of TDRs has been introduced using nature deformation of IVD by reinforced fibers of annulus fibrosis. Nonetheless, owing to limitations of experimental works on the human body, numerical studies of IVD may help to understand load transfer and biomechanical properties within the disks with reinforced fibers. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model of the L2-L3 disk vertebrae unit with 12 vertical fibers embedded into annulus fibrosis was constructed. The IVD was subjected to compressive force, bending moment, and axial torsion. The most important parameters of disk failures were compared to that of experimental data. The results showed that the addition of reinforced fibers into the disk invokes a significant decrease of stress in the nucleus and annulus. The findings of this study may have implications not only for developing IVDs with reinforced fibers but also for the application of fiber reinforced IVD in orthopedics surgeries as a suitable implant.

Abstract: Summary
Orexin neuropeptides promote arousal, appetite, reward, and energy expenditure. However, whether orexin affects bone mass accrual is unknown. Here, we show that orexin functions centrally through orexin receptor 2 (OX2R) in the brain to enhance bone formation. OX2R null mice exhibit low bone mass owing to elevated circulating leptin, whereas central administration of an OX2R-selective agonist augments bone mass. Conversely, orexin also functions peripherally through orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) in the bone to suppress bone formation. OX1R null mice exhibit high bone mass owing to a differentiation shift from marrow adipocyte to osteoblast that results from higher osseous ghrelin expression. The central action is dominant because bone mass is reduced in orexin null and OX1R2R double null mice but enhanced in orexin-overexpressing transgenic mice. These findings reveal orexin as a critical rheostat of skeletal homeostasis that exerts a yin-yang dual regulation and highlight orexin as a therapeutic target for osteoporosis.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin resistance is a major cause of diabetes and is highly associated with adipose tissue (AT) inflammation in obesity. RBP4, a retinol transporter, is elevated in insulin resistance and contributes to increased diabetes risk. We aimed to determine the mechanisms for RBP4-induced insulin resistance. Here we show that RBP4 elevation causes AT inflammation by activating innate immunity that elicits an adaptive immune response. RBP4-overexpressing mice (RBP4-Ox) are insulin resistant and glucose intolerant and have increased AT macrophage and CD4 T cell infiltration. In RBP4-Ox, AT CD206+ macrophages express proinflammatory markers and activate CD4 T cells while maintaining alternatively activated macrophage markers. These effects result from direct activation of AT antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by RBP4 through a JNK-dependent pathway. Transfer of RBP4-activated APCs into normal mice is sufficient to induce AT inflammation, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Thus, RBP4 causes insulin resistance, at least partly, by activating AT APCs that induce CD4 T cell Th1 polarization and AT inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Hemozoin (Hz) is the crystalline detoxification product of hemoglobin in Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes. We previously proposed that Hz can carry plasmodial DNA into a subcellular compartment that is accessible to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), inducing an inflammatory signal. Hz also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in primed cells. We found that Hz appears to colocalize with DNA in infected erythrocytes, even before RBC rupture or phagolysosomal digestion. Using synthetic Hz coated in vitro with plasmodial genomic DNA (gDNA) or CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, we observed that DNA-complexed Hz induced TLR9 translocation, providing a priming and an activation signal for inflammasomes. After phagocytosis, Hz and DNA dissociate. Hz subsequently induces phagolysosomal destabilization, allowing phagolysosomal contents access to the cytosol, where DNA receptors become activated. Similar observations were made with Plasmodium-infected RBCs. Finally, infected erythrocytes activated both the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes. These observations suggest that Hz and DNA work together to induce systemic inflammation during malaria.

Abstract: Summary
Copper is an essential yet toxic metal and its overload causes Wilson disease, a disorder due to mutations in copper transporter ATP7B. To remove excess copper into the bile, ATP7B traffics toward canalicular area of hepatocytes. However, the trafficking mechanisms of ATP7B remain elusive. Here, we show that, in response to elevated copper, ATP7B moves from the Golgi to lysosomes and imports metal into their lumen. ATP7B enables lysosomes to undergo exocytosis through the interaction with p62 subunit of dynactin that allows lysosome translocation toward the canalicular pole of hepatocytes. Activation of lysosomal exocytosis stimulates copper clearance from the hepatocytes and rescues the most frequent Wilson-disease-causing ATP7B mutant to the appropriate functional site. Our findings indicate that lysosomes serve as an important intermediate in ATP7B trafficking, whereas lysosomal exocytosis operates as an integral process in copper excretion and hence can be targeted for therapeutic approaches to combat Wilson disease.

Abstract: Summary
Tudor domain-containing protein 3 (TDRD3) is a major methylarginine effector molecule that reads methyl-histone marks and facilitates gene transcription. However, the underlying mechanism by which TDRD3 functions as a transcriptional coactivator is unknown. We identified topoisomerase IIIB (TOP3B) as a component of the TDRD3 complex. TDRD3 serves as a molecular bridge between TOP3B and arginine-methylated histones. The TDRD3-TOP3B complex is recruited to the c-MYC gene promoter primarily by the H4R3me2a mark, and the complex promotes c-MYC gene expression. TOP3B relaxes negative supercoiled DNA and reduces transcription-generated R loops in vitro. TDRD3 knockdown in cells increases R loop formation at the c-MYC locus, and Tdrd3 null mice exhibit elevated R loop formation at this locus in B cells. Tdrd3 null mice show significantly increased c-Myc/Igh translocation, a process driven by R loop structures. By reducing negative supercoiling and resolving R loops, TOP3B promotes transcription, protects against DNA damage, and reduces the frequency of chromosomal translocations.

Abstract: Summary
In Arabidopsis, multisubunit RNA polymerases IV and V orchestrate RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and transcriptional silencing, but what identifies the loci to be silenced is unclear. We show that heritable silent locus identity at a specific subset of RdDM targets requires HISTONE DEACETYLASE 6 (HDA6) acting upstream of Pol IV recruitment and siRNA biogenesis. At these loci, epigenetic memory conferring silent locus identity is erased in hda6 mutants such that restoration of HDA6 activity cannot restore siRNA biogenesis or silencing. Silent locus identity is similarly lost in mutants for the cytosine maintenance methyltransferase, MET1. By contrast, pol IV or pol V mutants disrupt silencing without erasing silent locus identity, allowing restoration of Pol IV or Pol V function to restore silencing. Collectively, these observations indicate that silent locus specification and silencing are separable steps that together account for epigenetic inheritance of the silenced state.

Parvalbumin as a metal-dependent antioxidant,

Abstract: Parvalbumin (PA) is a Ca2+-binding protein of vertebrates massively expressed in tissues with high oxygen uptake and respectively elevated level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To characterize antioxidant properties of PA, antioxidant capacity (AOC) of intact rat α-PA has been explored. ORAC, TEAC and hydrogen peroxide AOC assays evidence conformation-dependent oxidation of the PA. AOC value for the apo-PA 4-11-fold exceeds that for the Ca2+-loaded protein. Despite folded conformation of apo-PA, it has AOC equivalent to that of the proteolized protein. The most populated under resting conditions PA form, Mg2+-bound PA, has AOC similar to that of apo-PA. ROS-induced changes in absorption spectrum of PA evidence an oxidation of PA's phenylalanines in the ORAC assay. Sensitivity of PA oxidation to its conformation enabled characterization of its metal affinity and pH-dependent behavior: a transition with pKa of 7.6 has been revealed for the Ca2+-loaded PA. Since total AOC of PA under in vivo conditions may reach the level of reduced glutathione, we propose that PA might modulate intracellular redox equilibria and/or signaling in a calcium-dependent manner. We speculate that the oxidation-mediated damage of some of PA-GABAergic interneurons observed in schizophrenia is due to a decline in total AOC of the reduced glutathione–PA pair.

IKKα Promotes Intestinal Tumorigenesis by Limiting Recruitment of M1-like Polarized Myeloid Cells,

Abstract: Summary
The recruitment of immune cells into solid tumors is an essential prerequisite of tumor development. Depending on the prevailing polarization profile of these infiltrating leucocytes, tumorigenesis is either promoted or blocked. Here, we identify IκB kinase α (IKKα) as a central regulator of a tumoricidal microenvironment during intestinal carcinogenesis. Mice deficient in IKKα kinase activity are largely protected from intestinal tumor development that is dependent on the enhanced recruitment of interferon γ (IFNγ)-expressing M1-like myeloid cells. In IKKα mutant mice, M1-like polarization is not controlled in a cell-autonomous manner but, rather, depends on the interplay of both IKKα mutant tumor epithelia and immune cells. Because therapies aiming at the tumor microenvironment rather than directly at the mutated cancer cell may circumvent resistance development, we suggest IKKα as a promising target for colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy.

Ubiquitin Ligase Trapping Identifies an SCFSaf1 Pathway Targeting Unprocessed Vacuolar/Lysosomal Proteins,

Abstract: Summary
We have developed a technique, called Ubiquitin Ligase Substrate Trapping, for the isolation of ubiquitinated substrates in complex with their ubiquitin ligase (E3). By fusing a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain to an E3 ligase, we were able to selectively purify the polyubiquitinated forms of E3 substrates. Using ligase traps of eight different F box proteins (SCF specificity factors) coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified known, as well as previously unreported, substrates. Polyubiquitinated forms of candidate substrates associated with their cognate F box partner, but not other ligase traps. Interestingly, the four most abundant candidate substrates identified for the F box protein Saf1 were all vacuolar/lysosomal proteins. Analysis of one of these substrates, Prb1, showed that Saf1 selectively promotes ubiquitination of the unprocessed form of the zymogen. This suggests that Saf1 is part of a pathway that targets protein precursors for proteasomal degradation.

TFIIH Phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD Stimulates Mediator Dissociation from the Preinitiation Complex and Promoter Escape,

Abstract: Summary
The transition between transcriptional initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II is associated with phosphorylation of its C-terminal tail (CTD). Depletion of Kin28, the TFIIH subunit that phosphorylates the CTD, does not affect elongation but causes Pol II occupancy profiles to shift upstream in a FACT-independent manner indicative of a defect in promoter escape. Stronger defects in promoter escape are linked to stronger effects on preinitiation complex formation and transcription, suggesting that impairment in promoter escape results in premature dissociation of general factors and Pol II near the promoter. Kin28 has a stronger effect on genes whose transcription is dependent on SAGA as opposed to TFIID. Strikingly, Kin28 depletion causes a dramatic increase in Mediator at the core promoter. These observations suggest that TFIIH phosphorylation of the CTD causes Mediator dissociation, thereby permitting rapid promoter escape of Pol II from the preinitiation complex.

Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 3 Is an Oxygen-Dependent Transcription Activator and Regulates a Distinct Transcriptional Response to Hypoxia,

Abstract: Summary
Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play key roles in the cellular response to hypoxia. It is widely accepted that whereas HIF-1 and HIF-2 function as transcriptional activators, HIF-3 inhibits HIF-1/2α action. Contrary to this idea, we show that zebrafish Hif-3α has strong transactivation activity. Hif-3α is degraded under normoxia. Mutation of P393, P493, and L503 inhibits this oxygen-dependent degradation. Transcriptomics and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses identify genes that are regulated by Hif-3α, Hif-1α, or both. Under hypoxia or when overexpressed, Hif-3α binds to its target gene promoters and upregulates their expression. Dominant-negative inhibition and knockdown of Hif-3α abolish hypoxia-induced Hif-3α-promoter binding and gene expression. Hif-3α not only mediates hypoxia-induced growth and developmental retardation but also possesses hypoxia-independent activities. Importantly, transactivation activity is conserved and human HIF-3α upregulates similar genes in human cells. These findings suggest that Hif-3 is an oxygen-dependent transcription factor and activates a distinct transcriptional response to hypoxia.
