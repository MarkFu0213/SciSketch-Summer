Abstract: Summary
The relationship between dendritic cells (DCs) and commensal microflora in shaping systemic immune responses is not well understood. Here, we report that mice deficient for the Fas-associated death domain in DCs developed systemic inflammation associated with elevated proinflammatory cytokines and increased myeloid and B cells. These mice exhibited reduced DCs in gut-associated lymphoid tissues due to RIP3-dependent necroptosis, whereas DC functions remained intact. Induction of systemic inflammation required DC necroptosis and commensal microbiota signals that activated MyD88-dependent pathways in other cell types. Systemic inflammation was abrogated with the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics or complete, but not DC-specific, deletion of MyD88. Thus, we have identified a previously unappreciated role for commensal microbiota in priming immune cells for inflammatory responses against necrotic cells. These studies demonstrate the impact intestinal microflora have on the immune system and their role in eliciting proper immune responses to harmful stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
E2F/DP transcription factors regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here, we investigated the mechanism of the resistance of Drosophila dDP mutants to irradiation-induced apoptosis. Contrary to the prevailing view, this is not due to an inability to induce the apoptotic transcriptional program, because we show that this program is induced; rather, this is due to a mitochondrial dysfunction of dDP mutants. We attribute this defect to E2F/DP-dependent control of expression of mitochondria-associated genes. Genetic attenuation of several of these E2F/DP targets mimics the dDP mutant mitochondrial phenotype and protects against irradiation-induced apoptosis. Significantly, the role of E2F/DP in the regulation of mitochondrial function is conserved between flies and humans. Thus, our results uncover a role of E2F/DP in the regulation of mitochondrial function and demonstrate that this aspect of E2F regulation is critical for the normal induction of apoptosis in response to irradiation.

Abstract: Summary
Recombinational repair of spontaneous double-strand breaks (DSBs) exhibits sister bias. DSB-initiated meiotic recombination exhibits homolog bias. Physical analysis in yeast reveals that, in both cases, the recombination reaction intrinsically gives homolog bias. From this baseline default, cohesin intervenes to confer sister bias, likely independent of cohesion. In meiosis, cohesin’s sister-biasing effect is counteracted by RecA homolog Rad51 and its mediators, plus meiotic RecA homolog Dmc1, which thereby restore intrinsic homolog bias. Meiotic axis complex Red1/Mek1/Hop1 participates by cleanly switching recombination from mitotic to meiotic mode, concomitantly activating Dmc1. We propose that a Rad51/DNA filament at one DSB end captures the intact sister, creating an anchor pad. This filament extends across the DSB site on the intact partner, precluding intersister strand exchange, thus forcing use of the homolog. Cohesin and Dmc1 interactively modulate this extension, with program-appropriate effects. In accord with this model, Rad51-mediated recombination in vivo requires the presence of a sister.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is thought to be driven by a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that self-renew and recapitulate tumor heterogeneity yet remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comparative analysis of chromatin state in GBM CSCs that reveals widespread activation of genes normally held in check by Polycomb repressors. These activated targets include a large set of developmental transcription factors (TFs) whose coordinated activation is unique to the CSCs. We demonstrate that a critical factor in the set, ASCL1, activates Wnt signaling by repressing the negative regulator DKK1. We show that ASCL1 is essential for the maintenance and in vivo tumorigenicity of GBM CSCs. Genome-wide binding profiles for ASCL1 and the Wnt effector LEF-1 provide mechanistic insight and suggest widespread interactions between the TF module and the signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate regulatory connections among ASCL1, Wnt signaling, and collaborating TFs that are essential for the maintenance and tumorigenicity of GBM CSCs.

Abstract: Interleukin 23 (IL-23) is an inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in tumor promotion. Expression of IL-23 is increased in cancer cells and correlates with tumor progression. However, the mechanisms regulating IL-23 expression in cancer cells are still unclear. Here we report that tristetraprolin (TTP), an AU-rich element (ARE)-binding protein, inhibits IL-23 production in CT26 mouse colon cancer cells. Overexpression of TTP decreased the stability of IL-23 mRNA and the expression level of IL-23 in CT26 cells. Conversely, inhibition of TTP by siRNA increased IL- 23 production. TTP destabilized a luciferase mRNA reporter containing the IL-23 mRNA 3'UTR, which contains five AREs. Analyses of deletion and point mutants of the IL-23 mRNA 3'UTR demonstrated that the ARE cluster between the third and fifth AREs was responsible for TTP-mediated destabilization of IL-23 mRNA. A RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that TTP binds to this ARE cluster. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TTP acts as a negative regulator of IL-23 gene expression in mouse colon cancer cells and suggest its potential application as a novel therapeutic target to control IL-23- mediated tumor promotion.

Abstract: Summary
Reversible posttranslational modifications are emerging as critical regulators of mitochondrial proteins and metabolism. Here, we use a label-free quantitative proteomic approach to characterize the lysine succinylome in liver mitochondria and its regulation by the desuccinylase SIRT5. A total of 1,190 unique sites were identified as succinylated, and 386 sites across 140 proteins representing several metabolic pathways including β-oxidation and ketogenesis were significantly hypersuccinylated in Sirt5−/− animals. Loss of SIRT5 leads to accumulation of medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines and decreased β-hydroxybutyrate production in vivo. In addition, we demonstrate that SIRT5 regulates succinylation of the rate-limiting ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) both in vivo and in vitro. Finally, mutation of hypersuccinylated residues K83 and K310 on HMGCS2 to glutamic acid strongly inhibits enzymatic activity. Taken together, these findings establish SIRT5 as a global regulator of lysine succinylation in mitochondria and present a mechanism for inhibition of ketogenesis through HMGCS2.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes appear to share similar pathogenic mechanisms. dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) underlies peripheral insulin resistance in metabolic disorders. PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α-P), and AD brains exhibit elevated phospho-PKR and eIF2α-P levels. Whether and how PKR and eIF2α-P participate in defective brain insulin signaling and cognitive impairment in AD are unknown. We report that β-amyloid oligomers, AD-associated toxins, activate PKR in a tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-dependent manner, resulting in eIF2α-P, neuronal insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) inhibition, synapse loss, and memory impairment. Brain phospho-PKR and eIF2α-P were elevated in AD animal models, including monkeys given intracerebroventricular oligomer infusions. Oligomers failed to trigger eIF2α-P and cognitive impairment in PKR−/− and TNFR1−/− mice. Bolstering insulin signaling rescued phospho-PKR and eIF2α-P. Results reveal pathogenic mechanisms shared by AD and diabetes and establish that proinflammatory signaling mediates oligomer-induced IRS-1 inhibition and PKR-dependent synapse and memory loss.

Abstract: Extracellular immune responses to ascomycete and oomycete pathogens in Arabidopsis are dependent on vesicle-associated secretion mediated by the SNARE proteins PEN1 syntaxin, SNAP33 and endomembrane-resident VAMP721/722. Continuous movement of functional GFP-VAMP722 to and from the plasma membrane in nonstimulated cells reflects the second proposed function of VAMP721/722 in constitutive secretion during plant growth and development. Application of the bacterium-derived elicitor flg22 stabilizes VAMP721/722 that are otherwise constitutively degraded via the 26S proteasome pathway. Depletion of VAMP721/722 levels by reducing VAMP721/ 722 gene dosage enhances flg22-induced seedling growth inhibition in spite of elevated VAMP721/722 abundance. We therefore propose that plants prioritize the deployment of the corresponding secretory pathway for defense over plant growth. Interstingly, VAMP721/722 specifically interact in vitro and in vivo with the plasma membrane syntaxin SYP132 that is required for plant growth and resistance to bacteria. This suggests that the plant growth/immunity-involved VAMP721/722 form SNARE complexes with multiple plasma membrane syntaxins to discharge cuedependent cargo molecules.

Abstract: Summary
Increased visceral fat is associated with a high risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome and is in part caused by excessive glucocorticoids (GCs). However, the molecular mechanisms remain undefined. We now identify the GC-dependent gene LIM domain only 3 (LMO3) as being selectively upregulated in a depot-specific manner in human obese visceral adipose tissue, localizing primarily in the adipocyte fraction. Visceral LMO3 levels were tightly correlated with expression of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 (HSD11B1), the enzyme responsible for local activation of GCs. In early human adipose stromal cell differentiation, GCs induced LMO3 via the GC receptor and a positive feedback mechanism involving 11βHSD1. No such induction was observed in murine adipogenesis. LMO3 overexpression promoted, while silencing of LMO3 suppressed, adipogenesis via regulation of the proadipogenic PPARγ axis. These results establish LMO3 as a regulator of human adipogenesis and could contribute a mechanism resulting in visceral-fat accumulation in obesity due to excess glucocorticoids.

Abstract: The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in cell shape determination, adhesion and cell cycle progression. Ezrin- radixin-moesin (ERM)-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), also known as Na+-H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1), associates with actin cytoskeleton and is related to cell cycle progression. Its Ser279 and Ser301 residues are phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdc2)/cyclin B during the mitosis phase. However, the biological significance of EBP50 phosphorylation mediated by cdc2/cyclin B is not clear. In the present study, MDA-MB-231 cells with low levels of endogenous EBP50 protein were stably transfected with constructs of EBP50 wild type (WT), phosphodeficient (serine 279 and serine 301 mutated to alanine- S279A/S301A) or phospho-mimetic (serine 279 and serine 301 mutated to aspartic acid-S279D/S301D) mutants. Subsequently, multiple phenotypes of these cells were characterized. Failure of cdc2/cyclin B-mediated EBP50 phosphorylation in cells expressing S279A/S301A (AA cells) significantly increased F-actin content, enhanced the adherence of cells to the extracellular matrix, altered cell morphology and caused defects in cytokinesis, as reflected in the formation of giant cells with heteroploid DNA and multinucleation or giant nuclei. Furthermore, knockdown of EBP50 expression in AA cells rescued cell defects such as the cytokinesis failure and abnormal cell morphology. EBP50 S279A/ S301A had a weaker binding affinity with actin than EBP50 S279D/S301D, which might explain the increase of F-actin content in the AA cells. The present results suggest that cdc2/cyclin B-mediated EBP50 phosphorylation may play a role in the regulation of various cell functions by affecting actin cytoskeleton reorganization.

Abstract: Summary
The piRNA (PIWI-interacting RNA) pathway is a small RNA silencing system that acts in animal gonads and protects the genome against the deleterious influence of transposons. A major bottleneck in the field is the lack of comprehensive knowledge of the factors and molecular processes that constitute this pathway. We conducted an RNAi screen in Drosophila and identified ∼50 genes that strongly impact the ovarian somatic piRNA pathway. Many identified genes fall into functional categories that indicate essential roles for mitochondrial metabolism, RNA export, the nuclear pore, transcription elongation, and chromatin regulation in the pathway. Follow-up studies on two factors demonstrate that components acting at distinct hierarchical levels of the pathway were identified. Finally, we define CG2183/Gasz as an essential primary piRNA biogenesis factor in somatic and germline cells. Based on the similarities between insect and vertebrate piRNA pathways, our results have far-reaching implications for the understanding of this conserved genome defense system.

Abstract: Summary
Monosomy 7 and interstitial deletion of 7q (−7/7q−) are well-recognized nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities frequently found among patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and myeloid leukemias. We previously identified candidate myeloid tumor suppressor genes (SAMD9, SAMD9-like = SAMD9L, and Miki) in the 7q21.3 subband. We established SAMD9L-deficient mice and found that SAMD9L+/− mice as well as SAMD9L−/− mice develop myeloid diseases resembling human diseases associated with −7/7q−. SAMD9L-deficient hematopoietic stem cells showed enhanced colony formation potential and in vivo reconstitution ability. SAMD9L localizes in early endosomes. SAMD9L-deficient cells showed delays in homotypic endosome fusion, resulting in persistence of ligand-bound cytokine receptors. These findings suggest that haploinsufficiency of SAMD9L and/or SAMD9 gene(s) contributes to myeloid transformation.

Abstract: Chondrogenesis is known to be regulated by calcium-dependent signalling pathways in which temporal aspects of calcium homeostasis are of key importance. We aimed to better characterise calcium influx and release functions with respect to rapid calcium oscillations in cells of chondrifying chicken high density cultures. We found that differentiating chondrocytes express the α1 subunit of voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) at both mRNA and protein levels, and that these ion channels play important roles in generating Ca2+ influx for oscillations as nifedipine interfered with repetitive calcium transients. Furthermore, VOCC blockade abrogated chondrogenesis and almost completely blocked cell proliferation. The contribution of internal Ca2+ stores via store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) seems to be indispensable to both Ca2+ oscillations and chondrogenesis. Moreover, this is the first study to show the functional expression of STIM1/STIM2 and Orai1, molecules that orchestrate SOCE, in chondrogenic cells. Inhibition of SOCE combined with ER calcium store depletion abolished differentiation and severely diminished proliferation, suggesting the important role of internal pools in calcium homeostasis of differentiating chondrocytes. Finally, we present an integrated model for the regulation of calcium oscillations of differentiating chondrocytes that may have important implications for studies of chondrogenesis induced in various stem cell populations.

Abstract: Summary
Successful chemotaxis requires not only increased motility but also sustained directionality. Here, we show that, during neutrophil chemotaxis via receptors coupled with the Gi family of heterotrimeric G proteins, directional movement is regulated by mInsc, a mammalian protein distantly related to the Drosophila polarity-organizer Inscuteable. The GDP-bound, Gβγ-free Gαi subunit accumulates at the front of chemotaxing neutrophils to recruit mInsc—complexed with the Par3-aPKC evolutionarily conserved polarity complex—via LGN/AGS3 that simultaneously binds to Gαi-GDP and mInsc. Both mInsc-deficient and aPKC-blocked neutrophils exhibit a normal motile activity but migrate in an undirected manner. mInsc deficiency prevents neutrophils from efficiently stabilizing pseudopods at the leading edge; the stability is restored by wild-type mInsc, but not by a mutant protein defective in binding to LGN/AGS3. Thus, mInsc controls directional migration via noncanonical G protein signaling, in which Gβγ-free Gαi-GDP, a product from Gαi-GTP released after receptor activation, plays a central role.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiation of astrocytes from human stem cells has significant potential for analysis of their role in normal brain function and disease, but existing protocols generate only immature astrocytes. Using early neuralization, we generated spinal cord astrocytes from mouse or human embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells with high efficiency. Remarkably, short exposure to fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) or FGF2 was sufficient to direct these astrocytes selectively toward a mature quiescent phenotype, as judged by both marker expression and functional analysis. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1β, but not FGFs, induced multiple elements of a reactive inflammatory phenotype but did not affect maturation. These phenotypically defined, scalable populations of spinal cord astrocytes will be important both for studying normal astrocyte function and for modeling human pathological processes in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an increased susceptibility to squamous cell cancers. Fifteen FA genes are known, and the encoded proteins cooperate in a common DNA repair pathway. A critical step is the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein, and cells from most FA patients are deficient in this step. How monoubiquitinated FANCD2 suppresses squamous cell cancers is unknown. Here we show that Fancd2-deficient mice are prone to Ras-oncogene-driven skin carcinogenesis, while Usp1-deficient mice, expressing elevated cellular levels of Fancd2-Ub, are resistant to skin tumors. Moreover, Fancd2-Ub activates the transcription of the tumor suppressor TAp63, thereby promoting cellular senescence and blocking skin tumorigenesis. For FA patients, the reduction of FANCD2-Ub and TAp63 protein levels may account for their susceptibility to squamous cell neoplasia. Taken together, Usp1 inhibition may be a useful strategy for upregulating TAp63 and preventing or treating squamous cell cancers in the general non-FA population.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important developmental process hijacked by cancer cells for their dissemination. Here, we show that Exo70, a component of the exocyst complex, undergoes isoform switching mediated by ESRP1, a pre-mRNA splicing factor that regulates EMT. Expression of the epithelial isoform of Exo70 affects the levels of key EMT transcriptional regulators such as Snail and ZEB2 and is sufficient to drive the transition to epithelial phenotypes. Differential Exo70 isoform expression in human tumors correlates with cancer progression, and increased expression of the epithelial isoform of Exo70 inhibits tumor metastasis in mice. At the molecular level, the mesenchymal—but not the epithelial—isoform of Exo70 interacts with the Arp2/3 complex and stimulates actin polymerization for tumor invasion. Our findings provide a mechanism by which the exocyst function and actin dynamics are modulated for EMT and tumor invasion.

In the present study, we tested the biocompatibility of graphene films synthesized by chemical vapor deposition with electrogenic primary adult cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes) by measuring the cell properties such as cell attachment, survival, contractility and calcium transients. The results show that the graphene films showed stable cell attachment and excellent biocompatibility with the electrogenic cardiomyocytes, suggesting their useful applications for future cell biology studies.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous cytosolic and nuclear proteins involved in metabolism, DNA maintenance, protein translation, or iron homeostasis depend on iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cofactors, yet their assembly is poorly defined. Here, we identify and characterize human CIA2A (FAM96A), CIA2B (FAM96B), and CIA1 (CIAO1) as components of the cytosolic Fe/S protein assembly (CIA) machinery. CIA1 associates with either CIA2A or CIA2B and the CIA-targeting factor MMS19. The CIA2B-CIA1-MMS19 complex binds to and facilitates assembly of most cytosolic-nuclear Fe/S proteins. In contrast, CIA2A specifically matures iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), which is critical for cellular iron homeostasis. Surprisingly, a second layer of iron regulation involves the stabilization of IRP2 by CIA2A binding or upon depletion of CIA2B or MMS19, even though IRP2 lacks an Fe/S cluster. In summary, CIA2B-CIA1-MMS19 and CIA2A-CIA1 assist different branches of Fe/S protein assembly and intimately link this process to cellular iron regulation via IRP1 Fe/S cluster maturation and IRP2 stabilization.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormal activation of Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription is associated with a variety of human cancers. Here, we report that LATS2 inhibits oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription by disrupting the β-catenin/BCL9 interaction. LATS2 directly interacts with β-catenin and is present on Wnt target gene promoters. Mechanistically, LATS2 inhibits the interaction between BCL9 and β-catenin and subsequent recruitment of BCL9, independent of LATS2 kinase activity. LATS2 is downregulated and inversely correlated with the levels of Wnt target genes in human colorectal cancers. Moreover, nocodazole, an antimicrotubule drug, potently induces LATS2 to suppress tumor growth in vivo by targeting β-catenin/BCL9. Our results suggest that LATS2 is not only a key tumor suppressor in human cancer but may also be an important target for anticancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Nearly 90% of human melanomas contain inactivated wild-type p53, the underlying mechanisms for which are not fully understood. Here, we identify that cyclin B1/CDK1-phosphorylates iASPP, which leads to the inhibition of iASPP dimerization, promotion of iASPP monomer nuclear entry, and exposure of its p53 binding sites, leading to increased p53 inhibition. Nuclear iASPP is enriched in melanoma metastasis and associates with poor patient survival. Most wild-type p53-expressing melanoma cell lines coexpress high levels of phosphorylated nuclear iASPP, MDM2, and cyclin B1. Inhibition of MDM2 and iASPP phosphorylation with small molecules induced p53-dependent apoptosis and growth suppression. Concurrent p53 reactivation and BRAFV600E inhibition achieved additive suppression in vivo, presenting an alternative for melanoma therapy.

Abstract: Although cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a crucial role in seeding the initiation of tumor progression, they do not always possess the same potent ability as tumor metastasis. Thus, precisely how migrating CSCs occur, still remains unclear. In the present study, we first comparatively analyzed a series of prostate CSCs, which exhibited a dynamically increasing and disseminating ability in nude mice. We observed that the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α and β-catenin became gradually elevated in these stem cells and their epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristic altered from an epithelial type to a mesenchymal type. Next, we further used cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which were cultured from surgically resected tissues of prostate cancer (PCa) to stimulate prostate CSCs. Similar results were reconfirmed and showed that the protein levels of both HIF-1α and β-catenin were markedly improved. In addition, the EMT phenotype displayed a homogenous mesenchymal type, accompanied with increased aggressive potency in vitro. Most importantly, the aforementioned promoting effect of CAFs on prostate CSCs was completely repressed after “silencing” the activity of β-catenin by transfection of stem cells with ShRNA. Taken together, our observations suggest that prostate migrating CSCs, with a mesenchymal phenotype, could be triggered by CAFs in a HIF-1α/β-catenin-dependent signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Hair follicle stem cells (bulge cells) are essential for hair regeneration and early epidermal repair after wounding. Here we show that Brg1, a key enzyme in the chromatin-remodeling machinery, is dynamically expressed in bulge cells to control tissue regeneration and repair. In mice, sonic hedgehog (Shh) signals Gli to activate Brg1 in bulge cells to begin hair regeneration, whereas Brg1 recruits NF-κB to activate Shh in matrix cells to sustain hair growth. Such reciprocal Brg1-Shh interaction is essential for hair regeneration. Moreover, Brg1 is indispensable for maintaining the bulge cell reservoir. Without Brg1, bulge cells are depleted over time, partly through the ectopic expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27Kip1. Also, bulge Brg1 is activated by skin injury to facilitate early epidermal repair. Our studies demonstrate a molecular circuit that integrates chromatin remodeling (Brg1), transcriptional regulation (NF-κB, Gli), and intercellular signaling (Shh) to control bulge stem cells during tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR interference confers adaptive, sequence-based immunity against viruses and plasmids and is specified by CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that are transcribed and processed from spacer-repeat units. Pre-crRNA processing is essential for CRISPR interference in all systems studied thus far. Here, our studies of crRNA biogenesis and CRISPR interference in naturally competent Neisseria spp. reveal a unique crRNA maturation pathway in which crRNAs are transcribed from promoters that are embedded within each repeat, yielding crRNA 5′ ends formed by transcription and not by processing. Although crRNA 3′ end formation involves RNase III and trans-encoded tracrRNA, as in other type II CRISPR systems, this processing is dispensable for interference. The meningococcal pathway is the most streamlined CRISPR/Cas system characterized to date. Endogenous CRISPR spacers limit natural transformation, which is the primary source of genetic variation that contributes to immune evasion, antibiotic resistance, and virulence in the human pathogen N. meningitidis.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cells undergo changes in metabolism to meet their energetic and anabolic needs. It is conceivable that mechanisms exist to sense these changes and link them to pathways that eradicate cells primed for cancer development. We report that the tumor suppressor p53 activates a cell death priming mechanism that senses extracellular adenosine. Adenosine, the backbone of ATP, accumulates under conditions of cellular stress or altered metabolism. We show that its receptor, A2B, is upregulated by p53. A2B expression has little effect on cell viability, but ligand engagement activates a caspase- and Puma-dependent apoptotic response involving downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Stimulation of A2B also significantly enhances cell death mediated by p53 and upon accumulation of endogenous adenosine following chemotherapeutic drug treatment and exposure to hypoxia. Since extracellular adenosine also accumulates within many solid tumors, this distinct p53 function links programmed cell death to both a cancer- and therapy-associated metabolic change.

Abstract: The ubiquitous transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels function as non-selective, Ca2+-permeable channels. TRPC channels are activated by stimulation of Gαq-PLC-coupled receptors. Here, we report that TRPC4/TRPC5 can be activated by Gαi. We studied the essential role of Gαi subunits in TRPC4 activation and investigated changes in ion selectivity and pore dilation of the TRPC4 channel elicited by the Gαi2 subunit. Activation of TRPC4 by Gαi2 increased Ca2+ permeability and Ca2+ influx through TRPC4 channels. Co-expression of the muscarinic receptor (M2) and TRPC4 in HEK293 cells induced TRPC4-mediated Ca2+ influx. Moreover, both TRPC4β and the TRPC4β-Gαi2 signaling complex induced inhibition of neurite growth and arborization in cultured hippocampal neurons. Cells treated with KN-93, a CaMKII inhibitor, prevented TRPC4- and TRPC4-Gαi2Q205L-mediated inhibition of neurite branching and growth. These findings indicate an essential role of Gαi proteins in TRPC4 activation and extend our knowledge of the functional role of TRPC4 in hippocampal neurons.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome systems are major proteolytic pathways, whereas function of the Ub-independent proteasome pathway is yet to be clarified. Here, we investigated roles of the Ub-independent REGγ-proteasome proteolytic system in regulating metabolism. We demonstrate that mice deficient for the proteasome activator REGγ exhibit dramatic autophagy induction and are protected against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced liver steatosis through autophagy. Molecularly, prevention of steatosis in the absence of REGγ entails elevated SirT1, a deacetylase regulating autophagy and metabolism. REGγ physically binds to SirT1, promotes its Ub-independent degradation, and inhibits its activity to deacetylate autophagy-related proteins, thereby inhibiting autophagy under normal conditions. Moreover, REGγ and SirT1 dissociate from each other through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism under energy-deprived conditions, unleashing SirT1 to stimulate autophagy. These observations provide a function of the REGγ proteasome in autophagy and hepatosteatosis, underscoring mechanistically a crosstalk between the proteasome and autophagy degradation system in the regulation of lipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Organ formation and growth requires cells to organize into properly patterned three-dimensional architectures. Network formation within the vertebrate vascular system is driven by fusion events between nascent sprouts or between sprouts and pre-existing blood vessels. Here, we describe the cellular activities that occur during blood vessel anastomosis in the cranial vasculature of the zebrafish embryo. We show that the early steps of the fusion process involve endothelial cell recognition, de novo polarization of endothelial cells, and apical membrane invagination and fusion. These processes generate a unicellular tube, which is then transformed into a multicellular tube via cell rearrangements and cell splitting. This stereotypic series of morphogenetic events is typical for anastomosis in perfused sprouts. Vascular endothelial-cadherin plays an important role early in the anastomosis process and is required for filopodial tip cell interactions and efficient formation of a single contact site.

Abstract: Summary
Stimulation of transcriptional elongation is a key activity of leukemogenic MLL fusion proteins. Here, we provide evidence that MLL-ENL also inhibits Polycomb-mediated silencing as a prerequisite for efficient transformation. Biochemical studies identified ENL as a scaffold that contacted the elongation machinery as well as the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) component CBX8. These interactions were mutually exclusive in vitro, corresponding to an antagonistic behavior of MLL-ENL and CBX8 in vivo. CBX8 inhibited elongation in a specific reporter assay, and this effect was neutralized by direct association with ENL. Correspondingly, CBX8-binding-defective MLL-ENL could not fully activate gene loci necessary for transformation. Finally, we demonstrate dimerization of MLL-ENL as a neomorphic activity that may augment Polycomb inhibition and transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Germ cells ensure reproduction and heredity. In mice, primordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors for spermatozoa and oocytes, are induced in pluripotent epiblast by BMP4 and WNT3, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, using an in vitro PGC specification system, we show that WNT3 induces many transcription factors associated with mesoderm in epiblast-like cells through β-CATENIN. Among these, T (BRACHYURY), a classical and conserved mesodermal factor, was essential for robust activation of Blimp1 and Prdm14, two of the germline determinants. T, but not SMAD1 or TCF1, binds distinct regulatory elements of both Blimp1 and Prdm14 and directly upregulates these genes, delineating the downstream PGC program. Without BMP4, a program induced by WNT3 prevents T from activating Blimp1 and Prdm14, demonstrating a permissive role of BMP4 in PGC specification. These findings establish the key signaling mechanism for, and a fundamental role of a mesodermal factor in, mammalian PGC specification.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic screens in invertebrates have discovered many synaptogenic genes and pathways. However, similar genetic studies have not been possible in mammals. We have optimized an automated high-throughput platform that employs automated liquid handling and imaging of primary mammalian neurons. Using this platform, we have screened 3,200 shRNAs targeting 800 proteins. One of the hits identified was LRP6, a coreceptor for canonical Wnt ligands. LRP6 regulates excitatory synaptogenesis and is selectively localized to excitatory synapses. In vivo knockdown of LRP6 leads to a reduction in the number of functional synapses. Moreover, we show that the canonical Wnt ligand, Wnt8A, promotes synaptogenesis via LRP6. These results provide a proof of principle for using a high-content approach to screen for synaptogenic factors in the mammalian nervous system and identify and characterize a Wnt ligand receptor complex that is critical for the development of functional synapses in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
We describe the identification and characterization of circular intronic long noncoding RNAs in human cells, which accumulate owing to a failure in debranching. The formation of such circular intronic RNAs (ciRNAs) can be recapitulated using expression vectors, and their processing depends on a consensus motif containing a 7 nt GU-rich element near the 5′ splice site and an 11 nt C-rich element close to the branchpoint site. In addition, we show that ciRNAs are abundant in the nucleus and have little enrichment for microRNA target sites. Importantly, knockdown of ciRNAs led to the reduced expression of their parent genes. One abundant such RNA, ci-ankrd52, largely accumulates to its sites of transcription, associates with elongation Pol II machinery, and acts as a positive regulator of Pol II transcription. This study thus suggests a cis-regulatory role of noncoding intronic transcripts on their parent coding genes.

Abstract: Summary
The role of the sympathetic nervous system, stress, and hypertension in metabolic syndrome and obesity remains unclear. To clarify this issue, we utilized genetically engineered mice showing chronic sympathoexcitation and hypertension due to lack of Vav3, a Rac1 activator. Here, we report that these animals develop metabolic syndrome under chow diet. However, they show protection from metabolic syndrome and obesity under fatty diets. These effects are elicited by α1-adrenergic- and diet-dependent metabolic changes in liver and the α1/β3 adrenergic-mediated stimulation of brown adipocyte thermogenesis. These responses seem to be engaged by the local action of noradrenaline in target tissues rather than by long-range effects of adrenaline. By contrast, they are not triggered by low parasympathetic drive or the hypertensive state present in Vav3-deficient mice. These results indicate that the sympathetic system plays divergent roles in the etiology of metabolic diseases depending on food regimen, sympathoexcitation source, and disease stage.

Abstract: Summary
Among the cytokines linked to inflammation-associated cancer, interleukin (IL)-6 drives many of the cancer “hallmarks” through downstream activation of the gp130/STAT3 signaling pathway. However, we show that the related cytokine IL-11 has a stronger correlation with elevated STAT3 activation in human gastrointestinal cancers. Using genetic mouse models, we reveal that IL-11 has a more prominent role compared to IL-6 during the progression of sporadic and inflammation-associated colon and gastric cancers. Accordingly, in these models and in human tumor cell line xenograft models, pharmacologic inhibition of IL-11 signaling alleviated STAT3 activation, suppressed tumor cell proliferation, and reduced the invasive capacity and growth of tumors. Our results identify IL-11 signaling as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers.

Abstract: Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels are membrane protein machinery performing selective permeation of external calcium ions. The main Ca2+ selective filters of all high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channel isoforms are commonly composed of four Glu residues (EEEE), while those of low-voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channel isoforms are made up of two Glu and two Asp residues (EEDD). We here investigate how the Asp residues at the pore loops of domains III and IV affect biophysical properties of the Cav3.2 channel. Electrophysiological characterization of the pore mutant channels in which the pore Asp residue(s) were replaced with Glu, showed that both Asp residues critically control the biophysical properties of Cav3.2, including relative permeability between Ba2+ and Ca2+, anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE), voltage dependency of channel activation, Cd2+ blocking sensitivity, and pH effects, in distinctive ways.

Abstract: Summary
WNT signaling controls many biological processes including cell differentiation in metazoans. However, how WNT reprograms cell identity is not well understood. We have investigated the potential role of cellular metabolism in WNT-induced osteoblast differentiation. WNT3A induces aerobic glycolysis known as Warburg effect by increasing the level of key glycolytic enzymes. The metabolic regulation requires LRP5 but not β-catenin and is mediated by mTORC2-AKT signaling downstream of RAC1. Suppressing WNT3A-induced metabolic enzymes impairs osteoblast differentiation in vitro. Deletion of Lrp5 in the mouse, which decreases postnatal bone mass, reduces mTORC2 activity and glycolytic enzymes in bone cells and lowers serum lactate levels. Conversely, mice expressing a mutant Lrp5 that causes high bone mass exhibit increased glycolysis in bone. Thus, WNT-LRP5 signaling promotes bone formation in part through direct reprogramming of glucose metabolism. Moreover, regulation of cellular metabolism may represent a general mechanism contributing to the wide-ranging functions of WNT proteins.

Abstract: Members of the Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) family of proteins are believed to function as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Rab GTPases, which play pivotal roles in intracellular membrane trafficking. Although membrane trafficking is fundamental to neuronal morphogenesis and function, the roles of TBC-family Rab GAPs have been poorly characterized in the nervous system. In this paper, we provide genetic evidence that Tbc1d15-17, the Drosophila homolog of mammalian Rab7-GAP TBC1d15, is required for normal presynaptic growth and postsynaptic organization at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). A lossof-function mutation in tbc1d15-17 or its presynaptic knockdown leads to an increase in synaptic bouton number and NMJ length. tbc1d15-17 mutants are also defective in the distribution of the postsynaptic scaffold Discs-large (Dlg) and in the level of the postsynaptic glutamate subunit GluRIIA. These postsynaptic phenotypes are recapitulated by postsynaptic knockdown of Tbc1d15-17. We also show that presynaptic overexpression of a constitutively active Rab7 mutant in a wild-type background causes a synaptic overgrowth phenotype resembling that of tbc1d15-17 mutants, while a dominant-negative form of Rab7 has the opposite effect. Together, our findings establish a novel role for Tbc1d15-17 and its potential substrate Rab7 in regulating synaptic development.

Abstract: ssrS-encoded 6S RNA is an abundant noncoding RNA that binds σ70-RNA polymerase and regulates expression at a subset of promoters in Escherichia coli. It is transcribed from two tandem promoters, ssrS P1 and ssrS P2. Regulation of transcription from two ssrS promoters in 6S RNA biogenesis was examined. Both P1 and P2 were growth phase-dependently regulated. Depletion of 6S RNA had no effect on growth-phase-dependent transcription from either promoter, whereas overexpression of 6S RNA increased P1 transcription and decreased P2 transcription, suggesting that transcription from P1 and P2 is subject to feedback activation and feedback inhibition, respectively. This feedback regulation disappeared in +fis strains, supporting involvement of Fis in this process. The differential feedback regulation may provide a means for maintaining appropriate cellular concentrations of 6S RNA.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous endocytic accessory proteins (EAPs) mediate assembly and maturation of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) into cargo-containing vesicles. Analysis of EAP function through bulk measurement of cargo uptake has been hampered due to potential redundancy among EAPs and, as we show here, the plasticity and resilience of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Instead, EAP function is best studied by uncovering the correlation between variations in EAP association to individual CCPs and the resulting variations in maturation. However, most EAPs bind to CCPs in low numbers, making the measurement of EAP association via fused fluorescent reporters highly susceptible to detection errors. Here, we present a framework for unbiased measurement of EAP recruitment to CCPs and their direct effects on CCP dynamics. We identify dynamin and the EAP-binding α-adaptin appendage domain of the AP2 adaptor as switches in a regulated, multistep maturation process and provide direct evidence for a molecular checkpoint in CME.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) displays cellular hierarchies harboring a subpopulation of stem-like cells (GSCs). Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), the lysine methyltransferase of Polycomb repressive complex 2, mediates transcriptional repression of prodifferentiation genes in both normal and neoplastic stem cells. An oncogenic role of EZH2 as a transcriptional silencer is well established; however, additional functions of EZH2 are incompletely understood. Here, we show that EZH2 binds to and methylates STAT3, leading to enhanced STAT3 activity by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. The EZH2-STAT3 interaction preferentially occurs in GSCs relative to non-stem bulk tumor cells, and it requires a specific phosphorylation of EZH2. Inhibition of EZH2 reverses the silencing of Polycomb target genes and diminishes STAT3 activity, suggesting therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
To understand what dictates the emerging patterns of de novo DNA methylation in the male germline, we mapped DNA methylation, chromatin, and transcription changes in purified fetal mouse germ cells by using methylated CpG island recovery assay (MIRA)-chip, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip, and strand-specific RNA deep sequencing, respectively. Global de novo methylation occurred by default in prospermatogonia without any apparent trigger from preexisting repressive chromatin marks but was preceded by broad, low-level transcription along the chromosomes, including the four known paternally imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Default methylation was excluded only at precisely aligned constitutive or emerging peaks of H3K4me2, including most CpG islands and some intracisternal A particles (IAPs). Similarly, each maternally imprinted DMR was protected from default DNA methylation among highly methylated DNA by an H3K4me2 peak and transcription initiation at least in one strand. Our results suggest that the pattern of de novo DNA methylation in prospermatogonia is dictated by opposing actions of broad, low-level transcription and dynamic patterns of active chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin remodeling is tightly linked to all DNA-transacting activities. To study chromatin remodeling during DNA repair, we established quantitative fluorescence imaging methods to measure the exchange of histones in chromatin in living cells. We show that particularly H2A and H2B are evicted and replaced at an accelerated pace at sites of UV-induced DNA damage. This accelerated exchange of H2A/H2B is facilitated by SPT16, one of the two subunits of the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) but largely independent of its partner SSRP1. Interestingly, SPT16 is targeted to sites of UV light-induced DNA damage-arrested transcription and is required for efficient restart of RNA synthesis upon damage removal. Together, our data uncover an important role for chromatin dynamics at the crossroads of transcription and the UV-induced DNA damage response.

Abstract: Summary
Although the gut is a central organ of Eumetazoans and is essential for organismal health, our understanding of its morphological and molecular determinants remains rudimentary. Here, we provide a comprehensive atlas of Drosophila adult midgut. Specifically, we uncover a fine-grained regional organization consisting of 14 subregions with distinct morphological, histological, and genetic properties. We also show that Drosophila intestinal regionalization is defined after adult emergence, remains stable throughout life, and reestablishes following acute tissue damage. Additionally, we show that this midgut compartmentalization is achieved through the interplay between pan-midgut and regionalized transcription factors, in concert with spatial activities of morphogens. Interestingly, disruption of the midgut compartmentalization leads to a loss of intestinal homeostasis characterized by an increase in stem cell proliferation and aberrant immune responses. Our integrative analysis of Drosophila midgut compartmentalization provides insights into the conserved mechanisms underlying intestinal regionalization in metazoans.

Abstract: Summary
Centrioles are essential for forming cilia, flagella, and centrosomes and are thus critical for a range of fundamental cellular processes. Despite their importance, the mechanisms governing centriole biogenesis remain incompletely understood. We performed a high-content genome-wide small-interfering-RNA-based screen to identify genes regulating centriole formation in human cells. We designed an algorithm to automatically detect GFP-Centrin foci that, combined with subsequent manual analysis, allowed us to identify 44 genes required for centriole formation and 32 genes needed for restricting centriole number. Detailed follow-up characterization uncovered that the C2 domain protein C2CD3 is required for distal centriole formation and suggests that it functions in the basal body to template primary cilia. Moreover, we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM37 prevents centriole reduplication events. We developed a dynamic web interface containing all images and numerical features as a powerful resource to investigate facets of centrosome biology.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies suggest a hierarchical model in which lineage-determining factors act in a collaborative manner to select and prime cell-specific enhancers, thereby enabling signal-dependent transcription factors to bind and function in a cell-type-specific manner. Consistent with this model, TLR4 signaling primarily regulates macrophage gene expression through a pre-existing enhancer landscape. However, TLR4 signaling also induces priming of ∼3,000 enhancer-like regions de novo, enabling visualization of intermediates in enhancer selection and activation. Unexpectedly, we find that enhancer transcription precedes local mono- and dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2). H3K4 methylation at de novo enhancers is primarily dependent on the histone methyltransferases Mll1, Mll2/4, and Mll3 and is significantly reduced by inhibition of RNA polymerase II elongation. Collectively, these findings suggest an essential role of enhancer transcription in H3K4me1/2 deposition at de novo enhancers that is independent of potential functions of the resulting eRNA transcripts.

Abstract: Summary
Therapeutic resistance in melanoma and other cancers arises via irreversible genetic, and dynamic phenotypic, heterogeneity. Here, we use directed phenotype switching in melanoma to sensitize melanoma cells to lineage-specific therapy. We show that methotrexate (MTX) induces microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) expression to inhibit invasiveness and promote differentiation-associated expression of the melanocyte-specific Tyrosinase gene. Consequently, MTX sensitizes melanomas to a tyrosinase-processed antifolate prodrug 3-O-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-(−)-epicatechin (TMECG), that inhibits the essential enzyme DHFR with high affinity. The combination of MTX and TMECG leads to depletion of thymidine pools, double-strand DNA breaks, and highly efficient E2F1-mediated apoptosis in culture and in vivo. Importantly, this drug combination delivers an effective and tissue-restricted antimelanoma therapy in vitro and in vivo irrespective of BRAF, MEK, or p53 status.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages control the resolution of inflammation through the transition from a proinflammatory (M1) to an anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype. Here, we present evidence for a role of AMPKα1, a master regulator of energy homeostasis, in macrophage skewing that occurs during skeletal muscle regeneration. Muscle regeneration was impaired in AMPKα1−/− mice. In vivo loss-of-function (LysM-Cre;AMPKα1fl/fl mouse) and rescue (bone marrow transplantation) experiments showed that macrophagic AMPKα1 was required for muscle regeneration. Cell-based experiments revealed that AMPKα1−/− macrophages did not fully acquire the phenotype or the functions of M2 cells. In vivo, AMPKα1−/− leukocytes did not acquire the expression of M2 markers during muscle regeneration. Skewing from M1 toward M2 phenotype upon phagocytosis of necrotic and apoptotic cells was impaired in AMPKα1−/− macrophages and when AMPK activation was prevented by the inhibition of its upstream activator, CaMKKβ. In conclusion, AMPKα1 is crucial for phagocytosis-induced macrophage skewing from a pro- to anti-inflammatory phenotype at the time of resolution of inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
The DEAD-box adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) Prp5p facilitates U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) binding to the intron branch site region during spliceosome assembly. We present crystal structures of S. cerevisiae Prp5p alone and in complex with ADP at 2.12 Å and 1.95 Å resolution. The three-dimensional packing of Prp5p subdomains differs strikingly from that so far observed in other DEAD-box proteins: two RecA-like subdomains adopt an “open state” conformation stabilized by extensive interactions involving sequences that flank the two subdomains. This conformation is distinct from that required for ATP hydrolysis. Consistent with this, Prp5p mutations that destabilize interdomain interactions exhibited increased ATPase activity in vitro and inhibited splicing of suboptimal branch site substrates in vivo, whereas restoration of interdomain interactions reversed these effects. We conclude that the Prp5p open state conformation is biologically relevant and that disruption of the interdomain interaction facilitates a large-scale conformational change of Prp5p during U2 snRNP-branch site recognition.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful copying of the genome is essential for life. In eukaryotes, a single archaeo-eukaryotic primase (AEP), DNA primase, is required for the initiation and progression of DNA replication. Here we have identified additional eukaryotic AEP-like proteins with DNA-dependent primase and/or polymerase activity. Uniquely, the genomes of trypanosomatids, a group of kinetoplastid protozoa of significant medical importance, encode two PrimPol-like (PPL) proteins. In the African trypanosome, PPL2 is a nuclear enzyme present in G2 phase cells. Following PPL2 knockdown, a cell-cycle arrest occurs after the bulk of DNA synthesis, the DNA damage response is activated, and cells fail to recover. Consistent with this phenotype, PPL2 replicates damaged DNA templates in vitro, including templates containing the UV-induced pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproduct. Furthermore, PPL2 accumulates at sites of nuclear DNA damage. Taken together, our results indicate an essential role for PPL2 in postreplication tolerance of endogenous DNA damage, thus allowing completion of genome duplication.

Abstract: It is well established that intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) controls the inotropic state of the myocardium, and evidence mounts that a “Ca2+ clock” controls the chronotropic state of the heart. Recent findings describe a calcium-activated nonselective cation channel (NSCCa) in various cardiac preparations sharing hallmark characteristics of the transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4). TRPM4 is functionally expressed throughout the heart and has been implicated as a NSCCa that mediates membrane depolarization. However, the functional significance of TRPM4 in regards to Ca2+ signaling and its effects on cellular excitability and pacemaker function remains inconclusive. Here, we show by Fura2 Ca-imaging that pharmacological inhibition of TRPM4 in HL-1 mouse cardiac myocytes by 9-phenanthrol (10μM) and flufenamic acid (10 and 100μM) decreases Ca2+ oscillations followed by an overall increase in [Ca2+]i. The latter occurs also in HL-1 cells in Ca2+-free solution and after depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ with thapsigargin (10μM). These pharmacologic agents also depolarize HL-1 cell mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, by on-cell voltage clamp we show that 9-phenanthrol reversibly inhibits membrane current; by fluorescence immunohistochemistry we demonstrate that HL-1 cells display punctate surface labeling with TRPM4 antibody; and by immunoblotting using this antibody we show these cells express a 130–150kDa protein, as expected for TRPM4. We conclude that 9-phenanthrol inhibits TRPM4 ion channels in HL-1 cells, which in turn decreases Ca2+ oscillations followed by a compensatory increase in [Ca2+]i from an intracellular store other than the sarcoplasmic reticulum. We speculate that the most likely source is the mitochondrion.

Abstract: Summary
IκB kinase α (IKKα) activity is required for ErbB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis. Here, we show that IKKα and its activator, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), support the expansion of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) that copurify with a CD24medCD49fhi population from premalignant ErbB2-expressing mammary glands. Upon activation, IKKα enters the nucleus, phosphorylates the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27/Kip1, and stimulates its nuclear export or exclusion. Reduced p27 expression rescues mammary tumorigenesis in mice deficient in IKKα kinase activity and restores TIC self-renewal. IKKα is also likely to be involved in human breast cancer, where its expression shows an inverse correlation with metastasis-free survival, and its presence in the nucleus of invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) is associated with decreased nuclear p27 abundance.

Abstract: Under hypoxic conditions, cells activate a transcriptional response mainly driven by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIF-1α stabilization and activity are known to be regulated by thioredoxin 1 (Txn1), but how the thioredoxin system regulates the hypoxic response is unknown. By examining the effects of Txn1 overexpression on HIF-1α function in HeLa, HT-29, MCF-7 and EMT6 cell lines, we found that this oxidoreductase did not stabilize HIF-1α, yet could increase its activity. These effects were dependent on the redox function of Txn1. However, Txn1 deficiency did not affect HIF-1α hypoxic-stabilization and activity, and overexpression of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR1), the natural Txn1 reductase, had no influence on HIF-1α activity. Moreover, overexpression of Txn1 in TR1 deficient HeLa and EMT6 cells was still able to increase HIF-1α hypoxic activity. These results indicate that Txn1 is not essential for HIF-1α hypoxic stabilization or activity, that its overexpression can increase HIF-1α hypoxic activity, and that this effect is observed regardless of TR1 status. Thus, regulation of HIF-1α by the thioredoxin system depends on the specific levels of this system’s major components.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-fusion-mediated somatic-cell reprogramming can be induced in culture; however, whether this process occurs in mammalian tissues remains enigmatic. Here, we show that upon activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, mouse retinal neurons can be transiently reprogrammed in vivo back to a precursor stage. This occurs after their spontaneous fusion with transplanted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Moreover, we demonstrate that retinal damage is essential for cell-hybrid formation in vivo. Newly formed hybrids can proliferate, commit to differentiation toward a neuroectodermal lineage, and finally develop into terminally differentiated neurons. This results in partial regeneration of the damaged retinal tissue, with functional rescue. Following retinal damage and induction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, cell-fusion-mediated reprogramming also occurs after endogenous recruitment of bone-marrow-derived cells in the eyes. Our data demonstrate that in vivo reprogramming of terminally differentiated retinal neurons after their fusion with HSPCs is a potential mechanism for tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a key regulator of cell division and is overexpressed in many types of human cancers. Compared to its well-characterized role in mitosis, little is known about PLK1 functions in interphase. Here, we report that PLK1 mediates estrogen receptor (ER)-regulated gene transcription in human breast cancer cells. PLK1 interacts with ER and is recruited to ER cis-elements on chromatin. PLK1-coactivated genes included classical ER target genes such as Ps2, Wisp2, and Serpina3 and were enriched in developmental and tumor-suppressive functions. Performing large-scale phosphoproteomics of estradiol-treated MCF7 cells in the presence or absence of the specific PLK1 inhibitor BI2536, we identified several PLK1 end targets involved in transcription, including the histone H3K4 trimethylase MLL2, the function of which on ER target genes was impaired by PLK1 inhibition. Our results propose a mechanism for the tumor-suppressive role of PLK1 in mammals as an interphase transcriptional regulator.

P-TEFb activation classically occurs by a feedback-regulated process of signal-induced, reversible release of active Cdk9-cyclin T modules from large, inactive 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) complexes. Here, we have identified an alternative pathway of irreversible P-TEFb activation in megakaryopoiesis that is mediated by dissolution of the 7SK snRNP complex. In this pathway, calpain 2 cleavage of the core 7SK snRNP component MePCE promoted P-TEFb release and consequent upregulation of a cohort of cytoskeleton remodeling factors, including α-actinin-1. In a subset of human megakaryocytic leukemias, the transcription factor GATA1 undergoes truncating mutation (GATA1s). Here, we linked the GATA1s mutation to defects in megakaryocytic upregulation of calpain 2 and of P-TEFb-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling factors. Restoring calpain 2 expression in GATA1s mutant megakaryocytes rescued normal development, implicating this morphogenetic pathway as a target in human leukemogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Reversible cellular quiescence is critical for developmental processes in metazoan organisms and is characterized by a reduction in cell size and transcriptional activity. We show that the Aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein Ring1B have essential roles in regulating transcriptionally active genes in quiescent lymphocytes. Ring1B and Aurora B bind to a wide range of active promoters in resting B and T cells. Conditional knockout of either protein results in reduced transcription and binding of RNA Pol II to promoter regions and decreased cell viability. Aurora B phosphorylates histone H3S28 at active promoters in resting B cells as well as inhibiting Ring1B-mediated ubiquitination of histone H2A and enhancing binding and activity of the USP16 deubiquitinase at transcribed genes. Our results identify a mechanism for regulating transcription in quiescent cells that has implications for epigenetic regulation of the choice between proliferation and quiescence.

Abstract: Summary
Postnatal and adult human and monkey fibroblasts were infected with Sendai virus containing the Yamanaka factors for 24 hr, then they were cultured in a chemically defined medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β inhibitor SB431542, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β inhibitor CHIR99021 at 39°C for inactivation of the virus. Induced neural progenitor (iNP) colonies appeared as early as day 13 and can be expanded for >20 passages. Under the same defined condition, no induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) colonies formed at either 37°C or 39°C. The iNPs predominantly express hindbrain genes and differentiate into hindbrain neurons, and when caudalized, they produced an enriched population of spinal motor neurons. Following transplantation into the forebrain, the iNP-derived cells retained the hindbrain identity. The ability to generate defined, integration-free iNPs from adult primate fibroblasts under a defined condition with predictable fate choices will facilitate disease modeling and therapeutic development.

The Drosophila Selectin Furrowed Mediates Intercellular Planar Cell Polarity Interactions via Frizzled Stabilization,

Abstract: Summary
Establishment of planar cell polarity (PCP) in a tissue requires coordination of directional signals from cell to cell. It is thought that this is mediated by the core PCP factors, which include cell-adhesion molecules. Here, we demonstrate that furrowed, the Drosophila selectin, is required for PCP generation. Disruption of PCP in furrowed-deficient flies results from a primary defect in Fz levels and cell adhesion. Furrowed localizes at or near apical junctions, largely colocalizing with Frizzled and Flamingo (Fmi). It physically interacts with and stabilizes Frizzled, and it mediates intercellular Frizzled-Van Gogh (Vang)/Strabismus interactions, similarly to Fmi. Furrowed does so through a homophilic cell-adhesion role that is distinct from its known carbohydrate-binding function described during vertebrate blood-cell/endothelial cell interactions. Importantly, the carbohydrate function is dispensable for PCP establishment. In vivo studies suggest that Furrowed functions partially redundantly with Fmi, mediating intercellular Frizzled-Vang interactions between neighboring cells.

Abstract: Summary
A high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screen targeting 542 genes of the human kinome was used to discover regulators of RNAi. Here we report that the proto-oncogene Akt-3/PKBγ (Akt3) phosphorylates Argonaute 2 (Ago2) at S387, which downregulates cleavage and upregulates translational repression of endogenous microRNA (miRNA)-targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs). We further demonstrate that Akt3 coimmunoprecipitates with Ago2 and phosphorylation of Ago2 at S387 facilitates its interaction with GW182 and localization to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies), where miRNA-targeted mRNAs are thought to be stored and degraded. Therefore, Akt3-mediated phosphorylation of Ago2 is a molecular switch between target mRNA cleavage and translational repression activities of Ago2.

Abstract: Summary
ABCA12 is involved in the transport of ceramides in skin, but it may play a wider role in lipid metabolism. We show that, in Abca12-deficient macrophages, cholesterol efflux failed to respond to activation with LXR agonists. Abca12 deficiency caused a reduction in the abundance of Abca1, Abcg1, and Lxrβ. Overexpression of Lxrβ reversed the effects. Mechanistically, Abca12 deficiency did not affect expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism. Instead, a physical association between Abca1, Abca12, and Lxrβ proteins was established. Abca12 deficiency enhanced interaction between Abca1 and Lxrβ and the degradation of Abca1. Overexpression of ABCA12 in HeLa-ABCA1 cells increased the abundance and stability of ABCA1. Abca12 deficiency caused an accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages and the formation of foam cells, impaired reverse cholesterol transport in vivo, and increased the development of atherosclerosis in irradiated Apoe−/− mice reconstituted with Apoe−/−Abca12−/− bone marrow. Thus, ABCA12 regulates the cellular cholesterol metabolism via an LXRβ-dependent posttranscriptional mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
RAS genes are commonly mutated in cancer; however, RAS mutations are rare in breast cancer, despite frequent hyperactivation of Ras and ERK. Here, we report that the RasGAP gene, RASAL2, functions as a tumor and metastasis suppressor. RASAL2 is mutated or suppressed in human breast cancer, and RASAL2 ablation promotes tumor growth, progression, and metastasis in mouse models. In human breast cancer, RASAL2 loss is associated with metastatic disease; low RASAL2 levels correlate with recurrence of luminal B tumors; and RASAL2 ablation promotes metastasis of luminal mouse tumors. Additional data reveal a broader role for RASAL2 inactivation in other tumor types. These studies highlight the expanding role of RasGAPs and reveal an alternative mechanism of activating Ras in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The homeodomain protein TGIF (TG-interacting factor) restricts TGF-β/Smad cytostatic signaling by interfering with the nucleocytoplasmic transit of the tumor suppressor cPML. Here, we identify PHRF1 as a ubiquitin ligase that enforces TGIF decay by driving its ubiquitination at lysine 130. In so doing, PHRF1 ensures redistribution of cPML into the cytoplasm, where it associates with SARA and coordinates activation of Smad2 by the TGF-β receptor. The PHRF1 gene resides within the tumor suppressor locus 11p15.5, which displays frequent loss in a wide variety of malignancies, including breast cancer. Remarkably, we found that the PHRF1 gene is deleted or silenced in a high proportion of human breast cancer samples and cancer cell lines. Reconstitution of PHRF1 into deficient cells impeded their propensity to form tumors in vivo, most likely because of the reemergence of TGF-β responsiveness. These findings unveil a paradigm behind inactivation of the cPML tumor suppressor network in human malignancies.

Abstract: Whereas kainate (KA)-induced neurodegeneration has been intensively investigated, the contribution of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in neuronal Ca2+ overload ([Ca2+]i) is still controversial. Using Ca2+ imaging and patch-clamp techniques, we found different types of Ca2+ entry in cultured rat cortical neurons. The presence of Ca2+ in the extracellular solution was required to generate the [Ca2+]i responses to 30μM N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) or KA. The dynamics of NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i responses were fast, while KA-induced responses developed slower reaching high [Ca2+]i. Ifenprodil, a specific inhibitor of the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs, reduced NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i responses suggesting expression of GluN1/GluN2B receptors. Using IEM-1460, a selective blocker of Ca2+-permeable GluA2-subunit lacking AMPARs, we found three neuronal responses to KA: (i) IEM-1460 resistant neurons which are similar to pyramidal neurons expressing Ca2+-impermeable GluA2-rich AMPARs; (ii) Neurons exhibiting nearly complete block of both KA-induced currents and [Ca2+]i signals by IEM-1460 may represent interneurons expressing GluA2-lacking AMPARs and (iii) neurons with moderate sensitivity to IEM-1460. Ouabain at 1nM prevented the neuronal Ca2+ overload induced by KA. The data suggest, that cultured rat cortical neurons maintain functional phenotypes of the adult brain cortex, and demonstrate the key contribution of the Na/K-ATPase in neuroprotection against KA excitotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
To improve replication fidelity, mismatch repair (MMR) must detect non-Watson-Crick base pairs and direct their repair to the nascent DNA strand. Eukaryotic MMR in vitro requires pre-existing strand discontinuities for initiation; consequently, it has been postulated that MMR in vivo initiates at Okazaki fragment termini in the lagging strand and at nicks generated in the leading strand by the mismatch-activated MLH1/PMS2 endonuclease. We now show that a single ribonucleotide in the vicinity of a mismatch can act as an initiation site for MMR in human cell extracts and that MMR activation in this system is dependent on RNase H2. As loss of RNase H2 in S.cerevisiae results in a mild MMR defect that is reflected in increased mutagenesis, MMR in vivo might also initiate at RNase H2-generated nicks. We therefore propose that ribonucleotides misincoporated during DNA replication serve as physiological markers of the nascent DNA strand.

Abstract: Summary
Delineating the mechanism or mechanisms that regulate the specification of hemogenic endothelial cells from primordial endothelium is critical for optimizing their derivation from human stem cells for clinical therapies. We previously determined that retinoic acid (RA) is required for hemogenic specification, as well as cell-cycle control, of endothelium during embryogenesis. Herein, we define the molecular signals downstream of RA that regulate hemogenic endothelial cell development and demonstrate that cell-cycle control is required for this process. We found that re-expression of c-Kit in RA-deficient (Raldh2−/−) primordial endothelium induced Notch signaling and p27 expression, which restored cell-cycle control and rescued hemogenic endothelial cell specification and function. Re-expression of p27 in RA-deficient and Notch-inactivated primordial endothelial cells was sufficient to correct their defects in cell-cycle regulation and hemogenic endothelial cell development. Thus, RA regulation of hemogenic endothelial cell specification requires c-Kit, notch signaling, and p27-mediated cell-cycle control.

Abstract: Summary
Stress-regulated signaling pathways protect mitochondrial proteostasis and function from pathologic insults. Despite the importance of stress-regulated signaling pathways in mitochondrial proteome maintenance, the molecular mechanisms by which these pathways maintain mitochondrial proteostasis remain largely unknown. We identify Tim17A as a stress-regulated subunit of the translocase of the inner membrane 23 (TIM23) mitochondrial protein import complex. We show that Tim17A protein levels are decreased downstream of stress-regulated translational attenuation induced by eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation through a mechanism dependent on the mitochondrial protease YME1L. Furthermore, we demonstrate that decreasing Tim17A attenuates TIM23-dependent protein import, promotes the induction of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR)-associated proteostasis genes, and confers stress resistance in C. elegans and mammalian cells. Thus, our results indicate that Tim17A degradation is a stress-responsive mechanism by which cells adapt mitochondrial protein import efficiency and promote mitochondrial proteostasis in response to the numerous pathologic insults that induce stress-regulated translation attenuation.

Abstract: Utilizing a novel molecular model of TRPC3, based on the voltage-gated sodium channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NaVAB) as template, we performed structure-guided mutagenesis experiments to identify amino acid residues involved in divalent permeation and gating. Substituted cysteine accessibility screening within the predicted selectivity filter uncovered amino acids 629–631 as the narrowest part of the permeation pathway with an estimated pore diameter of <5.8Å. E630 was found to govern not only divalent permeability but also sensitivity of the channel to block by ruthenium red. Mutations in a hydrophobic cluster at the cytosolic termini of transmembrane segment 6, corresponding to the S6 bundle crossing structure in NaVAB, distorted channel gating. Removal of a large hydrophobic residue (I667A or I667E) generated channels with approximately 60% constitutive activity, suggesting I667 as part of the dynamic structure occluding the permeation path. Destabilization of the gate was associated with reduced Ca2+ permeability, altered cysteine cross-linking in the selectivity filter and promoted channel block by ruthenium red. Collectively, we present a structural model of the TRPC3 permeation pathway and localize the channel's selectivity filter and the occluding gate. Moreover, we provide evidence for allosteric coupling between the gate and the selectivity filter in TRPC3.

Abstract: Summary
Most deaths from breast cancer result from tumor recurrence, but mechanisms underlying tumor relapse are largely unknown. We now report that Par-4 is downregulated during tumor recurrence and that Par-4 downregulation is necessary and sufficient to promote recurrence. Tumor cells with low Par-4 expression survive therapy by evading a program of Par-4-dependent multinucleation and apoptosis that is otherwise engaged following treatment. Low Par-4 expression is associated with poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and an increased risk of relapse in patients with breast cancer, and Par-4 is downregulated in residual tumor cells that survive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our findings identify Par-4-induced multinucleation as a mechanism of cell death in oncogene-addicted cells and establish Par-4 as a negative regulator of breast cancer recurrence.

Abstract: Summary
Dosage compensation in Drosophila is an epigenetic phenomenon utilizing proteins and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) for transcriptional upregulation of the male X chromosome. Here, by using UV crosslinking followed by deep sequencing, we show that two enzymes in the Male-Specific Lethal complex, MLE RNA helicase and MSL2 ubiquitin ligase, bind evolutionarily conserved domains containing tandem stem-loops in roX1 and roX2 RNAs in vivo. These domains constitute the minimal RNA unit present in multiple copies in diverse arrangements for nucleation of the MSL complex. MLE binds to these domains with distinct ATP-independent and ATP-dependent behavior. Importantly, we show that different roX RNA domains have overlapping function, since only combinatorial mutations in the tandem stem-loops result in severe loss of dosage compensation and consequently male-specific lethality. We propose that repetitive structural motifs in lncRNAs could provide plasticity during multiprotein complex assemblies to ensure efficient targeting in cis or in trans along chromosomes.

Abstract: Store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) are activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores following agonist-mediated Ca2+ release. Previously we demonstrated that Ca2+ influx through SOCs elicits exocytosis efficiently in pancreatic duct epithelial cells (PDEC). Here we describe the biophysical, pharmacological, and molecular properties of the duct epithelial SOCs using Ca2+ imaging, whole-cell patch-clamp, and molecular biology. In PDEC, agonists of purinergic, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptors coupled to phospholipase C activated SOC-mediated Ca2+ influx as Ca2+ was released from intracellular stores. Direct measurement of [Ca2+] in the ER showed that SOCs greatly slowed depletion of the ER. Using IP3 or thapsigargin in the patch pipette elicited inwardly rectifying SOC currents. The currents increased ∼8-fold after removal of extracellular divalent cations, suggesting competitive permeation between mono- and divalent cations. The current was completely blocked by high doses of La3+ and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) but only partially depressed by SKF-96365. In polarized PDEC, SOCs were localized specifically to the basolateral membrane. RT-PCR screening revealed the expression of both STIM and Orai proteins for the formation of SOCs in PDEC. By expression of fluorescent STIM1 and Orai1 proteins in PDEC, we confirmed that colocalization of the two proteins increases after store depletion. In conclusion, basolateral Ca2+ entry through SOCs fills internal Ca2+ stores depleted by external stimuli and will facilitate cellular processes dependent on cytoplasmic Ca2+ such as salt and mucin secretion from the exocrine pancreatic ducts.

Abstract: Summary
Tubes of differing cellular architecture connect into networks. In the Drosophila tracheal system, two tube types connect within single cells (terminal cells); however, the genes that mediate this interconnection are unknown. Here we characterize two genes that are essential for this process: lotus, required for maintaining a connection between the tubes, and wheezy, required to prevent local tube dilation. We find that lotus encodes N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor 2 (NSF2), whereas wheezy encodes Germinal center kinase III (GCKIII). GCKIIIs are effectors of Cerebral cavernous malformation 3 (CCM3), a protein mutated in vascular disease. Depletion of Ccm3 by RNA interference phenocopies wheezy; thus, CCM3 and GCKIII, which prevent capillary dilation in humans, prevent tube dilation in Drosophila trachea. Ectopic junctional and apical proteins are present in wheezy terminal cells, and we show that tube dilation is suppressed by reduction of NSF2, of the apical determinant Crumbs, or of septate junction protein Varicose.

Abstract: Summary
Catabolic conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) cause loss of muscle mass by unclear mechanisms. In muscle biopsies from CKD patients, we found activated Stat3 (p-Stat3) and hypothesized that p-Stat3 initiates muscle wasting. We created mice with muscle-specific knockout (KO) that prevents activation of Stat3. In these mice, losses of body and muscle weights were suppressed in models with CKD or acute diabetes. A small-molecule that inhibits Stat3 activation produced similar responses, suggesting a potential for translation strategies. Using CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ) KO mice and C2C12 myotubes with knockdown of C/EBPδ or myostatin, we determined that p-Stat3 initiates muscle wasting via C/EBPδ, stimulating myostatin, a negative muscle growth regulator. C/EBPδ KO also improved survival of CKD mice. We verified that p-Stat3, C/EBPδ, and myostatin were increased in muscles of CKD patients. The pathway from p-Stat3 to C/EBPδ to myostatin and muscle wasting could identify therapeutic targets that prevent muscle wasting.

Abstract: Summary
The Drosophila piRNA pathway provides an RNA-based immune system that defends the germline genome against selfish genetic elements. Two interrelated branches of the piRNA system exist: somatic cells that support oogenesis only employ Piwi, whereas germ cells utilize a more elaborate pathway centered on the three gonad-specific Argonaute proteins (Piwi, Aubergine, and Argonaute 3). While several key factors of each branch have been identified, our current knowledge is insufficient to explain the complex workings of the piRNA machinery. Here, we report a reverse genetic screen spanning the ovarian transcriptome in an attempt to uncover the full repertoire of genes required for piRNA-mediated transposon silencing in the female germline. Our screen reveals key factors of piRNA-mediated transposon silencing, including the piRNA biogenesis factors CG2183 (GASZ) and Deadlock. Our data uncover a previously unanticipated set of factors preferentially required for repression of different transposon types.

Abstract: Summary
Generating a balanced network of inhibitory and excitatory neurons during development requires precise transcriptional control. In the dorsal spinal cord, Ptf1a, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription activator, maintains this delicate balance by inducing homeodomain (HD) transcription factors such as Pax2 to specify the inhibitory lineage while suppressing HD factors such as Tlx1/3 that specify the excitatory lineage. We uncover the mechanism by which Ptf1a represses excitatory cell fate in the inhibitory lineage. We identify Prdm13 as a direct target of Ptf1a and reveal that Prdm13 actively represses excitatory cell fate by binding to regulatory sequences near the Tlx1 and Tlx3 genes to silence their expression. Prdm13 acts through multiple mechanisms, including interactions with the bHLH factor Ascl1, to repress Ascl1 activation of Tlx3. Thus, Prdm13 is a key component of a highly coordinated transcriptional network that determines the balance of inhibitory versus excitatory neurons in the dorsal spinal cord.

Abstract: Summary
Apoptotic cells are observed in the early developing brain. Apoptosis deficiency is proposed to cause brain overgrowth, but here we show that brain malformations in apoptosis-deficient mutants are due to insufficient brain ventricle expansion as a result of uncompleted cranial neural tube closure. Apoptosis eliminates Fgf8-expressing cells in the anterior neural ridge (ANR), which acts as an organizing center of the forebrain by producing FGF8 morphogen. Deficiency of apoptosis leads to the accumulation of undead and nonproliferative cells in the ventral part of the ANR. The undead cells in apoptosis-deficient mutants express Fgf8 continuously, which perturbs gene expression in the ventral forebrain. Thus, apoptosis within a specific subdomain of the ANR is required for correct temporal elimination of an FGF8-producing region within a limited developmental time window, thereby ensuring proper forebrain development.

Abstract: Summary
Notch2, but not Notch1, plays indispensable roles in kidney organogenesis, and Notch2 haploinsufficiency is associated with Alagille syndrome. We proposed that proximal nephron fates are regulated by a threshold that requires nearly all available free Notch intracellular domains (NICDs) but could not identify the mechanism that explains why Notch2 (N2) is more important than Notch1 (N1). By generating mice that swap their ICDs, we establish that the overall protein concentration, expression domain, or ICD amino acid composition does not account for the differential requirement of these receptors. Instead, we find that the N2 extracellular domain (NECD) increases Notch protein localization to the cell surface during kidney development and is cleaved more efficiently upon ligand binding. This context-specific asymmetry in NICD release efficiency is further enhanced by Fringe. Our results indicate that an elevated N1 surface level could compensate for the loss of N2 signal in specific cell contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Cells contain many important protein complexes involved in performing and regulating structural, metabolic, and signaling functions. One major challenge in cell biology is to elucidate the organization and mechanisms of robustness of these complexes in vivo. We developed a systematic approach to study structural dependencies within complexes in living cells by deleting subunits and measuring pairwise interactions among other components. We used our methodology to perturb two conserved eukaryotic complexes: the retromer and the nuclear pore complex. Our results identify subunits that are critical for the assembly of these complexes, reveal their structural architecture, and uncover mechanisms by which protein interactions are modulated. Our results also show that paralogous proteins play a key role in the robustness of protein complexes and shape their assembly landscape. Our approach paves the way for studying the response of protein interactomes to mutations and enhances our understanding of genotype-phenotype maps.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy dysfunction has been implicated in misfolded protein accumulation and cellular toxicity in several diseases. Whether alterations in autophagy also contribute to the pathology of lipid-storage disorders is not clear. Here, we show defective autophagy in Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease associated with cholesterol accumulation, where the maturation of autophagosomes is impaired because of defective amphisome formation caused by failure in SNARE machinery, whereas the lysosomal proteolytic function remains unaffected. Expression of functional NPC1 protein rescues this defect. Inhibition of autophagy also causes cholesterol accumulation. Compromised autophagy was seen in disease-affected organs of Npc1 mutant mice. Of potential therapeutic relevance is that HP-β-cyclodextrin, which is used for cholesterol-depletion treatment, impedes autophagy, whereas stimulating autophagy restores its function independent of amphisome formation. Our data suggest that a low dose of HP-β-cyclodextrin that does not perturb autophagy, coupled with an autophagy inducer, may provide a rational treatment strategy for NPC1 disease.

Abstract: Summary
The interactions of Meis, Prep, and Pbx1 TALE homeoproteins with Hox proteins are essential for development and disease. Although Meis and Prep behave similarly in vitro, their in vivo activities remain largely unexplored. We show that Prep and Meis interact with largely independent sets of genomic sites and select different DNA-binding sequences, Prep associating mostly with promoters and housekeeping genes and Meis with promoter-remote regions and developmental genes. Hox target sequences associate strongly with Meis but not with Prep binding sites, while Pbx1 cooperates with both Prep and Meis. Accordingly, Meis1 shows strong genetic interaction with Pbx1 but not with Prep1. Meis1 and Prep1 nonetheless coregulate a subset of genes, predominantly through opposing effects. Notably, the TALE homeoprotein binding profile subdivides Hox clusters into two domains differentially regulated by Meis1 and Prep1. During evolution, Meis and Prep thus specialized their interactions but maintained significant regulatory coordination.

Abstract: Artificial extracellular matrices play important roles in the regulation of stem cell behavior. To generate materials for tissue engineering, active functional groups, such as amino, carboxyl, and hydroxyl, are often introduced to change the properties of the biomaterial surface. In this study, we chemically modified coverslips to create surfaces with different amino densities and investigated the adhesion, migration, and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) under serum-free culture conditions. We observed that a higher amino density significantly promoted NSCs attachment, enhanced neuronal differentiation and promoted excitatory synapse formation in vitro. These results indicate that the amino density significantly affected the biological behavior of NSCs. Thus, the density and impact of functional groups in extracellular matrices should be considered in the research and development of materials for tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
A key feature in Huntington disease (HD) is the accumulation of mutant Huntingtin (HTT) protein, which may be regulated by posttranslational modifications. Here, we define the primary sites of SUMO modification in the amino-terminal domain of HTT, show modification downstream of this domain, and demonstrate that HTT is modified by the stress-inducible SUMO-2. A systematic study of E3 SUMO ligases demonstrates that PIAS1 is an E3 SUMO ligase for both HTT SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 modification and that reduction of dPIAS in a mutant HTT Drosophila model is protective. SUMO-2 modification regulates accumulation of insoluble HTT in HeLa cells in a manner that mimics proteasome inhibition and can be modulated by overexpression and acute knockdown of PIAS1. Finally, the accumulation of SUMO-2-modified proteins in the insoluble fraction of HD postmortem striata implicates SUMO-2 modification in the age-related pathogenic accumulation of mutant HTT and other cellular proteins that occurs during HD progression.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to contribute to cancer metastasis, but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. To define early steps in this cellular transformation, we analyzed human mammary epithelial cells with tightly regulated expression of Snail-1, a master regulator of EMT. After Snail-1 induction, epithelial markers were repressed within 6 hr, and mesenchymal genes were induced at 24 hr. Snail-1 binding to its target promoters was transient (6–48 hr) despite continued protein expression, and it was followed by both transient and long-lasting chromatin changes. Pharmacological inhibition of selected histone acetylation and demethylation pathways suppressed the induction as well as the maintenance of Snail-1-mediated EMT. Thus, EMT involves an epigenetic switch that may be prevented or reversed with the use of small-molecule inhibitors of chromatin modifiers.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage is linked to multiple human diseases, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and aging. Little is known about the role of chromatin accessibility in DNA repair. Here, we find that the deacetylase sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is one of the earliest factors recruited to double-strand breaks (DSBs). SIRT6 recruits the chromatin remodeler SNF2H to DSBs and focally deacetylates histone H3K56. Lack of SIRT6 and SNF2H impairs chromatin remodeling, increasing sensitivity to genotoxic damage and recruitment of downstream factors such as 53BP1 and breast cancer 1 (BRCA1). Remarkably, SIRT6-deficient mice exhibit lower levels of chromatin-associated SNF2H in specific tissues, a phenotype accompanied by DNA damage. We demonstrate that SIRT6 is critical for recruitment of a chromatin remodeler as an early step in the DNA damage response, indicating that proper unfolding of chromatin plays a rate-limiting role. We present a unique crosstalk between a histone modifier and a chromatin remodeler, regulating a coordinated response to prevent DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
Senescence, perceived as a cancer barrier, is paradoxically associated with inflammation, which promotes tumorigenesis. Here, we characterize a distinct low-grade inflammatory process in stressed epithelium that is related to para-inflammation; this process either represses or promotes tumorigenesis, depending on p53 activity. Csnk1a1 (CKIα) downregulation induces a senescence-associated inflammatory response (SIR) with growth arrest in colorectal tumors, which loses its growth control capacity in the absence of p53 and instead, accelerates growth and invasiveness. Corresponding processes occur in CKIα-deleted intestinal organoids, assuming tumorigenic transformation properties ex vivo, upon p53 loss. Treatment of organoids and mice with anti-inflammatory agents suppresses the SIR and prevents p53-deficient organoid transformation and mouse carcinogenesis. SIR/para-inflammation suppression may therefore constitute a key mechanism in the anticarcinogenic effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Single-ended double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a common form of spontaneous DNA break, generated when the replisome encounters a discontinuity in the DNA template. Given their prevalence, understanding the mechanisms governing the fate(s) of single-ended DSBs is important. We describe the influence of the Ku heterodimer and Mre11 nuclease activity on processing of single-ended DSBs. Separation-of-function alleles of yku70 were derived that phenocopy Ku deficiency with respect to single-ended DSBs but remain proficient for NHEJ. The Ku mutants fail to regulate Exo1 activity, and bypass the requirement for Mre11 nuclease activity in the repair of camptothecin-induced single-ended DSBs. Ku mutants exhibited reduced affinity for DNA ends, manifest as both reduced end engagement and enhanced probability of diffusing inward on linear DNA. This study reveals an interplay between Ku and Mre11 in the metabolism of single-ended DSBs that is distinct from repair pathway choice at double-ended DSBs.

Abstract: Summary
Homologous recombination leads to the formation of DNA joint molecules (JMs) that must be resolved to allow chromosome segregation, but how resolution is temporally coupled with chromosome segregation is unknown. Here, we have analyzed the role of the cell-cycle kinases Cdk and Cdc5 in coordinating these events through their involvement in the phosphoregulation of the Mus81-Mms4 nuclease. By identifying CDC5 and MMS4 mutants that uncouple Mus81-Mms4 activation from cell-cycle progression, we show that JM disengagement, prior to anaphase initiation, safeguards chromosome segregation. By simultaneously stimulating the cleavage of cohesin and activating Mus81-Mms4 at the G2/M transition, Cdk and Cdc5 coordinate the sequential elimination of all chromosomal interactions in preparation for chromosome segregation. Conversely, untimely Cdc5 expression increases crossover frequency due to premature activation of Mus81-Mms4. Therefore, temporal restriction of JM resolution, imposed by Cdk/Cdc5, minimizes the potential for loss of heterozygosity while preventing chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy.

Abstract: Summary
The initial step in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis requires processing of the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) from a longer primary transcript. Many pre-miRNAs originate from introns, and both a mature miRNA and a spliced RNA can be generated from the same transcription unit. We have identified a mechanism in which RNA splicing negatively regulates the processing of pre-miRNAs that overlap exon-intron junctions. Computational analysis identified dozens of such pre-miRNAs, and experimental validation demonstrated competitive interaction between the Microprocessor complex and the splicing machinery. Tissue-specific alternative splicing regulates maturation of one such miRNA, miR-412, resulting in effects on its targets that code a protein network involved in neuronal cell death processes. This mode of regulation specifically controls maturation of splice-site-overlapping pre-miRNAs but not pre-miRNAs located completely within introns or exons of the same transcript. Our data present a biological role of alternative splicing in regulation of miRNA biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Stochastic mechanisms are sometimes utilized to diversify cell fates, especially in nervous systems. In the Drosophila retina, stochastic expression of the PAS-bHLH transcription factor Spineless (Ss) controls photoreceptor subtype choice. In one randomly distributed subset of R7 photoreceptors, Ss activates Rhodopsin4 (Rh4) and represses Rhodopsin3 (Rh3); counterparts lacking Ss express Rh3 and repress Rh4. In the dorsal third region of the retina, the Iroquois Complex transcription factors induce Rh3 in Rh4-expressing R7s. Here, we show that Ss levels are controlled in a binary on/off manner throughout the retina yet are attenuated in the dorsal third region to allow Rh3 coexpression with Rh4. Whereas the sensitivity of rh3 repression to differences in Ss levels generates stochastic and regionalized patterns, the robustness of rh4 activation ensures its stochastic expression throughout the retina. Our findings show how stochastic and regional inputs are integrated to control photoreceptor subtype specification in the Drosophila retina.

Abstract: Summary
The branching of axons is a fundamental aspect of nervous system development and neuroplasticity. We report that branching of sensory axons in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) occurs at sites populated by stalled mitochondria. Translational machinery targets to presumptive branching sites, followed by recruitment of mitochondria to these sites. The mitochondria promote branching through ATP generation and the determination of localized hot spots of active axonal mRNA translation, which contribute to actin-dependent aspects of branching. In contrast, mitochondria do not have a role in the regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton during NGF-induced branching. Collectively, these observations indicate that sensory axons exhibit multiple potential sites of translation, defined by presence of translational machinery, but active translation occurs following the stalling and respiration of mitochondria at these potential sites of translation. This study reveals a local role for axonal mitochondria in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and axonal mRNA translation underlying branching.

Abstract: Summary
We report that the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1, which is induced in most tumor types, is required for neoplastic growth and confers transforming potential to noncancerous cells. TRAP1 binds to and inhibits succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), the complex II of the respiratory chain. The respiratory downregulation elicited by TRAP1 interaction with SDH promotes tumorigenesis by priming the succinate-dependent stabilization of the proneoplastic transcription factor HIF1α independently of hypoxic conditions. These findings provide a mechanistic clue to explain the switch to aerobic glycolysis of tumors and identify TRAP1 as a promising antineoplastic target.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by cerebral deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, which are generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. APP and the secretases are membrane associated, but whether membrane trafficking controls Aβ levels is unclear. Here, we performed an RNAi screen of all human Rab-GTPases, which regulate membrane trafficking, complemented with a Rab-GTPase-activating protein screen, and present a road map of the membrane-trafficking events regulating Aβ production. We identify Rab11 and Rab3 as key players. Although retromers and retromer-associated proteins control APP recycling, we show that Rab11 controlled β-secretase endosomal recycling to the plasma membrane and thus affected Aβ production. Exome sequencing revealed a significant genetic association of Rab11A with late-onset AD, and network analysis identified Rab11A and Rab11B as components of the late-onset AD risk network, suggesting a causal link between Rab11 and AD. Our results reveal trafficking pathways that regulate Aβ levels and show how systems biology approaches can unravel the molecular complexity underlying AD.

Abstract: The migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are essential elements during the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis. An increasing number of studies have reported that extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including the CCN protein family, play a significant role in VSMC migration and proliferation. CCN4 is a member of the CCN protein family, which controls cell development and survival in multiple systems of the body. Here, we sought to determine whether CCN4 is involved in VSMC migration and proliferation. We examined the effect of CCN4 using rat cultured VSMCs. In cultured VSMCs, CCN4 stimulated the adhesion and migration of VSMCs in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was blocked by an antibody for integrin α5β1. CCN4 expression was enhanced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Furthermore, knockdown of CCN4 by siRNA significantly inhibited the VSMC proliferation. CCN4 also could up-regulate the expression level of marker proteins of the VSMCs phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that CCN4 is involved in the migration and proliferation of VSMCs. Inhibition of CCN4 may provide a promising strategy for the prevention of restenosis after vascular interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian pain-related sensory neurons are derived from TrkA lineage neurons located in the dorsal root ganglion. These neurons project to peripheral targets throughout the body, which can be divided into superficial and deep tissues. Here, we find that the transcription factor Runx1 is required for the development of many epidermis-projecting TrkA lineage neurons. Accordingly, knockout of Runx1 leads to the selective loss of sensory innervation to the epidermis, whereas deep tissue innervation and two types of deep tissue pain are unaffected. Within these cutaneous neurons, Runx1 suppresses a large molecular program normally associated with sensory neurons that innervate deep tissues, such as muscle and visceral organs. Ectopic expression of Runx1 in these deep sensory neurons causes a loss of this molecular program and marked deficits in deep tissue pain. Thus, this study provides insight into a genetic program controlling the segregation of cutaneous versus deep tissue pain pathways.

Abstract: The reorganization of brain structures after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) insult is crucial to functional outcome. Although the pattern of neuronal rewiring is well-documented after ischemic stroke, the study of brain plasticity after ICH has been focusing on the enhancement of dendritic complexity. Here we hypothesized that functional restoration after ICH involves brain reorganization which may be favorably modulated by stem cell transplantation. In this study, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were transplanted into the perilesional sites of collagenaseinduced ICH in adult rats one day after ICH injury. Forelimb functional recovery was monitored with modified limb placing and vibrissae-elicited forelimb placement tests. Anterograde and retrograde tracing were used to assess the reorganization of bilateral forelimb areas of the sensorimotor cortex. We found that in rats transplanted with BMSCs after ICH injury, axonal sprouting occurred in the contralateral caudal forelimb area of the cortex, and was significantly higher than in ICH rat models that received only the vehicle (P < 0.01). The number of positive neurons in the ipsilateral rostral forelimb area of the cortex of the BMSC group was 1.5to 4.5-fold greater than in the vehicle group (P < 0.05). No difference was found between the BMSC and vehicle groups in hemispheric atrophy or labeled neurons in the ipsilateral caudal forelimb area (P = 0.193). Scores for improved functional behavior in the BMSC group were in accord with the results from histology. Neuronal plasticity of the denervated corticospinal tract at bilateral forelimb areas of the cortex in the collagenase-induced ICH rat models was significantly enhanced by BMSC transplantation. BMSC transplantation may facilitate functional recovery after ICH injury.

Abstract: Summary
T cell responses to low-affinity T cell receptor (TCR) ligands occur in the context of infection, tumors, and autoimmunity despite diminished TCR signal strength. The processes that enable such responses remain unclear. We show that distinct mechanisms drive effector/memory development in high- and low-affinity T cells. Low-affinity cells preferentially differentiate into memory precursors of a central memory phenotype that are interleukin (IL)-12Rlo, IL-7Rhi, and Eomeshi. Strikingly, in contrast to naive cells, low-affinity memory cells were impaired in the response to low- but not high-affinity ligands, indicating that low-affinity cells are programmed to generate diverse immune responses while avoiding autoreactivity. Affinity and antigen dose directly correlated with IL-12R signal input and T-bet but not with Eomes expression because low- affinity signals were more potent inducers of Eomes at a high antigen dose. Our studies explain how weak antigenic signals induce complete primary immune responses and provide a framework for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient repair of UV-induced DNA damage requires the precise coordination of nucleotide excision repair (NER) with numerous other biological processes. To map this crosstalk, we generated a differential genetic interaction map centered on quantitative growth measurements of >45,000 double mutants before and after different doses of UV radiation. Integration of genetic data with physical interaction networks identified a global map of 89 UV-induced functional interactions among 62 protein complexes, including a number of links between the RSC complex and several NER factors. We show that RSC is recruited to both silenced and transcribed loci following UV damage where it facilitates efficient repair by promoting nucleosome remodeling. Finally, a comparison of the response to high versus low levels of UV shows that the degree of genetic rewiring correlates with dose of UV and reveals a network of dose-specific interactions. This study makes available a large resource of UV-induced interactions, and it illustrates a methodology for identifying dose-dependent interactions based on quantitative shifts in genetic networks.

Abstract: Extracellular matrix remodeling is a continuous process that is critical to maintaining tissue homeostasis, and alterations in this process have been implicated in chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, lung fibrosis, and emphysema. Collagen and elastin are subject to ascorbate-dependent hydroxylation. While this post-translational modification in collagen is critical for function, the role of hydroxylation of elastin is not well understood. A number of studies have indicated that ascorbate leads to reduced elastin synthesis. However, these studies were limited to analysis of cells grown under traditional 2D tissue culture conditions. To investigate this process we evaluated elastin and collagen synthesis in primary rat neonatal pulmonary fibroblasts in response to ascorbate treatment in traditional 2D culture and within 3D cross-linked gelatin matrices (Gelfoam). We observed little change in elastin or collagen biosynthesis in standard 2D cultures treated with ascorbate, yet observed a dramatic increase in elastin protein and mRNA levels in response to ascorbate in 3D cell-Gelfoam constructs. These data suggest that the cell-ECM architecture dictates pulmonary cell response to ascorbate, and that approaches aimed toward stimulating ECM repair or engineering functional cell-derived matrices should consider all aspects of the cellular environment.

Abstract: Summary
Many Rho GTPase activation proteins (RhoGAPs) are deleted or downregulated in cancers, but the functional consequences are still unclear. Here, we show that the RhoGAP ArhGAP11A induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by binding to the tumor suppressor p53. The RhoGAP domain of ArhGAP11A binds to the tetramerization domain of p53, but not to its family members p63 or p73. The interaction stabilizes the tetrameric conformation of p53 and enhances its DNA-binding activity, thereby inducing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Upon DNA damage stress, ArhGAP11A accumulates in the nucleus and interacts with p53, whereas knockdown of ArhGAP11A partially blocks p53 transcriptional activity. These findings explain why RhoGAPs are frequently deleted in cancers and suggest that the RhoGAP family sits at the crossroads between the cell-migration and proliferation pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional pausing, which regulates transcript elongation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, is thought to involve formation of alternative RNA polymerase conformations in which nucleotide addition is inhibited in part by restriction of trigger loop (TL) folding. The polymorphous TL must convert from a random coil to a helical hairpin that contacts the nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) substrate to allow rapid nucleotide addition. Understanding the distribution of TL conformations in different enzyme states is made difficult by the TL's small size and sensitive energetics. Here, we report a Cys-pair reporter strategy to elucidate the relative occupancies of different TL conformations in E. coli RNA polymerase based on the ability of Cys residues engineered into the TL and surrounding regions to form disulfide bonds. Our results indicate that a paused complex stabilized by a nascent RNA hairpin favors nonproductive TL conformations that persist after NTP binding but can be reversed by the elongation factor RfaH.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and can be classified based on gene expression profiles that reflect distinct epithelial subtypes. We identify prostate-derived ETS factor (PDEF) as a mediator of mammary luminal epithelial lineage-specific gene expression and as a factor required for tumorigenesis in a subset of breast cancers. PDEF levels strongly correlate with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive luminal breast cancer, and PDEF transcription is inversely regulated by ER and GATA3. Furthermore, PDEF is essential for luminal breast cancer cell survival and is required in models of endocrine resistance. These results offer insights into the function of this ETS factor that are clinically relevant and may be of therapeutic value for patients with breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy.
