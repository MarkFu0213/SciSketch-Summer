Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cells (HMSCs) have been applied in various clinic settings. Ion channels play an important role in cellular physiology. However, the potential role of cationic channels in regulating the proliferation and migration properties of hMSCs remains to be determined. In the present study, the functional expression of ion channels in hMSCs was investigated by patch clamp. MTT assay and BrdU stainings were used to assess the proliferation of hMSCs. hMSC migration was evaluated by Transwell migration assays. The results show that sodium-, L-type calcium, potassium currents have been identified in hMSCs. TEA (K+ channel blocker), nifedipine (Ca2+ channel blocker) can inhibit both proliferation and migration of hMSCs. The increase of extracellular Ca2+ concentration promoted both proliferation and migration of hMSCs. TTX, a Na+ channel blocker, promoted cell proliferation but inhibited cell migration. Our data suggest that cationic channels (sodium, L-type calcium, potassium channels) play important roles in regulating proliferation and migration of hMSCs.

Abstract: Summary
After injury or cytokine stimulation, fibroblasts transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, contractile cells that secrete extracellular matrix for wound healing and tissue remodeling. Here, a genome-wide screen identified TRPC6, a Ca2+ channel necessary and sufficient for myofibroblast transformation. TRPC6 overexpression fully activated myofibroblast transformation, while fibroblasts lacking Trpc6 were refractory to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and angiotensin II-induced transdifferentiation. Trpc6 gene-deleted mice showed impaired dermal and cardiac wound healing after injury. The profibrotic ligands TGF-β and angiotensin II induced TRPC6 expression through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) serum response factor (SRF) signaling via the TRPC6 promoter. Once induced, TRPC6 activates the Ca2+-responsive protein phosphatase calcineurin, which itself induced myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Moreover, inhibition of calcineurin prevented TRPC6-dependent transdifferentiation and dermal wound healing. These results demonstrate an obligate function for TRPC6 and calcineurin in promoting myofibroblast differentiation, suggesting a comprehensive pathway for myofibroblast formation in conjunction with TGF-β, p38 MAPK, and SRF.

Abstract: Summary
Actin filaments and myosin II are evolutionarily conserved force-generating components of the contractile ring during cytokinesis. Here we show that in budding yeast, actin filament depolymerization plays a major role in actomyosin ring constriction. Cofilin mutation or chemically stabilizing actin filaments attenuate actomyosin ring constriction. Deletion of myosin II motor domain or the myosin regulatory light chain reduced the contraction rate and also the rate of actin depolymerization in the ring. We constructed a quantitative microscopic model of actomyosin ring constriction via filament sliding driven by both actin depolymerization and myosin II motor activity. Model simulations based on experimental measurements support the notion that actin depolymerization is the predominant mechanism for ring constriction. The model predicts invariability of total contraction time regardless of the initial ring size, as originally reported for C. elegans embryonic cells. This prediction was validated in yeast cells of different sizes due to different ploidies.

Abstract: Summary
The regulatory networks of the DNA damage response (DDR) encompass many proteins and posttranslational modifications. Here, we use mass spectrometry-based proteomics to analyze the systems-wide response to DNA damage by parallel quantification of the DDR-regulated phosphoproteome, acetylome, and proteome. We show that phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks are regulated more strongly compared to acetylation. Among the phosphorylated proteins identified are many putative substrates of DNA-PK, ATM, and ATR kinases, but a majority of phosphorylated proteins do not share the ATM/ATR/DNA-PK target consensus motif, suggesting an important role of downstream kinases in amplifying DDR signals. We show that the splicing-regulator phosphatase PPM1G is recruited to sites of DNA damage, while the splicing-associated protein THRAP3 is excluded from these regions. Moreover, THRAP3 depletion causes cellular hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Collectively, these data broaden our knowledge of DNA damage signaling networks and highlight an important link between RNA metabolism and DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Reversal of promoter DNA hypermethylation and associated gene silencing is an attractive cancer therapy approach. The DNA methylation inhibitors decitabine and azacitidine are efficacious for hematological neoplasms at lower, less toxic, doses. Experimentally, high doses induce rapid DNA damage and cytotoxicity, which do not explain the prolonged time to response observed in patients. We show that transient exposure of cultured and primary leukemic and epithelial tumor cells to clinically relevant nanomolar doses, without causing immediate cytotoxicity, produce an antitumor “memory” response, including inhibition of subpopulations of cancer stem-like cells. These effects are accompanied by sustained decreases in genomewide promoter DNA methylation, gene reexpression, and antitumor changes in key cellular regulatory pathways. Low-dose decitabine and azacitidine may have broad applicability for cancer management.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA editing enzyme ADAR chemically modifies adenosine (A) to inosine (I), which is interpreted by the ribosome as a guanosine. Here we assess cotranscriptional A-to-I editing in Drosophila by isolating nascent RNA from adult fly heads and subjecting samples to high throughput sequencing. There are a large number of edited sites within nascent exons. Nascent RNA from an ADAR-null strain was also sequenced, indicating that almost all A-to-I events require ADAR. Moreover, mRNA editing levels correlate with editing levels within the cognate nascent RNA sequence, indicating that the extent of editing is set cotranscriptionally. Surprisingly, the nascent data also identify an excess of intronic over exonic editing sites. These intronic sites occur preferentially within introns that are poorly spliced cotranscriptionally, suggesting a link between editing and splicing. We conclude that ADAR-mediated editing is more widespread than previously indicated and largely occurs cotranscriptionally.

Abstract: Summary
The double-stranded RNA binding protein Staufen1 (Stau1) is involved in diverse gene expression pathways. For Stau1-mediated mRNA decay (SMD) in mammals, Stau1 binds to the 3′ untranslated region of target mRNA and recruits Upf1 to elicit rapid mRNA degradation. However, the events downstream of Upf1 recruitment and the biological importance of SMD remain unclear. Here we show that SMD involves PNRC2, decapping activity, and 5′-to-3′ exonucleolytic activity. In particular, Upf1 serves as an adaptor protein for the association of PNRC2 and Stau1. During adipogenesis, Stau1 and PNRC2 increase in abundance, Upf1 becomes hyperphosphorylated, and consequently SMD efficiency is enhanced. Intriguingly, downregulation of SMD components attenuates adipogenesis in a way that is rescued by downregulation of an antiadipogenic factor, Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), the mRNA of which is identified as a substrate of SMD. Our data thus identify a biological role for SMD in adipogenesis.

Abstract: The identification of true causal loci to unravel the statistical evidence of genotype-phenotype correlations and the biological relevance of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is a challenging issue in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we introduced a novel method for the prioritization of SNPs based on p-values from GWAS. The method uses functional evidence from populations, including phenotype-associated gene expressions. Based on the concept of genetic interactions, such as perturbation of gene expression by genetic variation, phenotype and gene expression related SNPs were prioritized by adjusting the p-values of SNPs. We applied our method to GWAS data related to drug-induced cytotoxicity. Then, we prioritized loci that potentially play a role in drug-induced cytotoxicity. By generating an interaction model, our approach allowed us not only to identify causal loci, but also to find intermediate nodes that regulate the flow of information among causal loci, perturbed gene expression, and resulting phenotypic variation.

Abstract: Summary
RanBP2/Nup358 is an essential protein with roles in nuclear transport and mitosis, and is one of the few known SUMO E3 ligases. However, why RanBP2 functions in vivo has been unclear: throughout the cell cycle it stably interacts with RanGAP1∗SUMO1 and Ubc9, whose binding sites overlap with the E3 ligase region. Here we show that cellular RanBP2 is quantitatively associated with RanGAP1, indicating that complexed rather than free RanBP2 is the relevant E3 ligase. Biochemical reconstitution of the RanBP2/RanGAP1∗SUMO1/Ubc9 complex enabled us to characterize its activity on the endogenous substrate Borealin. We find that the complex is a composite E3 ligase rather than an E2–E3 complex, and demonstrate that complex formation induces activation of a catalytic site that shows no activity in free RanBP2. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism of an important E3 ligase, and extend the concept of multisubunit E3 ligases from ubiquitin to the SUMO field.

Abstract: Chemerin, a recognized chemoattractant, is expressed in adipose tissue and plays a role in adipocytes differentiation and metabolism. Gender- and adipose tissue-specific differences in human chemerin expression have not been well characterized. Therefore, these differences were assessed in the present study. The body mass index (BMI) and the circulating levels of chemerin and other inflammatory, adiposity and insulin resistance markers were assessed in female and male adults of varying degree of obesity. Chemerin mRNA expression was also measured in paired subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples obtained from a subset of the study subjects. Serum chemerin concentrations correlated positively with BMI and serum leptin levels and negatively with high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. No correlation was found between serum chemerin concentrations and fasting glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, C-reactive protein or adiponectin. Similarly, no relation was observed with the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values. Gender- and adipose tissue-specific differences were observed in chemerin mRNA expression levels, with expression significantly higher in women than men and in subcutaneous than visceral adipose tissue. Interestingly, we found a significant negative correlation between circulating chemerin levels and chemerin mRNA expression in subcutaneous fat. Among the subjects studied, circulating chemerin levels were associated with obesity markers but not with markers of insulin resistance. At the tissue level, fat depot-specific differential regulation of chemerin mRNA expression might contribute to the distinctive roles of subcutaneous vs. visceral adipose tissue in human obesity.

Abstract: Summary
The timing and mechanisms of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) segregation and transmission in mammals are poorly understood. Genetic bottleneck in female germ cells has been proposed as the main phenomenon responsible for rapid intergenerational segregation of heteroplasmic mtDNA. We demonstrate here that mtDNA segregation occurs during primate preimplantation embryogenesis resulting in partitioning of mtDNA variants between daughter blastomeres. A substantial shift toward homoplasmy occurred in fetuses and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from these heteroplasmic embryos. We also observed a wide range of heteroplasmic mtDNA variants distributed in individual oocytes recovered from these fetuses. Thus, we present here evidence for a previously unknown mtDNA segregation and bottleneck during preimplantation embryo development, suggesting that return to the homoplasmic condition can occur during development of an individual organism from the zygote to birth, without a passage through the germline.

Abstract: Summary
Rescuing the function of mutant p53 protein is an attractive cancer therapeutic strategy. Using the National Cancer Institute's anticancer drug screen data, we identified two compounds from the thiosemicarbazone family that manifest increased growth inhibitory activity in mutant p53 cells, particularly for the p53R175 mutant. Mechanistic studies reveal that NSC319726 restores WT structure and function to the p53R175 mutant. This compound kills p53R172H knockin mice with extensive apoptosis and inhibits xenograft tumor growth in a 175-allele-specific mutant p53-dependent manner. This activity depends upon the zinc ion chelating properties of the compound as well as redox changes. These data identify NSC319726 as a p53R175 mutant reactivator and as a lead compound for p53-targeted drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Assembly of microRNA ribonucleoproteins (miRNPs) or RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) is essential for the function of miRNAs and initiates from processing of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by Dicer or by Ago2. Here, we report an in vitro miRNP/RISC assembly assay programmed by pre-miRNAs from mammalian cell lysates. Combining in vivo studies in Dicer Knockout cells reconstituted with wild-type or catalytically inactive Dicer, we find that the miRNA loading complex (miRLC) is the primary machinery linking pre-miRNA processing to miRNA loading. We show that a miRNA precursor deposit complex (miPDC) plays a crucial role in Dicer-independent miRNA biogenesis and promotes miRNP assembly of certain Dicer-dependent miRNAs. Furthermore, we find that 5′-uridine, 3′-mid base pairing, and 5′-mid mismatches within pre-miRNAs promote their assembly into miPDC. Our studies provide a comprehensive view of miRNP/RISC assembly pathways in mammals, and our assay provides a versatile platform for further mechanistic dissection of such pathways in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Increased transcription of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) by RNA Polymerase I is a common feature of human cancer, but whether it is required for the malignant phenotype remains unclear. We show that rDNA transcription can be therapeutically targeted with the small molecule CX-5461 to selectively kill B-lymphoma cells in vivo while maintaining a viable wild-type B cell population. The therapeutic effect is a consequence of nucleolar disruption and activation of p53-dependent apoptotic signaling. Human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines also show high sensitivity to inhibition of rDNA transcription that is dependent on p53 mutational status. These results identify selective inhibition of rDNA transcription as a therapeutic strategy for the cancer specific activation of p53 and treatment of hematologic malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Acquired resistance to Docetaxel precedes fatality in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). However, strategies that target Docetaxel resistant cells remain elusive. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we identified a subpopulation of cells that survive Docetaxel exposure. This subpopulation lacks differentiation markers and HLA class I (HLAI) antigens, while overexpressing the Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways. These cells were found in prostate cancer tissues and were related to tumor aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis. Notably, targeting Notch and Hedgehog signaling depleted this population through inhibition of the survival molecules AKT and Bcl-2, suggesting a therapeutic strategy for abrogating Docetaxel resistance in HRPC. Finally, these cells exhibited potent tumor-initiating capacity, establishing a link between chemotherapy resistance and tumor progression.

Abstract: Calcium (Ca2+) dynamics were evaluated in fluorescently labeled sea urchin secretory vesicles using confocal microscopy. 71% of the vesicles examined exhibited one or more transient increases in the fluorescence signal that was damped in time. The detection of transient increases in signal was dependent upon the affinity of the fluorescence indicator; the free Ca2+ concentration in the secretory vesicles was estimated to be in the range of ∼10 to 100μM. Non-linear stochastic analysis revealed the presence of extra variance in the Ca2+ dependent fluorescence signal. This noise process increased linearly with the amplitude of the Ca2+ signal. Both the magnitude and spatial properties of this noise process were dependent upon the activity of vesicle p-type (Cav2.1) Ca2+ channels. Blocking the p-type Ca2+ channels with ω-agatoxin decreased signal variance, and altered the spatial noise pattern within the vesicle. These fluorescence signal properties are consistent with vesicle Ca2+ dynamics and not simply due to obvious physical properties such as gross movement artifacts or pH driven changes in Ca2+ indicator fluorescence. The results suggest that the free Ca2+ content of cortical secretory vesicles is dynamic; this property may modulate the exocytotic fusion process.

Abstract: Summary
Moderate concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as coregulatory signaling molecules, whereas exceedingly high concentrations trigger cell death. Here, we identify ROS-induced acetylation of the proapoptotic kinase HIPK2 as a molecular mechanism that controls the threshold discerning sensitivity from resistance toward ROS-mediated cell death. SUMOylation of HIPK2 at permissive ROS concentrations allows the constitutive association of HDAC3 and keeps HIPK2 in the nonacetylated state. Elevated ROS concentrations prevent SUMOylation of HIPK2 and, consequently, reduce association of HDAC3, thus leading to the acetylation of HIPK2. Reconstitution experiments showed that HIPK2-dependent genes cause decreased ROS levels. Although a nonacetylatable HIPK2 mutant enhanced ROS-induced cell death, an acetylation-mimicking variant ensured cell survival even under conditions of high oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
The open promoter complex (OC) is a central intermediate during transcription initiation that contains a DNA bubble. Here, we employ single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer experiments and Nano-Positioning System analysis to determine the three-dimensional architecture of a minimal OC consisting of promoter DNA, including a TATA box and an 11-nucleotide mismatched region around the transcription start site, TATA box-binding protein (TBP), RNA polymerase (Pol) II, and general transcription factor (TF)IIB and TFIIF. In this minimal OC, TATA-DNA and TBP reside above the Pol II cleft between clamp and protrusion domains. Downstream DNA is dynamically loaded into and unloaded from the Pol II cleft at a timescale of seconds. The TFIIB core domain is displaced from the Pol II wall, where it is located in the closed promoter complex. These results reveal large overall structural changes during the initiation-elongation transition, which are apparently accommodated by the intrinsic flexibility of TFIIB.

Abstract: Summary
Completion of DNA replication after replication stress depends on PCNA, which undergoes monoubiquitination to stimulate direct bypass of DNA lesions by specialized DNA polymerases or is polyubiquitinated to promote recombination-dependent DNA synthesis across DNA lesions by template switching mechanisms. Here we report that the ZRANB3 translocase, a SNF2 family member related to the SIOD disorder SMARCAL1 protein, is recruited by polyubiquitinated PCNA to promote fork restart following replication arrest. ZRANB3 depletion in mammalian cells results in an increased frequency of sister chromatid exchange and DNA damage sensitivity after treatment with agents that cause replication stress. Using in vitro biochemical assays, we show that recombinant ZRANB3 remodels DNA structures mimicking stalled replication forks and disassembles recombination intermediates. We therefore propose that ZRANB3 maintains genomic stability at stalled or collapsed replication forks by facilitating fork restart and limiting inappropriate recombination that could occur during template switching events.

Abstract: Arsenic is highly toxic to living cells, especially skin, and skin cancer is induced by drinking water containing arsenic. The molecular mechanisms of arsenic-induced cancer, however, are not well understood. To examine the initial processes in the development of arsenic-induced cancer, we analyzed calcium signaling at an early stage of arsenic treatment of human primary cells and compared the effects with those observed with arsenic treatment in carcinoma-derived cells. We found that arsenic inhibited inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) function in the endoplasmic reticulum by inducing phosphorylation, which led to decreased intracellular calcium levels. Blockade of IP3R phosphorylation by the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt inhibitor wortmannin rescued calcium signaling. In contrast, arsenic treatment of cells derived from a carcinoma (human squamous carcinoma; HSC-1) for 1h had no obvious effect. Taken together, these results suggest that arsenic-induced reduction in calcium signaling is one of the initial mechanisms underlying the malignant transformation in the development of skin cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of proximal cytoplasmic dilation in the leading process (PCDLP) of migratory neocortical neurons is crucial for somal translocation and neuronal migration, processes that require the elaborate coordination of F-actin dynamics, centrosomal movement, and nucleokinesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the Rac1-interacting scaffold protein POSH is essential for neuronal migration in vivo. We demonstrate that POSH is concentrated in the PCDLP and that knockdown of POSH impairs PCDLP formation, centrosome translocation, and nucleokinesis. Furthermore, POSH colocalizes with F-actin and the activated form of Rac1. Knockdown of POSH impairs F-actin assembly and delocalizes activated Rac1. Interference of Rac1 activity also disrupts F-actin assembly and PCDLP formation and perturbs neuronal migration. Thus, we have uncovered a mechanism by which POSH regulates the localization of activated Rac1 and F-actin assembly to control PCDLP formation and subsequent somal translocation of migratory neurons.

Abstract: Iron homeostasis plays a crucial role in growth and division of cells in all kingdoms of life. Although yeast iron metabolism has been extensively studied, little is known about the molecular mechanism of response to surplus iron. In this study, expression profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of surplus iron revealed a dual effect at 1 and 4 h. A cluster of stress-responsive genes was upregulated via activation of the stress-resistance transcription factor Msn4, which indicated the stress effect of surplus iron on yeast metabolism. Genes involved in aerobic metabolism and several anabolic pathways are also upregulated in iron-surplus conditions, which could significantly accelerate yeast growth. This dual effect suggested that surplus iron might participate in a more complex metabolic network, in addition to serving as a stress inducer. These findings contribute to our understanding of the global response of yeast to the fluctuating availability of iron in the environment.

Abstract: Summary
Gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) under specific physiological conditions often involves complex interactions between multiple miRNAs and a large number of their targets, as well as coordination with other regulatory mechanisms, limiting the effectiveness of classical genetic methods to identify miRNA functions. We took a systematic approach to analyze the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) in individual tissues of C. elegans and found that mRNAs encoded by pathogen-responsive genes were dramatically overrepresented in the intestinal miRISC, and that multiple miRNAs accumulated in the intestinal miRISCs upon infection. Inactivation of the miRISC or ablation of miRNAs from multiple families resulted in overexpression of several pathogen-responsive genes under basal conditions and, surprisingly, enhanced worm survival on pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results indicate that much of the miRNA activity in the gut is dedicated to attenuating the activity of the pathogen-response system, uncovering a complex physiological function of the miRNA network.

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarization is crucial during development and tissue homeostasis and is regulated by conserved proteins of the Scribble, Crumbs, and Par complexes. In mouse skin tumorigenesis, Par3 deficiency results in reduced papilloma formation and growth. Par3 mediates its tumor-promoting activity through regulation of growth and survival, since Par3 deletion increases apoptosis and reduces growth in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, Par3-deficient mice are predisposed to formation of keratoacanthomas, cutaneous tumors thought to originate from different cellular origin and frequently observed in humans. Par3 expression is reduced in both mouse and human keratoacanthomas, indicating tumor-suppressive properties of Par3. Our results identify a dual function of Par3 in skin cancer, with both pro-oncogenic and tumor-suppressive activity depending on the tumor type.

Abstract: Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [ARS]-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2) has been implicated in the control of cell fate and lung cell differentiation. A variant of AIMP2 lacking exon 2 (AIMP2-DX2) is expressed in different cancer cells. We previously studied the expression level of AIMP2-DX2 in several lung cell lines and reported elevated expression levels of AIMP2-DX2 in NCI-H460 and NCI-H520. Here, we report that the suppression of AIMP2-DX2 by lentivirus mediated short hairpin (sh)RNA (sh-DX2) decreased the rate of glucose uptake and glucose transporters (Gluts) in NCI-H460 cells. Down-regulation of AIMP2-DX2 reduced glycosyltransferase (GnT)-V in the Golgi apparatus, while inducing the GnT-V antagonist GnT-III. Down-regulation of AIMP2-DX2 also suppressed the epidermal growth factor receptor/mitogen activated protein kinase (EGFR/MAPK) signaling pathway, leading to the decrease of the proliferation marker Ki-67 expression in nuclei. Furthermore, dual luciferase activity reduced capdependent protein translation in cells infected with sh-DX2. These results suggest that AIMP2-DX2 may be a relevant therapeutic target for lung cancer, and that the sh-DX2 lentiviral system can be an appropriate method for lung cancer therapy.

Abstract: A recurrent paradigm in calcium signaling is the coordination of the target response of the calcium signal with activation of metabolic energy production to support that response. This occurs in many tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle where contractile activity and ATP production are coordinately regulated by the frequency and amplitude of calcium transients, endocrine and exocrine cells that use calcium to drive the secretory process, and hepatocytes where the downstream targets of calcium include both catabolic and anabolic processes. The primary mechanism by which calcium enhances the capacity for energy production is through calcium-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, achieved by increasing NADH production and respiratory chain flux. Although this enhances energy supply, it also has the potential for deleterious consequences resulting from increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The negative consequences of calcium-dependent mitochondrial activation can be ameliorated when the underlying cytosolic calcium signals occur as brief calcium spikes or oscillations, with signal strength encoded through the spike frequency (frequency modulation). Frequency modulation increases signal fidelity, and reduces pathological effects of calcium, including excess mitochondrial ROS production and apoptotic or necrotic outcomes. The present article reviews these issues using data obtained in hepatocytes under physiologic and pathologic conditions.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are an attractive cell-targeting vehicle for gene delivery. MIDGE (an acronym for Minimalistic, Immunologically Defined Gene Expression) construct is relatively safer than the viral or plasmid expression system as the detrimental eukaryotic and prokaryotic gene and sequences have been eliminated. The objective of this study was to test the ability of the human MSC (hMSC) to deliver the erythropoietin (EPO) gene in a nude mice model following nucleofection using a MIDGE construct. hMSC nucleofected with MIDGE encoding the EPO gene was injected subcutaneously in Matrigel at the dorsal flank of nude mice. Subcutaneous implantation of nucleofected hMSC resulted in increased hemoglobin level with presence of human EPO in the peripheral blood of the injected nude mice in the first two weeks post-implantation compared with the control groups. The basal layer of the hair shaft in the dermal layer was found to be significantly positive for immunohistochemical staining of a human EPO antibody. However, only a few basal layers of the hair shaft were found to be positively stained for CD105. In conclusion, hMSC harboring MIDGE-EPO could deliver and transiently express the EPO gene in the nude mice model. These cells could be localized to the hair follicle and secreted EPO protein might have possible role in hair regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
In flowering plants, formation of the haploid male gametophytes in anthers requires the interaction between reproductive cells and the neighboring somatic cells, yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal the crucial role of a fasciclin glycoprotein, MICROSPORE AND TAPETUM REGULATOR1 (MTR1), in controlling the development of sporophytic and reproductive cells in rice (Oryza sativa). MTR1 is specifically expressed in the male reproductive cells, yet its mutant exhibits defects in both tapetum and microspore development, causing complete male sterility. We also demonstrate that the fasciclin domains, N-glycolation, and N-terminal signal peptide-mediated plasma membrane localization of MTR1 are required for normal anther development and pollen fertility. Our findings show that rice male reproductive cells secrete the MTR1 protein to control the development of reproductive cells and their adjacent somatic cells, thus providing novel insights into the mechanism of plant male reproductive development.

Abstract: Summary
SKN-1/Nrf plays multiple essential roles in development and cellular homeostasis. We demonstrate that SKN-1 executes a specific and appropriate transcriptional response to changes in available nutrients, leading to metabolic adaptation. We isolated gain-of-function (gf) alleles of skn-1, affecting a domain of SKN-1 that binds the transcription factor MXL-3 and the mitochondrial outer membrane protein PGAM-5. These skn-1(gf) mutants perceive a state of starvation even in the presence of plentiful food. The aberrant monitoring of cellular nutritional status leads to an altered survival response in which skn-1(gf) mutants transcriptionally activate genes associated with metabolism, adaptation to starvation, aging, and survival. The triggered starvation response is conserved in mice with constitutively activated Nrf and may contribute to the tumorgenicity associated with activating Nrf mutations in mammalian somatic cells. Our findings delineate an evolutionarily conserved metabolic axis of SKN-1/Nrf, further establishing the complexity of this pathway.

Abstract: Archegozetes longisetosus is a parthenogenetic oribatid mite and a chelicerate model organism. We examined the localisation of processes between vitellogenesis and embryogenesis as well as the anatomy and histology of involved structures by means of light- and electron microscopy. The proximal oviduct is differentiated into an oviductal bulb, exhibiting a strong secretory epithelium. Here, solidification of the egg shell instantaneously occurs upon passing of the egg from the perivitelline space into the oviductal lumen. This is interpreted as an internalised oviposition with the generation boundary being effectively located at the ovary–oviduct transition, rendering the oviducts into functional brood chambers. The parity mode combines elements of oviparity and ovolarviparity with facultative egg retention.

Abstract: Summary
High-affinity antibodies are generated in germinal centers in a process involving mutation and selection of B cells. Information processing in germinal center reactions has been investigated in a number of recent experiments. These have revealed cell migration patterns, asymmetric cell divisions, and cell-cell interaction characteristics, used here to develop a theory of germinal center B cell selection, division, and exit (the LEDA model). According to this model, B cells selected by T follicular helper cells on the basis of successful antigen processing always return to the dark zone for asymmetric division, and acquired antigen is inherited by one daughter cell only. Antigen-retaining B cells differentiate to plasma cells and leave the germinal center through the dark zone. This theory has implications for the functioning of germinal centers because compared to previous models, high-affinity antibodies appear one day earlier and the amount of derived plasma cells is considerably larger.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the MLL-ENL-ERtm oncogene initiates aberrant proliferation of myeloid progenitors. Here, we show induction of a fail-safe mechanism mediated by the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery that results in activation of the ATR/ATM-Chk1/Chk2-p53/p21CIP1 checkpoint and cellular senescence at early stages of cellular transformation caused by a regulatable MLL-ENL-ERtm in mice. Furthermore, we identified the transcription program underlying this intrinsic anticancer barrier, and DDR-induced inflammatory regulators that fine-tune the signaling toward senescence, thereby modulating the fate of MLL-ENL-immortalized cells in a tissue-environment-dependent manner. Our results indicate that DDR is a rate-limiting event for acquisition of stem cell-like properties in MLL-ENL-ERtm-mediated transformation, as experimental inhibition of the barrier accelerated the transition to immature cell states and acute leukemia development.

Abstract: Summary
Twist proteins have been shown to contribute to cancer development and progression by impinging on different regulatory pathways, but their mechanism of action is poorly defined. By investigating the role of Twist in sarcomas, we found that Twist1 acts as a mechanism alternative to TP53 mutation and MDM2 overexpression to inactivate p53 in mesenchymal tumors. We provide evidence that Twist1 binds p53 C terminus through the Twist box. This interaction hinders key posttranslational modifications of p53 and facilitates its MDM2-mediated degradation. Our study suggests the existence of a Twist box code of p53 inactivation and provides the proof of principle that targeting the Twist box:p53 interaction might offer additional avenues for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Osteocytes that have a dendritic appearance are widely believed to form a complex cellular network system and play crucial roles in mechanotransduction as a principal bone mechanosensor, which is the basis of their neuronallike biology, as previously reported. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and reelin mRNA, which are brain-specific neurogenic markers, have been identified in osteocytes. However, changes in the production of NPY and reelin in response to specific biochemical stimulation are unknown. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effect of corticosterone, one of the endogenous glucocorticoids, on the expression of NPY and reelin in the MLO-Y4 osteocyte cell line. Cells were treated with corticosterone at different concentrations (10-9 M-10-5 M) for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. As revealed, corticosterone reduced the MLO-Y4 cell viability and proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner based on an MTT assay and a Vi-CELL analyzer. The cells were then incubated with corticosterone (10-6 μM), and the NPY and reelin expression levels were detected at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. These results demonstrated that at the gene and the protein levels, corticosterone significantly upregulated the NPY and reelin expression in a time-dependent manner. The application of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, reversed the reduced cell viability and the increased expression of NPY and reelin that were caused by corticosterone. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to verify that corticosterone regulates the NPY and reelin expression in osteocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Many RNA-binding proteins contain multiple single-strand nucleic acid-binding domains and assemble into large multiprotein messenger ribonucleic acid protein (mRNP) complexes. The mechanisms underlying the self-assembly of these complexes are largely unknown. In eukaryotes, the association of the translation factors polyadenylate-binding protein-1 (PABP) and eIF4G is essential for high-level expression of polyadenylated mRNAs. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex poly(A)11·PABP(1–190)·eIF4G(178–203) at 2.0 Å resolution. Our NMR and crystallographic data show that eIF4G interacts with the RRM2 domain of PABP. Analysis of the interaction by small-angle X-ray scattering, isothermal titration calorimetry, and electromobility shift assays reveals that this interaction is allosterically regulated by poly(A) binding to PABP. Furthermore, we have confirmed the importance of poly(A) for the endogenous PABP and eIF4G interaction in immunoprecipitation experiments using HeLa cell extracts. Our findings reveal interdomain allostery as a mechanism for cooperative assembly of RNP complexes.

Abstract: Plants express resistance (R) genes to recognize invaders and prevent the spread of pathogens. To analyze nucleotide binding site, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) genes, we constructed a fast pipeline to predict and classify the R gene analogs (RGAs) by applying in-house matrices. With predicted ~37,000 RGAs, we can directly compare RGA contents across entire plant lineages, from green algae to flowering plants. We focused on the highly divergent NB-LRRs in land plants following the emergence of mosses. We identified entire loss of Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor, NB-LRR (TNL) in Poaceae family of monocots and interestingly from Mimulus guttatus (a dicot), which leads to the possibility of species-specific TNL loss in other sequenced flowering plants. Using RGA maps, we have elucidated a positive correlation between the cluster sizes of NB-LRRs and their numbers. The cluster members were observed to consist of the same class of NB-LRRs or their variants, which were probably generated from a single locus for an R gene. Our website (http://sol.kribb.re.kr/PRGA/), called plant resistance gene analog (PRGA), provides useful information, such as RGA annotations, tools for predicting RGAs, and analyzing domain profiles. Therefore, PRGA provides new insights into R-gene evolution and is useful in applying RGA as markers in breeding and or systematic studies.

Abstract: Summary
The embryonic body plan is established through positive and negative control of various signaling cascades. Late endosomes and lysosomes are thought to terminate signal transduction by compartmentalizing the signaling molecules; however, their roles in embryogenesis remain poorly understood. We showed here that the endocytic pathway participates in the developmental program by regulating the signaling activity. We modified the mouse Vam2 (mVam2) locus encoding a regulator of membrane trafficking. mVam2-deficient cells exhibited abnormally fragmented late endosomal compartments. The mutant cells could terminate signaling after the removal of the growth factors including TGF-β and EGF, except BMP-Smad1/Smad5 signaling. mVam2-deficient embryos exhibited ectopic activation of BMP signaling and disorganization of embryo patterning. We found that mVam2, which interacts with BMP type I receptor, is required for the spatiotemporal modulation of BMP signaling, via sequestration of the receptor complex in the late stages of the endocytic pathway.

Abstract: Regulated exocytosis, which involves fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, is an important mode of communication between cells. In this process, signalling molecules that are stored in secretory vesicles are released into the extracellular space. During the initial stage of fusion, the interior of the vesicle is connected to the exterior of the cell with a narrow, channel-like structure: the fusion pore. It was long believed that the fusion pore is a short-lived intermediate state leading irreversibly to fusion pore dilation. However, recent results show that the diameter of the fusion pore can fluctuate, suggesting that the fusion pore is a subject of stabilization. A possible mechanism is addressed in this article, involving the local anisotropicity of membrane constituents that can stabilize the fusion pore. The molecular nature of such a stable fusion pore to predict how interacting molecules (proteins and/or lipids) mediate changes that affect the stability of the fusion pore and exocytosis is also considered. The fusion pore likely attains stability via multiple mechanisms, which include the shape of the lipid and protein membrane constituents and the interactions between them.

Abstract: Stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism by Ca2+ is now generally recognised as important for the control of cellular ATP homeostasis. Here, we review the mechanisms through which Ca2+ regulates mitochondrial ATP synthesis. We focus on cardiac myocytes and pancreatic β-cells, where tight control of this process is likely to play an important role in the response to rapid changes in workload and to nutrient stimulation, respectively. We also describe a novel approach for imaging the Ca2+-dependent regulation of ATP levels dynamically in single cells.

Abstract: This paper describes the ultrastructure of the male gamete of Glossobothrium sp. (Bothriocephalidea: Triaenophoridae). The mature spermatozoon of Glossobothrium sp. is filiform and possesses two axonemes, a single helicoidal crested body, a parallel nucleus, parallel cortical microtubules and granules of glycogen. In Glossobothrium sp. we describe for first time a 200–250nm thick crest-like body in the Bothriocephalidean. The anterior part of the spermatozoon exhibits a ring of 27 electron-dense cortical microtubules encircling the first axoneme. This structure persists until the appearance of the second axoneme. When the ring of electron-dense cortical microtubules disappears, the spermatozoon exhibits two bundles of thin cortical microtubules. The posterior part of the spermatozoon contains the posterior extremity of the second axoneme, the posterior extremity of the nucleus and few cortical microtubules. Soon nucleus disappears and the axoneme is disorganized. Thus the posterior extremity of the spermatozoon of Glossobothrium sp. exhibits only singlets produced by the disorganization of the doublets of the second axoneme and few cortical microtubules. This type of posterior extremity of the mature spermatozoon has never been described previously in the Triaenophoridae.

Abstract: Ca2+-dependent transmitter release is the most important signaling mechanism for fast information transfer between neurons. Transmitter release takes places at highly specialized active zones with sub-micrometer dimension, which contain the molecular machinery for vesicle docking and -fusion, as well as a high density of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. In the absence of direct evidence for the ultrastructural localization of Ca2+ channels at CNS synapses, important insights into Ca2+ channel–vesicle coupling has come from functional experiments relating presynaptic Ca2+ current and transmitter release, at large and accessible synapses like the calyx of Held. First, high slope values in log–log plots of transmitter release versus presynaptic Ca2+ current indicate that multiple Ca2+ channels are involved in release control of a single vesicle. Second, release kinetics in response to step-like depolarizations revealed fast- and slowly releasable sub-pools of vesicles, FRP and SRP, which, according to the “positional” model, are distinguished by a differential proximity to Ca2+ channels. Considering recent evidence for a rapid conversion of SRP- to FRP vesicles, however, we highlight that multivesicular release events and clearance of vesicle membrane from the active zone must be taken into account when interpreting kinetic release data. We conclude that the careful kinetic analysis of transmitter release at presynaptically accessible and molecularly targeted synapses has the potential to yield important insights into the molecular physiology of transmitter release.

Abstract: Summary
The cohesin complex holds together newly replicated chromatids and is involved in diverse pathways that preserve genome integrity. We show that in budding yeast, cohesin is transiently recruited to active replication origins, and it spreads along DNA as forks progress. When DNA synthesis is impeded, cohesin accumulates at replication sites and is critical for the recovery of stalled forks. Cohesin enrichment at replication forks does not depend on γH2A(X) formation, which differs from its loading requirements at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, cohesin localization is largely reduced in rad50Δ mutants and in cells lacking both Mec1 and Tel1 checkpoint kinases. Interestingly, cohesin loading at replication sites depends on the structural features of Rad50 that are important for bridging sister chromatids, including the CXXC hook domain and the length of the coiled-coil extensions. Together, these data reveal a function for cohesin in the maintenance of genome integrity during S phase.

Abstract: Summary
NAD(P)H:quinone-oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of various quinones using flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor. NQO1 has been also shown to rescue proteins containing intrinsically unstructured domains, such as p53 and p73, from degradation by the 20S proteasome through an unknown mechanism. Here, we studied the nature of interaction between NQO1 and the 20S proteasome. Our study revealed a double negative feedback loop between NQO1 and the 20S proteasome, whereby NQO1 prevents the proteolytic activity of the 20S proteasome and the 20S proteasome degrades the apo form of NQO1. Furthermore, we demonstrate, both in vivo and in vitro, that NQO1 levels are highly dependent on FAD concentration. These observations suggest a link between 20S proteolysis and the metabolic cellular state. More generally, the results may represent a regulatory mechanism by which associated cofactors dictate the stability of proteins, thus coordinating protein levels with the metabolic status.

Abstract: Summary
Proteolytic activity of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein-1 (MALT1) paracaspase is required for survival of the activated B cell subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL). We have identified distinct derivatives of medicinal active phenothiazines, namely mepazine, thioridazine, and promazine, as small molecule inhibitors of the MALT1 protease. These phenothiazines selectively inhibit cleavage activity of recombinant and cellular MALT1 by a noncompetitive mechanism. Consequently, the compounds inhibit anti-apoptotic NF-κB signaling and elicit toxic effects selectively on MALT1-dependent ABC-DLBCL cells in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide a conceptual proof for a clinical application of distinct phenothiazines in the treatment of ABC-DLBCL.

Primitive Erythropoiesis Is Regulated by miR-126 via Nonhematopoietic Vcam-1+ Cells,

Abstract: Summary
Primitive erythropoiesis defines the onset of hematopoiesis in the yolk sac of the early embryo and is initiated by the emergence of progenitors assayed as colony-forming cells (EryP-CFCs). EryP-CFCs are detected for only a narrow window during embryonic development, suggesting that both their initiation and termination are tightly controlled. Using the embryonic stem differentiation system to model primitive erythropoiesis, we found that miR-126 regulates the termination of EryP-CFC development. Analyses of miR-126 null embryos revealed that this miR also regulates EryP-CFCs in vivo. We identified vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (Vcam-1) expressed by a mesenchymal cell population as a relevant target of miR-126. Interaction of EryP-CFCs with Vcam-1 accelerated their maturation to ßh1-globin+ and Ter119+ cells through a Src family kinase. These findings uncover a cell nonautonomous regulatory pathway for primitive erythropoiesis that may provide insight into the mechanism(s) controlling the developmental switch from primitive to definitive hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated inflammation is thought to be a barrier to immune surveillance, particularly in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells are a key feature of cancer inflammation in PDA, but remain poorly understood. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of PDA, we show that tumor-derived granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is necessary and sufficient to drive the development of Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells that suppressed antigen-specific T cells. In vivo, abrogation of tumor-derived GM-CSF inhibited the recruitment of Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells to the tumor microenvironment and blocked tumor development—a finding that was dependent on CD8+ T cells. In humans, PDA tumor cells prominently expressed GM-CSF in vivo. Thus, tumor-derived GM-CSF is an important regulator of inflammation and immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment.

Ubiquitin-Dependent Intramembrane Rhomboid Protease Promotes ERAD of Membrane Proteins,

Abstract: Summary
The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway serves as an important cellular safeguard by directing incorrectly folded and unassembled proteins from the ER to the proteasome. Still, however, little is known about the components mediating ERAD of membrane proteins. Here we show that the evolutionary conserved rhomboid family protein RHBDL4 is a ubiquitin-dependent ER-resident intramembrane protease that is upregulated upon ER stress. RHBDL4 cleaves single-spanning and polytopic membrane proteins with unstable transmembrane helices, leading to their degradation by the canonical ERAD machinery. RHBDL4 specifically binds the AAA+-ATPase p97, suggesting that proteolytic processing and dislocation into the cytosol are functionally linked. The phylogenetic relationship between rhomboids and the ERAD factor derlin suggests that substrates for intramembrane proteolysis and protein dislocation are recruited by a shared mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
In plants, DNA methylation can be mediated by a class of Argonaute4 (AGO4)-associated heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs), through a pathway termed RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). It has been thought that RdDM is solely a nuclear process, as both the biogenesis and functioning of hc-siRNAs take place in the nucleus. In this study, we unexpectedly found that hc-siRNAs are predominantly present in the cytoplasm. We demonstrated that AGO4 is loaded with hc-siRNAs in the cytoplasm and the formation of mature AGO4/siRNA complexes requires HSP90 and the cleavage activity of AGO4. Intriguingly, siRNA binding facilitates the redistribution of AGO4 into the nucleus, likely through inducing conformational change that leads to the exposure of the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Our findings reveal an unsuspected cytoplasmic step in the RdDM pathway. We propose that selective nuclear import of mature AGO4/siRNA complexes is a key regulatory point prior to the effector stage of RdDM.

Tumor Cells Require Thymidylate Kinase to Prevent dUTP Incorporation during DNA Repair,

Abstract: Summary
The synthesis of dTDP is unique because there is a requirement for thymidylate kinase (TMPK). All other dNDPs including dUDP are directly produced by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). We report the binding of TMPK and RNR at sites of DNA damage. In tumor cells, when TMPK function is blocked, dUTP is incorporated during DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Disrupting RNR recruitment to damage sites or reducing the expression of the R2 subunit of RNR prevents the impairment of DNA repair by TMPK intervention, indicating that RNR contributes to dUTP incorporation during DSB repair. We identified a cell-permeable nontoxic inhibitor of TMPK that sensitizes tumor cells to doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic option.

Abstract: Summary
In neurons, transmembrane proteins are targeted to dendrites in vesicles that traffic solely within the somatodendritic compartment. How these vesicles are retained within the somatodendritic domain is unknown. Here, we use a novel pulse-chase system, which allows synchronous release of exogenous transmembrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to follow movements of post-Golgi transport vesicles. Surprisingly, we found that post-Golgi vesicles carrying dendritic proteins were equally likely to enter axons and dendrites. However, once such vesicles entered the axon, they very rarely moved beyond the axon initial segment but instead either halted or reversed direction in an actin and Myosin Va-dependent manner. In contrast, vesicles carrying either an axonal or a nonspecifically localized protein only rarely halted or reversed and instead generally proceeded to the distal axon. Thus, our results are consistent with the axon initial segment behaving as a vesicle filter that mediates the differential trafficking of transport vesicles.

Circadian Dbp Transcription Relies on Highly Dynamic BMAL1-CLOCK Interaction with E Boxes and Requires the Proteasome,

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factors BMAL1 and CLOCK drive the circadian transcription of clock and clock-controlled genes, such as Dbp. To investigate the kinetics of BMAL1 binding to target genes in real time, we generated a cell line harboring tandem arrays of Dbp repeats and monitored the binding of a fluorescent BMAL1 fusion protein to these arrays by time-lapse microscopy. BMAL1 occupancy at the Dbp locus was highly circadian and strictly dependent on CLOCK. Moreover, BMAL1-CLOCK associations with Dbp were extremely unstable and displayed stochastic, proteasome-dependent fluctuations. Proteasome inhibition prolonged the residence time of BMAL1-CLOCK but resulted in an immediate attenuation of Dbp transcription. In cells harboring a single Dbp-luciferase reporter gene copy, this silencing was shown to be caused by a decrease in both the frequencies and sizes of transcriptional bursts. Thus, BMAL1 and CLOCK may act as Kamikaze activators, in that they are rapidly degraded once bound to Dbp chromatin.

Abstract: We recently reported that the efficiency of adenoviral gene delivery and virus stability are significantly enhanced when a proteoliposome (PL) containing apolipoprotein (apo) A-I is used in an animal model. In the current study, we tested tumor removal activity of oncolytic adenovirus (Ad) using PL-containing wildtype (WT) or V156K. Oncolytic Ad with or without PL was injected into tumors of zebrafish and nude mice as a Hep3B tumor xenograft model. The V156K-PL-Ad-injected zebrafish, group showed the lowest tumor tissue volume and nucleic acids in the tumor area, whereas injection of Ad alone did not result in adequate removal of tumor activity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents increased two-fold in tumor-bearing zebrafish; however, the V156K-PL-Ad injected group showed a 40% decrease in ROS levels compared to that in normal zebrafish. After reducing the tumor volume with the V156K-PL-Ad injection, the swimming pattern of the zebrafish changed to be more active and energetic. The oncolytic effect of PL-Ad containing either V156K or WT was about two-fold more enhanced in mice than that of Ad alone 34 days after the injection. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the PL-Ad-injected groups showed enhanced efficiency of viral delivery with elevated Ad-E1A staining and a diminished number of proliferating tumor cells. Thus, the antitumor effect of oncolytic Ad was strongly enhanced by a PL-containing apoA-I and its mutant (V156K) without causing side effects in mice and zebrafish models.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular processes function through multistep pathways that are reliant on the controlled association and disassociation of sequential protein complexes. While dynamic action is critical to propagate and terminate work, the mechanisms used to disassemble biological structures are not fully understood. Here we show that the p23 molecular chaperone initiates disassembly of protein-DNA complexes and that the GCN5 acetyltransferase prolongs the dissociated state through lysine acetylation. By modulating the DNA-bound state, we found that the conserved and essential joint activities of p23 and GCN5 impacted transcription factor activation potential and response time to an environmental cue. Notably, p23 and GCN5 were required to maintain open chromatin regions along the genome, indicating that dynamic protein behavior is a critical feature of various DNA-associated events. Our data support a model in which p23 and GCN5 regulate diverse multistep pathways by controlling the longevity of protein-DNA complexes.

Abstract: Characterization of mucins in the alimentary tract of the grass snake, Natrix natrix was performed by histochemical (PAS, Alcian Blue, pH 2.5 and pH 1.0, sialidase-Alcian Blue, pH 2.5, HID-AB pH 2.5) and lectin-histochemical (WGA, SWGA, PNA, sialidase-PNA, SBA, sialidase-SBA, DBA, sialidase-DBA, ConA, BSI-B4, AAA, UEA-1, LTA) techniques. Oesophageal lining epithelium consisted of ciliated and goblet cells, with no pluricellular glands. Mannosylated sialosulfomucins were observed. Fundic mucosa of stomach presented surface cells producing sialomucins with terminal sialic acid linked to galactose. In gastric glands neck and oxynticopeptic cells were found. Neck cells had sialomucins with mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine and fucose-α-(1,2)-linked residues. Cytoplasm of oxynticopeptic cells showed N-acetylgalactosamine and fucose residues. Secretion of surface cells in pyloric mucosa was similar to that of fundic ones, differing in having fucose. Goblet cells in the small intestine of N. natrix produced sulfo- and sialomucins, with sialic acid linked to galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine residues. Mucins also presented residues of mannose. Goblet cells in the large intestine presented sulfomucins only, with terminal N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose and N-acetylglucosamine. The glycosylation patterns found are probably related to protection against injuries, gastric juice and microorganisms, both pathogenic and decomposers, as well as to dietary adaptations.

Abstract: Summary
Studies on the role of TP53 mutation in breast cancer response to chemotherapy are conflicting. Here, we show that, contrary to dogma, MMTV-Wnt1 mammary tumors with mutant p53 exhibited a superior clinical response compared to tumors with wild-type p53. Doxorubicin-treated p53 mutant tumors failed to arrest proliferation, leading to abnormal mitoses and cell death, whereas p53 wild-type tumors arrested, avoiding mitotic catastrophe. Senescent tumor cells persisted, secreting senescence-associated cytokines exhibiting autocrine/paracrine activity and mitogenic potential. Wild-type p53 still mediated arrest and inhibited drug response even in the context of heterozygous p53 point mutations or absence of p21. Thus, we show that wild-type p53 activity hinders chemotherapy response and demonstrate the need to reassess the paradigm for p53 in cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Variability in signaling pathway activation between neighboring epithelial cells can arise from local differences in the microenvironment, noisy gene expression, or acquired genetic changes. To investigate the consequences of this cell-to-cell variability in signaling pathway activation on coordinated multicellular processes such as morphogenesis, we use DNA-programmed assembly to construct three-dimensional MCF10A microtissues that are mosaic for low-level expression of activated H-Ras. We find two emergent behaviors in mosaic microtissues: cells with activated H-Ras are basally extruded or lead motile multicellular protrusions that direct the collective motility of their wild-type neighbors. Remarkably, these behaviors are not observed in homogeneous microtissues in which all cells express the activated Ras protein, indicating that heterogeneity in Ras activity, rather than the total amount of Ras activity, is critical for these processes. Our results directly demonstrate that cell-to-cell variability in pathway activation within local populations of epithelial cells can drive emergent behaviors during epithelial morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
XBP1 is a key regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. XBP1 ablation in liver causes profound hypolipidemia in mice, highlighting its critical role in lipid metabolism. XBP1 deficiency triggers feedback activation of its upstream enzyme IRE1α, instigating regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of cytosolic mRNAs. Here, we identify RIDD as a crucial control mechanism of lipid homeostasis. Suppression of RIDD by RNA interference or genetic ablation of IRE1α reversed hypolipidemia in XBP1-deficient mice. Comprehensive microarray analysis of XBP1 and/or IRE1α-deficient liver identified genes involved in lipogenesis and lipoprotein metabolism as RIDD substrates, which might contribute to the suppression of plasma lipid levels by activated IRE1α. Ablation of XBP1 ameliorated hepatosteatosis, liver damage, and hypercholesterolemia in dyslipidemic animal models, suggesting that direct targeting of either IRE1α or XBP1 might be a feasible strategy to treat dyslipidemias.

Abstract: Summary
We report a function of human mRNA decapping factors in control of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Decapping proteins Edc3, Dcp1a, and Dcp2 and the termination factor TTF2 coimmunoprecipitate with Xrn2, the nuclear 5′–3′ exonuclease “torpedo” that facilitates transcription termination at the 3′ ends of genes. Dcp1a, Xrn2, and TTF2 localize near transcription start sites (TSSs) by ChIP-seq. At genes with 5′ peaks of paused pol II, knockdown of decapping or termination factors Xrn2 and TTF2 shifted polymerase away from the TSS toward upstream and downstream distal positions. This redistribution of pol II is similar in magnitude to that caused by depletion of the elongation factor Spt5. We propose that coupled decapping of nascent transcripts and premature termination by the “torpedo” mechanism is a widespread mechanism that limits bidirectional pol II elongation. Regulated cotranscriptional decapping near promoter-proximal pause sites followed by premature termination could control productive pol II elongation.

Abstract: Summary
Polymorphic adhesion molecules neurexin and neuroligin (NL) mediate asymmetric trans-synaptic adhesion, which is crucial for synapse development and function. It is not known whether or how individual synapse function is controlled by the interactions between variants and isoforms of these molecules with differing ectodomain regions. At a physiological concentration of Ca2+, the ectodomain complex of neurexin-1 β isoform (Nrx1β) and NL1 spontaneously assembled into crystals of a lateral sheet-like superstructure topologically compatible with transcellular adhesion. Correlative light-electron microscopy confirmed extracellular sheet formation at the junctions between Nrx1β- and NL1-expressing non-neuronal cells, mimicking the close, parallel synaptic membrane apposition. The same NL1-expressing cells, however, did not form this higher-order architecture with cells expressing the much longer neurexin-1 α isoform, suggesting a functional discrimination mechanism between synaptic contacts made by different isoforms of neurexin variants.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors constitute a first line of defense against invading bacteria. X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis (XIAP) is implicated in the control of bacterial infections, and mutations in XIAP are causally linked to immunodeficiency in X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type-2 (XLP-2). Here, we demonstrate that the RING domain of XIAP is essential for NOD2 signaling and that XIAP contributes to exacerbation of inflammation-induced hepatitis in experimental mice. We find that XIAP ubiquitylates RIPK2 and recruits the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) to NOD2. We further show that LUBAC activity is required for efficient NF-κB activation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines after NOD2 stimulation. Remarkably, XLP-2-derived XIAP variants have impaired ubiquitin ligase activity, fail to ubiquitylate RIPK2, and cannot facilitate NOD2 signaling. We conclude that XIAP and LUBAC constitute essential ubiquitin ligases in NOD2-mediated inflammatory signaling and propose that deregulation of NOD2 signaling contributes to XLP-2 pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells typically exhibit aberrant DNA methylation patterns that can drive malignant transformation. Whether cancer cells are dependent on these abnormal epigenetic modifications remains elusive. We used experimental and bioinformatic approaches to unveil genomic regions that require DNA methylation for survival of cancer cells. First, we surveyed the residual DNA methylation profiles in cancer cells with highly impaired DNA methyltransferases. Then, we clustered these profiles according to their DNA methylation status in primary normal and tumor tissues. Finally, we used gene expression meta-analysis to identify regions that are dependent on DNA methylation-mediated gene silencing. We further showed experimentally that these genes must be silenced by DNA methylation for cancer cell survival, suggesting these are key epigenetic events associated with tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is initiated at primary cilia by the ligand-triggered accumulation of Smoothened (Smo) in the ciliary membrane. The underlying biochemical mechanisms remain unknown. We find that Hh agonists promote the association between Smo and Evc2, a ciliary protein that is defective in two human ciliopathies. The formation of the Smo-Evc2 complex is under strict spatial control, being restricted to a distinct ciliary compartment, the EvC zone. Mutant Evc2 proteins that localize in cilia but are displaced from the EvC zone are dominant inhibitors of Hh signaling. Disabling Evc2 function blocks Hh signaling at a specific step between Smo and the downstream regulators protein kinase A and Suppressor of Fused, preventing activation of the Gli transcription factors. Our data suggest that the Smo-Evc2 signaling complex at the EvC zone is required for Hh signal transmission and elucidate the molecular basis of two human ciliopathies.

Abstract: RANKL induces the formation of osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone resorption. Herein we investigate the role of the transmembrane adaptor proteins in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. LAT positively regulates osteoclast differentiation and is up-regulated by RANKL via c-Fos and NFATc1, whereas LAB and LIME act as negative modulators of osteoclastogenesis. In addition, silencing of LAT by RNA interference or overexpression of a LAT dominant negative in bone marrow-derived macrophage cells attenuates RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. Furthermore, LAT is involved in RANKL-induced PLCγ activation and NFATc1 induction. Thus, our data suggest that LAT acts as a positive regulator of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis.

Abstract: Since the 1970s, much effort was been expended researching mechanisms of regulated exocytosis. Early work focused mainly on the role of proteins. Most notably the discovery of SNARE proteins in the 1980s and the zippering hypothesis brought us much closer to understanding the complex interactions in membrane fusion between vesicle and plasma membranes, a pivotal component of regulated exocytosis. However, most likely due to the predictions of the Singer–Nicholson fluid mosaic membrane model, the lipid components of the exocytotic machinery remained largely overlooked. Lipids were considered passive constituents of cellular membranes, not contributing much, if anything, to the process of exocytosis and membrane fusion. Since the 1990s, this so-called proteocentric view has been gradually giving way to the new perspective best described with the term proteolipidic. Many lipids were found to be of great importance in the regulation of exocytosis. Here we highlight the role of cholesterol. Furthermore, by using high-resolution cell-attached membrane capacitance measurements, we have monitored unitary exocytotic events in cholesterol-depleted membranes. We show that the frequency of these events is attenuated, providing evidence at the single vesicle level that cholesterol directly influences the merger of the vesicle and the plasma membranes.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) and histone octamers are two abundant classes of DNA binding proteins that coordinate the transcriptional program in cells. Detailed studies of individual TFs have shown that TFs bind to nucleosome-occluded DNA sequences and induce nucleosome disruption/repositioning, while recent global studies suggest this is not the only mechanism used by all TFs. We have analyzed to what extent the intrinsic DNA binding preferences of TFs and histones play a role in determining nucleosome occupancy, in addition to nonintrinsic factors such as the enzymatic activity of chromatin remodelers. The majority of TFs in budding yeast have an intrinsic sequence preference overlapping with nucleosomal histones. TFs with intrinsic DNA binding properties highly correlated with those of histones tend to be associated with gene activation and might compete with histones to bind to genomic DNA. Consistent with this, we show that activators induce more nucleosome disruption upon transcriptional activation than repressors.

Abstract: Summary
Increased translocation of intestinal bacteria is a hallmark of chronic liver disease and contributes to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Here we tested the hypothesis that the intestinal microbiota and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a long-term consequence of chronic liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Hepatocarcinogenesis in chronically injured livers depended on the intestinal microbiota and TLR4 activation in non-bone-marrow-derived resident liver cells. TLR4 and the intestinal microbiota were not required for HCC initiation but for HCC promotion, mediating increased proliferation, expression of the hepatomitogen epiregulin, and prevention of apoptosis. Gut sterilization restricted to late stages of hepatocarcinogenesis reduced HCC, suggesting that the intestinal microbiota and TLR4 represent therapeutic targets for HCC prevention in advanced liver disease.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin dynamics play a central role in maintaining genome integrity, but how this is achieved remains largely unknown. Here, we report that microrchidia CW-type zinc finger 2 (MORC2), an uncharacterized protein with a derived PHD finger domain and a conserved GHKL-type ATPase module, is a physiological substrate of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), an important integrator of extracellular signals and nuclear processes. Following DNA damage, MORC2 is phosphorylated on serine 739 in a PAK1-dependent manner, and phosphorylated MORC2 regulates its DNA-dependent ATPase activity to facilitate chromatin remodeling. Moreover, MORC2 associates with chromatin and promotes gamma-H2AX induction in a PAK1 phosphorylation-dependent manner. Consequently, cells expressing MORC2-S739A mutation displayed a reduction in DNA repair efficiency and were hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agent. These findings suggest that the PAK1-MORC2 axis is critical for orchestrating the interplay between chromatin dynamics and the maintenance of genomic integrity through sequentially integrating multiple essential enzymatic processes.

Abstract: Summary
Obstacles in elucidating the role of oxidative stress in aging include difficulties in (1) tracking in vivo oxidants, in (2) identifying affected proteins, and in (3) correlating changes in oxidant levels with life span. Here, we used quantitative redox proteomics to determine the onset and the cellular targets of oxidative stress during Caenorhabditis elegans’ life span. In parallel, we used genetically encoded sensor proteins to determine peroxide levels in live animals in real time. We discovered that C. elegans encounters significant levels of oxidants as early as during larval development. Oxidant levels drop rapidly as animals mature, and reducing conditions prevail throughout the reproductive age, after which age-accompanied protein oxidation sets in. Long-lived daf-2 mutants transition faster to reducing conditions, whereas short-lived daf-16 mutants retain higher oxidant levels throughout their mature life. These results suggest that animals with improved capacity to recover from early oxidative stress have significant advantages later in life.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute proteins are required for the biogenesis of some small RNAs (sRNAs), including the PIWI-interacting RNAs and some microRNAs. How Argonautes mediate maturation of sRNAs independent of their slicer activity is not clear. The maturation of the Neurospora microRNA-like sRNA, milR-1, requires the Argonaute protein QDE-2, Dicer, and QIP. Here, we reconstitute this Argonaute-dependent sRNA biogenesis pathway in vitro and discover that the RNA exosome is also required for milR-1 production. Our results demonstrate that QDE-2 mediates milR-1 maturation by recruiting exosome and QIP and by determining the size of milR-1. The exonuclease QIP first separates the QDE-2-bound pre-milR-1 duplex and then mediates 3′ to 5′ trimming and maturation of pre-milRNA together with exosome using a handover mechanism. In addition, exosome is also important for the decay of sRNAs. Together, our results establish a biochemical mechanism of an Argonaute-dependent sRNA biogenesis pathway and critical roles of exosome in sRNA processing.

Abstract: The BNIPs (BCL2 and adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting proteins) are a subfamily of BCL2 family proteins typically containing a single BCL2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. BNIPs exert important roles in two major degradation processes in cells - apoptosis and autophagy. Although it is known that the function of BNIPs is transcriptionally regulated under hypoxic conditions in tumors, their regulation in the developing brain and neurons following the induction of apoptosis/autophagy is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that three members of the BNIP family, BNIP1, BNIP3 and BNIP3L, are expressed in the developing brain with distinct brain region specificity. BNIP3 mRNA was especially enriched in the entorhinal cortex, raising a possibility that it may have additional biological functions in addition to its apoptotic and autophagic functions. Following starvation-induced autophagy induction, BNIP1 mRNA was selectively increased in cultured neurons. However, the apoptogenic chemical staurosporine failed to modulate the expression of BNIPs, which is in contrast to the marked induction of all BNIPs by glucose-oxygen deprivation. Finally, neonatal nerve axotomy, which triggers apoptosis in motoneurons, selectively enhanced BNIP3 mRNA expression. Collectively, these results suggest that the expression of BNIPs is differentially regulated depending on the stimuli, and BNIPs may exert unique biological functions.

Abstract: Summary
The mitogenic and second-messenger signals that promote cell proliferation often proceed through multienzyme complexes. The kinase-anchoring protein Gravin integrates cAMP and calcium/phospholipid signals at the plasma membrane by sequestering protein kinases A and C with G protein-coupled receptors. In this report we define a role for Gravin as a temporal organizer of phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions during mitosis. Mass spectrometry, molecular, and cellular approaches show that CDK1/Cyclin B1 phosphorylates Gravin on threonine 766 to prime the recruitment of the polo-like kinase Plk1 at defined phases of mitosis. Fluorescent live-cell imaging reveals that cells depleted of Gravin exhibit mitotic defects that include protracted prometaphase and misalignment of chromosomes. Moreover, a Gravin T766A phosphosite mutant that is unable to interact with Plk1 negatively impacts cell proliferation. In situ detection of phospho-T766 Gravin in biopsy sections of human glioblastomas suggests that this phosphorylation event might identify malignant neoplasms.

Abstract: Summary
GATA-1 and its cofactor FOG-1 are required for the differentiation of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. In contrast, mast cell development requires GATA-1 and the absence of FOG-1. Through genome-wide comparison of the chromatin occupancy of GATA-1 and a naturally occurring mutant that cannot bind FOG-1 (GATA-1V205G), we reveal that FOG-1 intricately regulates the chromatin occupancy of GATA-1. We identified GATA1-selective and GATA-1V205G-selective binding sites and show that GATA-1, in the absence of FOG-1, occupies GATA-1V205G-selective sites, but not GATA1-selective sites. By integrating ChIP-seq and gene expression data, we discovered that GATA-1V205G binds and activates mast cell-specific genes via GATA-1V205G-selective sites. We further show that exogenous expression of FOG-1 in mast cells leads to displacement of GATA-1 from mast cell-specific genes and causes their downregulation. Together these findings establish a mechanism of gene regulation whereby a non-DNA binding cofactor directly modulates the occupancy of a transcription factor to control lineage specification.

Abstract: Summary
FOXP3 is a key transcription factor for regulatory T cell function. We report the crystal structure of the FOXP3 coiled-coil domain, through which a loose or transient dimeric association is formed and modulated, accounting for the activity variations introduced by disease-causing mutations or posttranslational modifications. Structure-guided mutagenesis revealed that FOXP3 coiled-coil-mediated homodimerization is essential for Treg function in vitro and in vivo. In particular, we identified human FOXP3 K250 and K252 as key residues for the conformational change and stability of the FOXP3 dimer, which can be regulated by protein posttranslational modifications such as reversible lysine acetylation. These studies provide structural and mechanistic explanations for certain disease-causing mutations in the coiled-coil domain of FOXP3 that are commonly found in IPEX syndrome. Overall, the regulatory machinery involving homooligomerization, acetylation, and heteroassociation has been dissected, defining atomic insights into the biological and pathological characteristics of the FOXP3 complex.

Abstract: Summary
Stromal responses elicited by early stage neoplastic lesions can promote tumor growth. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the early recruitment of stromal cells to sites of neoplasia remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an oncogenic KrasG12D-dependent upregulation of GM-CSF in mouse pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDECs). An enhanced GM-CSF production is also observed in human PanIN lesions. KrasG12D-dependent production of GM-CSF in vivo is required for the recruitment of Gr1+CD11b+ myeloid cells. The suppression of GM-CSF production inhibits the in vivo growth of KrasG12D-PDECs, and, consistent with the role of GM-CSF in Gr1+CD11b+ mobilization, this effect is mediated by CD8+ T cells. These results identify a pathway that links oncogenic activation to the evasion of antitumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Polarized trafficking of adhesion receptors plays a pivotal role in controlling cellular behavior during morphogenesis. Particularly, clathrin-dependent endocytosis of integrins has long been acknowledged as essential for cell migration. However, little is known about the contribution of integrin trafficking to epithelial tissue morphogenesis. Here we show how the transmembrane protein Opo, previously described for its essential role during optic cup folding, plays a fundamental role in this process. Through interaction with the PTB domain of the clathrin adaptors Numb and Numbl via an integrin-like NPxF motif, Opo antagonizes Numb/Numbl function and acts as a negative regulator of integrin endocytosis in vivo. Accordingly, numb/numbl gain-of-function experiments in teleost embryos mimic the retinal malformations observed in opo mutants. We propose that developmental regulator Opo enables polarized integrin localization by modulating Numb/Numbl, thus directing the basal constriction that shapes the vertebrate retina epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Antisense noncoding transcripts, genes-within-genes, and convergent gene pairs are prevalent among eukaryotes. The existence of such transcription units raises the question of what happens when RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) molecules collide head-to-head. Here we use a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches in yeast to show that polymerases transcribing opposite DNA strands cannot bypass each other. RNAPII stops but does not dissociate upon head-to-head collision in vitro, suggesting that opposing polymerases represent insurmountable obstacles for each other. Head-to-head collision in vivo also results in RNAPII stopping, and removal of collided RNAPII from the DNA template can be achieved via ubiquitylation-directed proteolysis. Indeed, in cells lacking efficient RNAPII polyubiquitylation, the half-life of collided polymerases increases, so that they can be detected between convergent genes. These results provide insight into fundamental mechanisms of gene traffic control and point to an unexplored effect of antisense transcription on gene regulation via polymerase collision.

Abstract: Summary
Through alternative polyadenylation, human mRNAs acquire longer or shorter 3′ untranslated regions, the latter typically associated with higher transcript stability and increased protein production. To understand the dynamics of polyadenylation site usage, we performed transcriptome-wide mapping of both binding sites of 3′ end processing factors CPSF-160, CPSF-100, CPSF-73, CPSF-30, Fip1, CstF-64, CstF-64τ, CF Im25, CF Im59, and CF Im68 and 3′ end processing sites in HEK293 cells. We found that although binding sites of these factors generally cluster around the poly(A) sites most frequently used in cleavage, CstF-64/CstF-64τ and CFIm proteins have much higher positional specificity compared to CPSF components. Knockdown of CF Im68 induced a systematic use of proximal polyadenylation sites, indicating that changes in relative abundance of a single 3′ end processing factor can modulate the length of 3′ untranslated regions across the transcriptome and suggesting a mechanism behind the previously observed increase in tumor cell invasiveness upon CF Im68 knockdown.

Abstract: Summary
DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly toxic lesions that stall the replication fork to initiate the repair process during the S phase of vertebrates. Proteins involved in Fanconi anemia (FA), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and translesion synthesis (TS) collaboratively lead to homologous recombination (HR) repair. However, it is not understood how ICL-induced HR repair is carried out and completed. Here, we showed that the replicative helicase-related Mcm family of proteins, Mcm8 and Mcm9, forms a complex required for HR repair induced by ICLs. Chicken DT40 cells lacking MCM8 or MCM9 are viable but highly sensitive to ICL-inducing agents, and exhibit more chromosome aberrations in the presence of mitomycin C compared with wild-type cells. During ICL repair, Mcm8 and Mcm9 form nuclear foci that partly colocalize with Rad51. Mcm8-9 works downstream of the FA and BRCA2/Rad51 pathways, and is required for HR that promotes sister chromatid exchanges, probably as a hexameric ATPase/helicase.

Abstract: Summary
The dramatic telomerase-dependent overelongation of telomeres in cells lacking Taz1 (ortholog of human TRF1/TRF2) or Rap1 implicates these proteins in restraint of telomerase activity. However, the modes by which these proteins regulate telomerase remain mysterious. Here we show that the mechanisms underlying excessive telomerase activity differ markedly between taz1Δ and rap1Δ strains. Despite allowing elevated telomerase access, rap1Δ telomeres are processed and synthesized in a cell-cycle-constrained manner similar to that of wild-type cells. In contrast, taz1Δ telomeres are processed with little cell-cycle dependency and recruit telomerase over an abnormally wide range of cell-cycle stages. Furthermore, although taz1Δ telomeres experience transient attrition mediated by replication fork stalling, this is balanced not only by temporal expansion of the telomerase activity period, but also by markedly increased recruitment of telomerase and its accessory factor Est1, suggesting that stalled forks generate robust substrates for telomerase.

Abstract: Summary
As NAD+ is a rate-limiting cosubstrate for the sirtuin enzymes, its modulation is emerging as a valuable tool to regulate sirtuin function and, consequently, oxidative metabolism. In line with this premise, decreased activity of PARP-1 or CD38—both NAD+ consumers—increases NAD+ bioavailability, resulting in SIRT1 activation and protection against metabolic disease. Here we evaluated whether similar effects could be achieved by increasing the supply of nicotinamide riboside (NR), a recently described natural NAD+ precursor with the ability to increase NAD+ levels, Sir2-dependent gene silencing, and replicative life span in yeast. We show that NR supplementation in mammalian cells and mouse tissues increases NAD+ levels and activates SIRT1 and SIRT3, culminating in enhanced oxidative metabolism and protection against high-fat diet-induced metabolic abnormalities. Consequently, our results indicate that the natural vitamin NR could be used as a nutritional supplement to ameliorate metabolic and age-related disorders characterized by defective mitochondrial function.

Abstract: Summary
The roles of Oct4 and Nanog in maintaining self-renewal and undifferentiated status of adult stem cells are unclear. Here, increase in Oct4 and Nanog expression along with increased proliferation and differentiation potential but decreased spontaneous differentiation were observed in early-passage (E), hypoxic culture (H), and p21 knockdown (p21KD) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) compared to late-passage (L), normoxic culture (N), and scrambled shRNA-overexpressed (Scr) MSCs. Knockdown of Oct4 and Nanog in E, H, and p21KD MSCs decreased proliferation and differentiation potential and enhanced spontaneous differentiation, whereas overexpression of Oct4 and Nanog in L, N, and Scr MSCs increased proliferation and differentiation potential and suppressed spontaneous differentiation. Oct4 and Nanog upregulate Dnmt1 through direct binding to its promoter, thereby leading to the repressed expression of p16 and p21 and genes associated with development and lineage differentiation. These data demonstrate the important roles of Oct4 and Nanog in maintaining MSC properties.

Abstract: Summary
A gene can be said to be insulated from environmental variations if its expression level depends only on its cognate inducers, and not on variations in conditions. We tested the insulation of the lac promoter of E. coli and of synthetic constructs in which the transcription factor CRP acts as either an activator or a repressor, by measuring their input function—their expression as a function of inducers—in different growth conditions. We find that the promoter activities show sizable variation across conditions of 10%–100% (SD/mean). When the promoter is bound to its cognate regulator(s), variation across conditions is smaller than when it is unbound. Thus, mode of regulation affects insulation: activators seem to show better insulation at high expression levels, and repressors at low expression levels. This may explain the Savageau demand rule, in which E. coli genes needed often in the natural environment tend to be regulated by activators, and rarely needed genes by repressors. The present approach can be used to study insulation in other genes and organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of replication initiation sites, termed origins, is a crucial step in understanding genome transmission in any organism. Transcription of the Trypanosoma brucei genome is highly unusual, with each chromosome comprising a few discrete transcription units. To understand how DNA replication occurs in the context of such organization, we have performed genome-wide mapping of the binding sites of the replication initiator ORC1/CDC6 and have identified replication origins, revealing that both localize to the boundaries of the transcription units. A remarkably small number of active origins is seen, whose spacing is greater than in any other eukaryote. We show that replication and transcription in T. brucei have a profound functional overlap, as reducing ORC1/CDC6 levels leads to genome-wide increases in mRNA levels arising from the boundaries of the transcription units. In addition, ORC1/CDC6 loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes, which are critical for host immune evasion.

Abstract: Summary
DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), but its in vivo functions are unknown. Previous work indicates that Deptor is part of the Fob3a quantitative trait locus (QTL) linked to obesity/leanness in mice, with Deptor expression being elevated in white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese animals. This relation is unexpected, considering the positive role of mTOR in adipogenesis. Here, we dissected the Fob3a QTL and show that Deptor is the highest-priority candidate promoting WAT expansion in this model. Consistently, transgenic mice overexpressing DEPTOR accumulate more WAT. Furthermore, in humans, DEPTOR expression in WAT correlates with the degree of obesity. We show that DEPTOR is induced by glucocorticoids during adipogenesis and that its overexpression promotes, while its suppression blocks, adipogenesis. DEPTOR activates the proadipogenic Akt/PKB-PPAR-γ axis by dampening mTORC1-mediated feedback inhibition of insulin signaling. These results establish DEPTOR as a new regulator of adipogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about the dynamics of cancer cell death in response to therapy in the tumor microenvironment. Intravital microscopy of chemotherapy-treated mouse mammary carcinomas allowed us to follow drug distribution, cell death, and tumor-stroma interactions. We observed associations between vascular leakage and response to doxorubicin, including improved response in matrix metalloproteinase-9 null mice that had increased vascular leakage. Furthermore, we observed CCR2-dependent infiltration of myeloid cells after treatment and that Ccr2 null host mice responded better to treatment with doxorubicin or cisplatin. These data show that the microenvironment contributes critically to drug response via regulation of vascular permeability and innate immune cell infiltration. Thus, live imaging can be used to gain insights into drug responses in situ.

Abstract: Summary
Variation in chromatin composition and organization often reflects differences in genome function. Histone variants, for example, replace canonical histones to contribute to regulation of numerous nuclear processes including transcription, DNA repair, and chromosome segregation. Here we focus on H2A.Bbd, a rapidly evolving variant found in mammals but not in invertebrates. We report that in human cells, nucleosomes bearing H2A.Bbd form unconventional chromatin structures enriched within actively transcribed genes and characterized by shorter DNA protection and nucleosome spacing. Analysis of transcriptional profiles from cells depleted for H2A.Bbd demonstrated widespread changes in gene expression with a net downregulation of transcription and disruption of normal mRNA splicing patterns. In particular, we observed changes in exon inclusion rates and increased presence of intronic sequences in mRNA products upon H2A.Bbd depletion. Taken together, our results indicate that H2A.Bbd is involved in formation of a specific chromatin structure that facilitates both transcription and initial mRNA processing.

Abstract: Tiam-1 has been implicated in the development of the central nervous system. However, the in vivo function of Tiam-1 has not been fully determined in the developing mouse brain. In this study, we generated Tiam-1 knockout mice using a Tiam-1 gene-trapped embryonic stem cell line. Insertion of a gene trap vector into a genomic site downstream of exon 5 resulted in a mutant allele encoding a truncated protein fused with the β-geo LacZ gene. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Tiam-1 revealed a significant decrease in Rac activity and cell proliferation. In addition, whole-mount embryonic LacZ expression analysis demonstrated that Tiam-1 is specifically expressed in regions of the developing brain, such as the caudal telencephalon and rostral diencephalon. More importantly, mouse embryos deficient in Tiam-1 gene expression displayed a severe defect in embryonic brain development, including neural tube closure defects or a dramatic decrease in brain size. These findings suggest that embryonic Tiam-1 expression plays a critical role during early brain development in mice.

Abstract: Summary
Active genes in yeast can be targeted to the nuclear periphery through interaction of cis-acting “DNA zip codes” with the nuclear pore complex. We find that genes with identical zip codes cluster together. This clustering was specific; pairs of genes that were targeted to the nuclear periphery by different zip codes did not cluster together. Insertion of two different zip codes (GRS I or GRS III) at an ectopic site induced clustering with endogenous genes that have that zip code. Targeting to the nuclear periphery and interaction with the nuclear pore is a prerequisite for gene clustering, but clustering can be maintained in the nucleoplasm. Finally, we find that the Put3 transcription factor recognizes the GRS I zip code to mediate both targeting to the NPC and interchromosomal clustering. These results suggest that zip-code-mediated clustering of genes at the nuclear periphery influences the three-dimensional arrangement of the yeast genome.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy controls cellular catabolism in diverse eukaryotes and modulates programmed cell death in plants and animals. While studies of the unicellular yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided fundamental insights into the mechanisms of autophagy, the roles of cell death pathways in yeast are less well understood. Here, we describe widespread developmentally programmed nuclear destruction (PND) events that occur during yeast gametogenesis. PND is executed through apoptotic-like DNA fragmentation in coordination with an unusual form of autophagy that is most similar to mammalian lysosomal membrane permeabilization and mega-autophagy, a form of plant autophagic cell death. Undomesticated strains execute gametogenic PND broadly in maturing colonies to the apparent benefit of sibling cells, confirming its prominence during the yeast life cycle. Our results reveal that diverse cell-death-related processes converge during gametogenesis in a microbe distantly related to plants or animals, highlighting gametogenesis as a process during which programmed cell death mechanisms may have evolved.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the widespread importance of RING/U-box E3 ubiquitin ligases in ubiquitin (Ub) signaling, the mechanism by which this class of enzymes facilitates Ub transfer remains enigmatic. Here, we present a structural model for a RING/U-box E3:E2∼Ub complex poised for Ub transfer. The model and additional analyses reveal that E3 binding biases dynamic E2∼Ub ensembles toward closed conformations with enhanced reactivity for substrate lysines. We identify a key hydrogen bond between a highly conserved E3 side chain and an E2 backbone carbonyl, observed in all structures of active RING/U-Box E3/E2 pairs, as the linchpin for allosteric activation of E2∼Ub. The conformational biasing mechanism is generalizable across diverse E2s and RING/U-box E3s, but is not shared by HECT-type E3s. The results provide a structural model for a RING/U-box E3:E2∼Ub ligase complex and identify the long sought-after source of allostery for RING/U-Box activation of E2∼Ub conjugates.

Abstract: Summary
The TOR kinase, which is present in the functionally distinct complexes TORC1 and TORC2, is essential for growth but associated with disease and aging. Elucidation of how TOR influences life span will identify mechanisms of fundamental importance in aging and TOR functions. Here we show that when TORC1 is inhibited genetically in C. elegans, SKN-1/Nrf, and DAF-16/FoxO activate protective genes, and increase stress resistance and longevity. SKN-1 also upregulates TORC1 pathway gene expression in a feedback loop. Rapamycin triggers a similar protective response in C. elegans and mice, but increases worm life span dependent upon SKN-1 and not DAF-16, apparently by interfering with TORC2 along with TORC1. TORC1, TORC2, and insulin/IGF-1-like signaling regulate SKN-1 activity through different mechanisms. We conclude that modulation of SKN-1/Nrf and DAF-16/FoxO may be generally important in the effects of TOR signaling in vivo and that these transcription factors mediate an opposing relationship between growth signals and longevity.

Abstract: Summary
We generated knockout mice for MCM8 and MCM9 and show that deficiency for these genes impairs homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair during gametogenesis and somatic cells cycles. MCM8−/− mice are sterile because spermatocytes are blocked in meiotic prophase I, and females have only arrested primary follicles and frequently develop ovarian tumors. MCM9−/− females also are sterile as ovaries are completely devoid of oocytes. In contrast, MCM9−/− testes produce spermatozoa, albeit in much reduced quantity. Mcm8−/− and Mcm9−/− embryonic fibroblasts show growth defects and chromosomal damage and cannot overcome a transient inhibition of replication fork progression. In these cells, chromatin recruitment of HR factors like Rad51 and RPA is impaired and HR strongly reduced. We further demonstrate that MCM8 and MCM9 form a complex and that they coregulate their stability. Our work uncovers essential functions of MCM8 and MCM9 in HR-mediated DSB repair during gametogenesis, replication fork maintenance, and DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
When unfolded proteins accumulate to irremediably high levels within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), intracellular signaling pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) become hyperactivated to cause programmed cell death. We discovered that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is a critical node in this “terminal UPR.” TXNIP becomes rapidly induced by IRE1α, an ER bifunctional kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase). Hyperactivated IRE1α increases TXNIP mRNA stability by reducing levels of a TXNIP destabilizing microRNA, miR-17. In turn, elevated TXNIP protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, causing procaspase-1 cleavage and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) secretion. Txnip gene deletion reduces pancreatic β cell death during ER stress and suppresses diabetes caused by proinsulin misfolding in the Akita mouse. Finally, small molecule IRE1α RNase inhibitors suppress TXNIP production to block IL-1β secretion. In summary, the IRE1α-TXNIP pathway is used in the terminal UPR to promote sterile inflammation and programmed cell death and may be targeted to develop effective treatments for cell degenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase activation in breast cancer is strongly linked to an invasive disease. The molecular basis of ErbB2-driven invasion is largely unknown. We show that cysteine cathepsins B and L are elevated in ErbB2 positive primary human breast cancer and function as effectors of ErbB2-induced invasion in vitro. We identify Cdc42-binding protein kinase beta, extracellular regulated kinase 2, p21-activated protein kinase 4, and protein kinase C alpha as essential mediators of ErbB2-induced cysteine cathepsin expression and breast cancer cell invasiveness. The identified signaling network activates the transcription of cathepsin B gene (CTSB) via myeloid zinc finger-1 transcription factor that binds to an ErbB2-responsive enhancer element in the first intron of CTSB. This work provides a model system for ErbB2-induced breast cancer cell invasiveness, reveals a signaling network that is crucial for invasion in vitro, and defines a specific role and targets for the identified serine-threonine kinases.

Abstract: Summary
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for maintenance of telomere DNA at linear chromosome ends. The catalytic core of Tetrahymena telomerase comprises a ternary complex of telomerase RNA (TER), telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), and the essential La family protein p65. NMR and crystal structures of p65 C-terminal domain and its complex with stem IV of TER reveal that RNA recognition is achieved by a combination of single- and double-stranded RNA binding, which induces a 105° bend in TER. The domain is a cryptic, atypical RNA recognition motif with a disordered C-terminal extension that forms an α helix in the complex necessary for hierarchical assembly of TERT with p65-TER. This work provides the first structural insight into biogenesis and assembly of TER with a telomerase-specific protein. Additionally, our studies define a structurally homologous domain (xRRM) in genuine La and LARP7 proteins and suggest a general mode of RNA binding for biogenesis of their diverse RNA targets.

Abstract: Summary
The nature and site of tumor-antigen presentation to immune T cells by bone-marrow-derived cells within the tumor microenvironment remains unresolved. We generated a fluorescent mouse model of spontaneous immunoevasive breast cancer and identified a subset of myeloid cells with significant similarity to dendritic cells and macrophages that constitutively ingest tumor-derived proteins and present processed tumor antigens to reactive T cells. Using intravital live imaging, we determined that infiltrating tumor-specific T cells engage in long-lived interactions with these cells, proximal to the tumor. In vitro, these cells capture cytotoxic T cells in signaling-competent conjugates but do not support full activation or sustain cytolysis. The spatiotemporal dynamics revealed here implicate nonproductive interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting cells on the tumor margin.

Abstract: In higher plants, the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis by various factors including light, sugars and hormones is mediated by numerous regulatory factors acting at the transcriptional level. Here, the association between sucrose and the plant hormone, cytokinin, in the presence of light was investigated to elucidate cytokinin signaling cascades leading to the transcriptional activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in Arabidopsis seedlings. We showed that cytokinin enhances anthocyanin content and transcript levels of sugar inducible structural gene UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyl transferase (UF3GT) and regulatory gene PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT 1 (PAP1). Genetic analysis showed that cytokinin signaling modulates sugar-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis through a two-component signaling cascade involving the type-B response regulators ARR1, ARR10 and ARR12 in a redundant manner. Genetic, physiological and molecular biological approaches demonstrated that cytokinin enhancement is partially dependent on phytochrome and cryptochrome downstream component HY5, but mainly on photosynthetic electron transport. Taken together, we suggest that cytokinin acts down-stream of the photosynthetic electron transport chain in which the plastoquinone redox poise is modulated by sugars in a photoreceptor independent manner.

Abstract: Summary
A hallmark of aging is an imbalance between production and clearance of reactive oxygen species and increased levels of oxidatively damaged biomolecules. Herein, we demonstrate that splenic and nodal antigen-presenting cells purified from aging mice accumulate oxidatively modified proteins with side-chain carbonylation, advanced glycation end products, and lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, we show that the endosomal accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins interferes with the efficient processing of exogenous antigens and degradation of macroautophagy-delivered proteins. In support of a causative role for oxidized products in the inefficient immune response, a decrease in oxidative stress improved the adaptive immune response to immunizing antigens. These findings underscore a previously unrecognized negative effect of age-dependent changes in cellular proteostasis on the immune response.

A Rho GTPase Signal Treadmill Backs a Contractile Array,

Abstract: Summary
Contractile arrays of actin filaments (F-actin) and myosin-2 power diverse biological processes. Contractile array formation is stimulated by the Rho GTPases Rho and Cdc42; after assembly, array movement is thought to result from contraction itself. Contractile array movement and GTPase activity were analyzed during cellular wound repair, in which arrays close in association with zones of Rho and Cdc42 activity. Remarkably, contraction suppression prevents translocation of F-actin and myosin-2 without preventing array or zone closure. Closure is driven by an underlying “signal treadmill” in which the GTPases are preferentially activated at the leading edges and preferentially lost from the trailing edges of their zones. Treadmill organization requires myosin-2-powered contraction and F-actin turnover. Thus, directional gradients in Rho GTPase turnover impart directional information to contractile arrays, and proper functioning of these gradients is dependent on both contraction and F-actin turnover.

The LIM Protein Ajuba Restricts the Second Heart Field Progenitor Pool by Regulating Isl1 Activity,

Abstract: Summary
Morphogenesis of the heart requires tight control of cardiac progenitor cell specification, expansion, and differentiation. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling restricts expansion of the second heart field (SHF), serving as an important morphogen in heart development. Here, we identify the LIM domain protein Ajuba as a crucial regulator of the SHF progenitor cell specification and expansion. Ajuba-deficient zebrafish embryos show an increased pool of Isl1+ cardiac progenitors and, subsequently, dramatically increased numbers of cardiomyocytes at the arterial and venous poles. Furthermore, we show that Ajuba binds Isl1, represses its transcriptional activity, and is also required for autorepression of Isl1 expression in an RA-dependent manner. Lack of Ajuba abrogates the RA-dependent restriction of Isl1+ cardiac cells. We conclude that Ajuba plays a central role in regulating the SHF during heart development by linking RA signaling to the function of Isl1, a key transcription factor in cardiac progenitor cells.
