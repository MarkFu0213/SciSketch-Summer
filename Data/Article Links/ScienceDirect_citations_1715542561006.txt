Abstract: Homeotic genes and their genomic organization show remarkable conservation across bilaterians. Consequently, the regulatory mechanisms, which control hox gene expression, are also highly conserved. The crucial presence of conserved GA rich motifs between Hox genes has been previously observed but what factor binds to these is still unknown. Previously we have reported that the vertebrate homologue of Drosophila Trl-GAF preferentially binds to GA rich regions in Evx2-hoxd13 intergenic region of vertebrate HoxD cluster. In this study, we show that the vertebrate-GAF (v-GAF) binds at known cis-regulatory elements in the HoxD complex of zebrafish and mouse. We further used morpholino based knockdown and CRISPR-cas9 knockout technique to deplete the v-GAF in zebrafish. We checked expression of the HoxD genes and found gain of the HoxD4 gene in GAF knockout embryos. Further, we partially rescued the morphological phenotypes in GAF depleted embryos by providing GAF mRNA. Our results show that GAF binds at intergenic regions of the HoxD complex and is important for maintaining the spatial domains of HoxD4 expression during embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp70s comprise a deeply conserved chaperone family that has a central role in maintaining protein homeostasis. In humans, Hsp70 client specificity is provided by 49 different co-factors known as J domain proteins (JDPs). However, the cellular function and client specificity of JDPs have largely remained elusive. We have combined affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to characterize the interactome of all human JDPs and Hsp70s. The resulting network suggests specific functions for many uncharacterized JDPs, and we establish a role of conserved JDPs DNAJC9 and DNAJC27 in histone chaperoning and ciliogenesis, respectively. Unexpectedly, we find that the J domain of DNAJC27 but not of other JDPs can fully replace the function of endogenous DNAJC27, suggesting a previously unappreciated role for J domains themselves in JDP specificity. More broadly, our work expands the role of the Hsp70-regulated proteostasis network and provides a platform for further discovery of JDP-dependent functions.

Abstract: Summary
ARH3/ADPRHL2 and PARG are the primary enzymes reversing ADP-ribosylation in vertebrates, yet their functions in vivo remain unclear. ARH3 is the only hydrolase able to remove serine-linked mono(ADP-ribose) (MAR) but is much less efficient than PARG against poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains in vitro. Here, by using ARH3-deficient cells, we demonstrate that endogenous MARylation persists on chromatin throughout the cell cycle, including mitosis, and is surprisingly well tolerated. Conversely, persistent PARylation is highly toxic and has distinct physiological effects, in particular on active transcription histone marks such as H3K9ac and H3K27ac. Furthermore, we reveal a synthetic lethal interaction between ARH3 and PARG and identify loss of ARH3 as a mechanism of PARP inhibitor resistance, both of which can be exploited in cancer therapy. Finally, we extend our findings to neurodegeneration, suggesting that patients with inherited ARH3 deficiency suffer from stress-induced pathogenic increase in PARylation that can be mitigated by PARP inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Individual organ development must be temporally coordinated with development of the rest of the organism. As a result, cell division cycles in a developing organ occur on a relatively fixed timescale. Despite this, many developing organs can regenerate cells lost to injury. How organs regenerate within the time constraints of organism development remains unclear. Here, we show that the developing Drosophila hindgut regenerates by accelerating the mitotic cell cycle. This process is achieved by decreasing G1 length and requires the JAK/STAT ligand unpaired-3. Mitotic capacity is then terminated by the steroid hormone ecdysone receptor and the Sox transcription factor Dichaete. These two factors converge on regulation of a hindgut-specific enhancer of fizzy-related, a negative regulator of mitotic cyclins. Our findings reveal how the cell-cycle machinery and cytokine signaling can be adapted to accomplish developmental organ regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle experiences a decline in lean mass and regenerative potential with age, in part due to intrinsic changes in progenitor cells. However, it remains unclear how age-related changes in progenitors manifest across a differentiation trajectory. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on muscle mononuclear cells from young and aged mice and profile muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and fibro-adipose progenitors (FAPs) after differentiation. Differentiation increases the magnitude of age-related change in MuSCs and FAPs, but it also masks a subset of age-related changes present in progenitors. Using a dynamical systems approach and RNA velocity, we find that aged MuSCs follow the same differentiation trajectory as young cells but stall in differentiation near a commitment decision. Our results suggest that differentiation reveals latent features of aging and that fate commitment decisions are delayed in aged myogenic cells in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
The ATPase p97 is a central component of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system. p97 uses its ATPase activity and co-factors to extract ubiquitinated substrates from different cellular locations, including DNA lesions, thereby regulating DNA repair pathway choice. Here, we find that p97 physically and functionally interacts with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex on chromatin and that inactivation of p97 blocks the disassembly of the MRN complex from the sites of DNA damage upon ionizing radiation (IR). The inhibition of p97 function results in excessive 5′-DNA end resection mediated by MRE11 that leads to defective DNA repair and radiosensitivity. In addition, p97 inhibition by the specific small-molecule inhibitor CB-5083 increases tumor cell killing following IR both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, this is mediated via increased MRE11 nuclease accumulation. This suggests that p97 inhibitors might be exploited to improve outcomes for radiotherapy patients.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages play pivotal roles in immunity, hematopoiesis, and tissue homeostasis. In mammals, macrophages have been shown to originate from yolk-sac-derived erythro-myeloid progenitors and aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM)-derived hematopoietic stem cells. However, whether macrophages can arise from other embryonic sites remains unclear. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we profile the transcriptional landscape of mouse fetal placental hematopoiesis. We uncover and experimentally validate that a CD44+ subpopulation of placental endothelial cells (ECs) exhibits hemogenic potential. Importantly, lineage tracing using the newly generated Hoxa13 reporter line shows that Hoxa13-labeled ECs can produce placental macrophages, named Hofbauer cell (HBC)-like cells. Furthermore, we identify two subtypes of HBC-like cells, and cell-cell interaction analysis identifies their potential roles in angiogenesis and antigen presentation, separately. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of placental hematopoiesis and highlights the placenta as a source of macrophages, which has important implications for both basic and translational research.

Abstract: Summary
The major cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), an ancient protein required for translation of all eukaryotic genomes, is a surprising yet potent oncogenic driver. The genetic interactions that maintain the oncogenic activity of this key translation factor remain unknown. In this study, we carry out a genome-wide CRISPRi screen wherein we identify more than 600 genetic interactions that sustain eIF4E oncogenic activity. Our data show that eIF4E controls the translation of Tfeb, a key executer of the autophagy response. This autophagy survival response is triggered by mitochondrial proteotoxic stress, which allows cancer cell survival. Our screen also reveals a functional interaction between eIF4E and a single anti-apoptotic factor, Bcl-xL, in tumor growth. Furthermore, we show that eIF4E and the exon-junction complex (EJC), which is involved in many steps of RNA metabolism, interact to control the migratory properties of cancer cells. Overall, we uncover several cancer-specific vulnerabilities that provide further resolution of the cancer translatome.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding and eliciting protective immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an urgent priority. To facilitate these objectives, we profile the repertoire of human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II)-bound peptides presented by HLA-DR diverse monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. We identify 209 unique HLA-II-bound peptide sequences, many forming nested sets, which map to sites throughout S including glycosylated regions. Comparison of the glycosylation profile of the S protein to that of the HLA-II-bound S peptides reveals substantial trimming of glycan residues on the latter, likely induced during antigen processing. Our data also highlight the receptor-binding motif in S1 as a HLA-DR-binding peptide-rich region and identify S2-derived peptides with potential for targeting by cross-protective vaccine-elicited responses. Results from this study will aid analysis of CD4+ T cell responses in infected individuals and vaccine recipients and have application in next-generation vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
FXR agonists are used to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in part because they reduce hepatic lipids. Here, we show that FXR activation with the FXR agonist GSK2324 controls hepatic lipids via reduced absorption and selective decreases in fatty acid synthesis. Using comprehensive lipidomic analyses, we show that FXR activation in mice or humans specifically reduces hepatic levels of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFA and PUFA). Decreases in MUFA are due to FXR-dependent repression of Scd1, Dgat2, and Lpin1 expression, which is independent of SHP and SREBP1c. FXR-dependent decreases in PUFAs are mediated by decreases in lipid absorption. Replenishing bile acids in the diet prevented decreased lipid absorption in GSK2324-treated mice, suggesting that FXR reduces absorption via decreased bile acids. We used tissue-specific FXR KO mice to show that hepatic FXR controls lipogenic genes, whereas intestinal FXR controls lipid absorption. Together, our studies establish two distinct pathways by which FXR regulates hepatic lipids.

Abstract: Summary
Modulation of neuronal thresholds is ubiquitous in the brain. Phenomena such as figure-ground segmentation, motion detection, stimulus anticipation, and shifts in attention all involve changes in a neuron’s threshold based on signals from larger scales than its primary inputs. However, this modulation reduces the accuracy with which neurons can represent their primary inputs, creating a mystery as to why threshold modulation is so widespread in the brain. We find that modulation is less detrimental than other forms of neuronal variability and that its negative effects can be nearly completely eliminated if modulation is applied selectively to sparsely responding neurons in a circuit by inhibitory neurons. We verify these predictions in the retina where we find that inhibitory amacrine cells selectively deliver modulation signals to sparsely responding ganglion cell types. Our findings elucidate the central role that inhibitory neurons play in maximizing information transmission under modulation.

Abstract: Summary
Visualizing mRNA in real time in vivo at high resolution is critical for a full understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene regulation and function. Here, using a PP7/PCP-based mRNA-tagging approach, we construct a collection of tissue-specific and differentially expressed toolkit strains for visualizing mRNAs encoding apical, basolateral, and junctional proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans epithelia. We precisely delineate the spatiotemporal organization and dynamics of these transcripts across multiple subcellular compartments and tissues. Remarkably, all the transcripts exhibit an asymmetric, membrane-associated localization during epithelial polarization and maturation, which suggests that mRNA localization is a prerequisite for epithelial polarization and function. Single-particle tracking reveals striking features of the transport dynamics of the mRNAs in a gene-specific, compartment-linked, and time-resolved manner. The toolkit can be used to identify the cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors for mRNA localization. This study provides a valuable resource to investigate complex RNA dynamics in epithelial polarity and morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The M. tuberculosis (Mtb) ClpB is a protein disaggregase that helps to rejuvenate the bacterial cell. DnaK is a protein foldase that can function alone, but it can also bind to the ClpB hexamer to physically couple protein disaggregation with protein refolding, although the molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here, we report the cryo-EM analysis of the Mtb ClpB-DnaK bi-chaperone in the presence of ATPγS and a protein substrate. We observe three ClpB conformations in the presence of DnaK, identify a conserved TGIP loop linking the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain and the nucleotide-binding domain that is important for ClpB function, derive the interface between the regulatory middle domain of the ClpB and the DnaK nucleotide-binding domain, and find that DnaK binding stabilizes, but does not bend or tilt, the ClpB middle domain. We propose a model for the synergistic actions of aggregate dissolution and refolding by the Mtb ClpB-DnaK bi-chaperone system.

Abstract: Store-operated calcium channels are the major player in calcium signaling in non-excitable cells. Store-operated calcium entry is associated with the Orai, stromal interaction molecule (STIM), and transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) protein families. Researchers have provided conflicting data about TRPC1 channel regulation by Orai and STIM. To determine how Orai and STIM influence endogenous TRPC1 pore properties and regulation, we used single channel patch-clamp recordings. Here we showed that knockout or knockdown of Orai1 or Orai3 or overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant Orai1 E106Q did not change the conductance or selectivity of single TRPC1 channels. In addition, these TRPC1 channel properties did not depend on the amount of STIM1 and STIM2 proteins. To study STIM2-mediated regulation of TRPC1 channels, we utilized partial calcium store depletion induced by application of 10 nM thapsigargin (Tg). TRPC1 activation by endogenous STIM2 was greatly decreased in acute extracellular calcium-free experiments. STIM2 overexpression increased both the basal activity and number of silent TRPC1 channels in the plasma membrane. After calcium store depletion, overexpressed STIM2 directly activated TRPC1 in the plasma membrane even without calcium entry in acute experiments. However, this effect was abrogated by co-expression with the non-permeable Orai1 E106Q mutant protein. Taken together, our single-channel patch clamp experiments clearly demonstrated that endogenous TRPC1 forms a channel pore without involving Orai proteins. Calcium entry through Orai triggered TRPC1 channel activation in the plasma membrane, while subsequent STIM2-mediated TRPC1 activity regulation was not dependent on calcium entry.

Abstract: Summary
Repair after traumatic injury often starts with mitotic activation around the lesion edges. Early midline cells in the Drosophila embryonic CNS can enter into division following the traumatic disruption of microtubules. We demonstrate that microtubule disruption activates non-canonical TNF signaling by phosphorylation of TGF-β activated kinase 1 (Tak1) and its target IkappaB kinase (Ik2), culminating in Dorsal/NfkappaB nuclear translocation and Jra/Jun expression. Tak1 and Ik2 are necessary for the damaged-induced divisions. Microtubule disruption caused by Tau accumulation is also reported in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Human Tau expression in Drosophila midline cells is sufficient to induce Tak1 phosphorylation, Dorsal and Jra/Jun expression, and entry into mitosis. Interestingly, activation of Tak1 and Tank binding kinase 1 (Tbk1), the human Ik2 ortholog, and NfkappaB upregulation are observed in AD brains.

Abstract: Summary
The CD8+ T cell response to an antigen is composed of many T cell clones with unique T cell receptors, together forming a heterogeneous repertoire of effector and memory cells. How individual T cell clones contribute to this heterogeneity throughout immune responses remains largely unknown. In this study, we longitudinally track human CD8+ T cell clones expanding in response to yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccination at the single-cell level. We observed a drop in clonal diversity in blood from the acute to memory phase, suggesting that clonal selection shapes the circulating memory repertoire. Clones in the memory phase display biased differentiation trajectories along a gradient from stem cell to terminally differentiated effector memory fates. In secondary responses, YFV- and influenza-specific CD8+ T cell clones are poised to recapitulate skewed differentiation trajectories. Collectively, we show that the sum of distinct clonal phenotypes results in the multifaceted human T cell response to acute viral infections.

Abstract: Summary
Findings about chronic complex diseases are difficult to extrapolate from animal models to humans. We reason that organs may have core network modules that are preserved between species and are predictably altered when homeostasis is disrupted. To test this idea, we perturbed hepatic homeostasis in mice by dietary challenge and compared the liver transcriptome with that in human fatty liver disease and liver cancer. Co-expression module preservation analysis pointed to alterations in immune responses and metabolism (core modules) in both human and mouse datasets. The extent of derailment in core modules was predictive of survival in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) liver cancer dataset. We identified module eigengene quantitative trait loci (module-eQTL) for these predictive co-expression modules, targeting of which may resolve homeostatic perturbations and improve patient outcomes. The framework presented can be used to understand homeostasis at systems levels in pre-clinical models and in humans. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets are important for cancer cell growth and survival. However, the mechanism underlying the initiation of lipid droplet lipolysis is not well understood. We demonstrate here that glucose deprivation induces the binding of choline kinase (CHK) α2 to lipid droplets, which is sequentially mediated by AMPK-dependent CHKα2 S279 phosphorylation and KAT5-dependent CHKα2 K247 acetylation. Importantly, CHKα2 with altered catalytic domain conformation functions as a protein kinase and phosphorylates PLIN2 at Y232 and PLIN3 at Y251. The phosphorylated PLIN2/3 dissociate from lipid droplets and are degraded by Hsc70-mediated autophagy, thereby promoting lipid droplet lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and brain tumor growth. In addition, levels of CHKα2 S279 phosphorylation, CHKα2 K247 acetylation, and PLIN2/3 phosphorylation are positively correlated with one another in human glioblastoma specimens and are associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. These findings underscore the role of CHKα2 as a protein kinase in lipolysis and glioblastoma development.

Abstract: Summary
The clinical use of molecular targeted therapy is rapidly evolving but has primarily focused on genomic alterations. Transcriptomic analysis offers an opportunity to dissect the complexity of tumors, including the tumor microenvironment (TME), a crucial mediator of cancer progression and therapeutic outcome. TME classification by transcriptomic analysis of >10,000 cancer patients identifies four distinct TME subtypes conserved across 20 different cancers. The TME subtypes correlate with patient response to immunotherapy in multiple cancers, with patients possessing immune-favorable TME subtypes benefiting the most from immunotherapy. Thus, the TME subtypes act as a generalized immunotherapy biomarker across many cancer types due to the inclusion of malignant and microenvironment components. A visual tool integrating transcriptomic and genomic data provides a global tumor portrait, describing the tumor framework, mutational load, immune composition, anti-tumor immunity, and immunosuppressive escape mechanisms. Integrative analyses plus visualization may aid in biomarker discovery and the personalization of therapeutic regimens.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factors (TFs) that regulate inducible genes in activated neutrophils are not yet completely characterized. Herein, we show that the genomic distribution of the histone modification H3K27Ac, as well as PU.1 and C/EBPβ, two myeloid-lineage-determining TFs (LDTFs), significantly changes in human neutrophils treated with R848, a ligand of Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8). Interestingly, differentially acetylated and LDTF-marked regions reveal an over-representation of OCT-binding motifs that are selectively bound by OCT2/POU2F2. Analysis of OCT2 genomic distribution in primary neutrophils and of OCT2-depletion in HL-60-differentiated neutrophils proves the requirement for OCT2 in contributing to promote, along with nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1), the TLR8-induced gene expression program in neutrophils. Altogether, our data demonstrate that neutrophils, upon activation via TLR8, profoundly reprogram their chromatin status, ultimately displaying cell-specific, prolonged transcriptome changes. Data also show an unexpected role for OCT2 in amplifying the transcriptional response to TLR8-mediated activation.

Abstract: Summary
Glial pathology is a causal contributor to the striatal neuronal dysfunction of Huntington’s disease (HD). We investigate mutant HTT-associated changes in gene expression by mouse and human striatal astrocytes, as well as in mouse microglia, to identify commonalities in glial pathobiology across species and models. Mouse striatal astrocytes are fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) from R6/2 and zQ175 mice, which respectively express exon1-only or full-length mHTT, and human astrocytes are generated either from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) expressing full-length mHTT or from fetal striatal astrocytes transduced with exon1-only mHTT. Comparison of differential gene expression across these conditions, all with respect to normal HTT controls, reveals cell-type-specific changes in transcription common to both species, yet with differences that distinguish glia expressing truncated mHTT versus full-length mHTT. These data indicate that the differential gene expression of glia expressing truncated mHTT may differ from that of cells expressing full-length mHTT, while identifying a conserved set of dysregulated pathways in HD glia.

Abstract: Summary
Reversible differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays a critical role in vascular biology and disease. Changes in VSMC differentiation correlate with stiffness of the arterial extracellular matrix (ECM), but causal relationships remain unclear. We show that VSMC plasticity is mechanosensitive and that both the de-differentiated and differentiated fates are promoted by the same ECM stiffness. Differential equations developed to model this behavior predicted that a null VSMC state generates the dual fates in response to ECM stiffness. Direct measurements of cellular forces, proliferation, and contractile gene expression validated these predictions and showed that fate outcome is mediated by Rac-Rho homeostasis. Rac, through distinct effects on YAP and TAZ, is required for both fates. Rho drives the contractile state alone, so its level of activity, relative to Rac, drives phenotypic choice. Our results show how the cellular response to a single ECM stiffness generates bi-stability and VSMC plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Persistence of HIV through integration into host DNA in CD4+ T cells presents a major barrier to virus eradication. Viral integration may be curtailed when CD8+ T cells are triggered to kill infected CD4+ T cells through recognition of histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-bound peptides derived from incoming virions. However, this has been reported only in individuals with “beneficial” HLA alleles that are associated with superior HIV control. Through interrogation of the pre-integration immunopeptidome, we obtain proof of early presentation of a virion-derived HLA-A∗02:01-restricted epitope, FLGKIWPSH (FH9), located in Gag Spacer Peptide 2 (SP2). FH9-specific CD8+ T cell responses are detectable in individuals with primary HIV infection and eliminate HIV-infected CD4+ T cells prior to virus production in vitro. Our data show that non-beneficial HLA class I alleles can elicit an effective antiviral response through early presentation of HIV virion-derived epitopes and also demonstrate the importance of SP2 as an immune target.

Abstract: Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a serious ophthalmic disease and characterized by the formation of proliferative membranes by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. In PVR, the contraction and traction of the fibrocellular membranes cause retinal detachment, which can cause reduction surgery for retinal detachment to fail. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) causes RPE cells to form extracellular matrix (ECM), promotes chemotaxis, mitosis, and positively promotes the disease process of PVR. Plumbagin (PLB) is a plant small molecule naphthoquinone compound. It has the functions in anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, inhibit proliferation. We tried to investigate the possible effects of PLB on the biological behavior of ARPE-19 cells induced by FGF-2 and its underlying mechanisms. Our study confirmed that proliferation, migration, and invasion of ARPE-19 cells induced by FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) were significantly inhibited by PLB. PLB also significantly inhibits the expression of MMP-2/-9, collagen I Alpha 1 (Col1A1), collagen IV Alpha 1 (Col4A1), collagen VI Alpha 1 (Col6A1), and the phosphorylation of FGF receptor (FGFR)-1, FGFR-2, ERK, p38, JNK of FGF-2-induced ARPE-19 cells. In summary, PLB inhibits FGF-2-stimulated proliferation, migration, and invasion of ARPE-19 cells, which may take place through inhibiting the expression of MMP-2/-9, Col1A1, Col4A1, Col6A1, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. PLB may have a preventive effect on proliferation, migration, and invasion of FGF-2-induced ARPE-19 cells.

Abstract: Summary
While immune checkpoint blockade is associated with prolonged responses in multiple cancers, most patients still do not benefit from this therapeutic strategy. The Wnt-β-catenin pathway is associated with diminished T cell infiltration; however, activating mutations are rare, implicating a role for autocrine/paracrine Wnt ligand-driven signaling in immune evasion. In this study, we show that proximal mediators of the Wnt signaling pathway are associated with anti-PD-1 resistance, and pharmacologic inhibition of Wnt ligand signaling supports anti-PD-1 efficacy by reversing dendritic cell tolerization and the recruitment of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells in autochthonous tumor models. We further demonstrate that the inhibition of Wnt signaling promotes the development of a tumor microenvironment that is more conducive to favorable responses to checkpoint blockade in cancer patients. These findings support a rationale for Wnt ligand-focused treatment approaches in future immunotherapy clinical trials and suggest a strategy for selecting those tumors more responsive to Wnt inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells integrate signals from multiple molecular pathways to proliferate and differentiate to drive regeneration of the lung alveolus. Utilizing in vivo genetic and ex vivo organoid models, we investigated the role of Fgfr2 signaling in AT2 cells across the lifespan and during adult regeneration after influenza infection. We show that, although dispensable for adult homeostasis, Fgfr2 restricts AT2 cell fate during postnatal lung development. Using an unbiased computational imaging approach, we demonstrate that Fgfr2 promotes AT2 cell proliferation and restrains differentiation in actively regenerating areas after injury. Organoid assays reveal that Fgfr2-deficient AT2 cells remain competent to respond to multiple parallel proliferative inputs. Moreover, genetic blockade of AT2 cell cytokinesis demonstrates that cell division and differentiation are uncoupled during alveolar regeneration. These data reveal that Fgfr2 maintains AT2 cell fate, balancing proliferation and differentiation during lung alveolar regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus plays a role in adaptive brain functions such as memory formation. Adding new neurons to a specific locus of a neural circuit with functional needs is an efficient way to achieve such an adaptive function. However, it is unknown whether neurogenesis is linked to local functional demands potentially specified by the activity of neuronal circuits. By examining the distribution of neurogenesis and different types of neuronal activity in the dentate gyrus of freely moving adult rats, we find that neurogenesis is positionally associated with active excitatory neurons, some of which show place-cell activity, but is positionally dissociated from a type of interneuron with high-burst tendency. Our finding suggests that the behaviorally relevant activity of excitatory-inhibitory neuronal circuits can define a microenvironment stimulating/inhibiting neurogenesis. Such local regulation of neurogenesis may contribute to strategic recruitment of new neurons to modify functionally relevant neural circuits.

Abstract: Summary
53BP1 influences genome stability via two independent mechanisms: (1) regulating DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and (2) enhancing p53 activity. We discovered a protein, Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that associates with the 53BP1 Tudor domain and prevents its recruitment to DSBs. Here, we elucidate how TIRR affects 53BP1 function beyond its recruitment to DSBs and biochemically links the two distinct roles of 53BP1. Loss of TIRR causes an aberrant increase in the gene transactivation function of p53, affecting several p53-mediated cell-fate programs. TIRR inhibits the complex formation between the Tudor domain of 53BP1 and a dimethylated form of p53 (K382me2) that is poised for transcriptional activation of its target genes. TIRR mRNA expression levels negatively correlate with the expression of key p53 target genes in breast and prostate cancers. Further, TIRR loss is selectively not tolerated in p53-proficient tumors. Therefore, we establish that TIRR is an important inhibitor of the 53BP1-p53 complex.

Abstract: Summary
COVID-19 is highly variable in its clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe organ damage and death. We characterized the time-dependent progression of the disease in 139 COVID-19 inpatients by measuring 86 accredited diagnostic parameters, such as blood cell counts and enzyme activities, as well as untargeted plasma proteomes at 687 sampling points. We report an initial spike in a systemic inflammatory response, which is gradually alleviated and followed by a protein signature indicative of tissue repair, metabolic reconstitution, and immunomodulation. We identify prognostic marker signatures for devising risk-adapted treatment strategies and use machine learning to classify therapeutic needs. We show that the machine learning models based on the proteome are transferable to an independent cohort. Our study presents a map linking routinely used clinical diagnostic parameters to plasma proteomes and their dynamics in an infectious disease.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular chaperones assist with protein folding by interacting with nascent polypeptide chains (NCs) during translation. Whether the ribosome can sense chaperone defects and, in response, abort translation of misfolding NCs has not yet been explored. Here we used quantitative proteomics to investigate the ribosome-associated chaperone network in E. coli and the consequences of its dysfunction. Trigger factor and the DnaK (Hsp70) system are the major NC-binding chaperones. HtpG (Hsp90), GroEL, and ClpB contribute increasingly when DnaK is deficient. Surprisingly, misfolding because of defects in co-translational chaperone function or amino acid analog incorporation results in recruitment of the non-canonical release factor RF3. RF3 recognizes aberrant NCs and then moves to the peptidyltransferase site to cooperate with RF2 in mediating chain termination, facilitating clearance by degradation. This function of RF3 reduces the accumulation of misfolded proteins and is critical for proteostasis maintenance and cell survival under conditions of limited chaperone availability.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus whose success as a pathogen relies on its abilities to repurpose host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and to evade antiviral RBPs. To uncover the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome, we here develop a robust ribonucleoprotein (RNP) capture protocol and identify 109 host factors that directly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Applying RNP capture on another coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, revealed evolutionarily conserved interactions between coronaviral RNAs and host proteins. Transcriptome analyses and knockdown experiments delineated 17 antiviral RBPs, including ZC3HAV1, TRIM25, PARP12, and SHFL, and 8 proviral RBPs, such as EIF3D and CSDE1, which are responsible for co-opting multiple steps of the mRNA life cycle. This also led to the identification of LARP1, a downstream target of the mTOR signaling pathway, as an antiviral host factor that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive list of RBPs regulating coronaviral replication and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Summary
The interaction of the human FcγRIIA with immune complexes (ICs) promotes neutrophil activation and thus must be tightly controlled to avoid damage to healthy tissue. Here, we demonstrate that a fungal-derived soluble β-1,3/1,6-glucan binds to the glycosphingolipid long-chain lactosylceramide (LacCer) to reduce FcγRIIA-mediated recruitment to immobilized ICs under flow, a process requiring high-affinity FcγRIIA-immunoglobulin G (IgG) interactions. The inhibition requires Lyn phosphorylation of SHP-1 phosphatase and the FcγRIIA immunotyrosine-activating motif. β-glucan reduces the effective 2D affinity of FcγRIIA for IgG via Lyn and SHP-1 and, in vivo, inhibits FcγRIIA-mediated neutrophil recruitment to intravascular IgG deposited in the kidney glomeruli in a glycosphingolipid- and Lyn-dependent manner. In contrast, β-glucan did not affect FcγR functions that bypass FcγR affinity for IgG. In summary, we have identified a pathway for modulating the 2D affinity of FcγRIIA for ligand that relies on LacCer-Lyn-SHP-1-mediated inhibitory signaling triggered by β-glucan, a previously described activator of innate immunity.

Transcription factor Ascl2 promotes germinal center B cell responses by directly regulating AID transcription,

Abstract: Summary
During germinal center (GC) reactions, activated B cells undergo clonal expansion and functional maturation to produce high-affinity antibodies and differentiate into plasma and memory cells, accompanied with class-switching recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is responsible for both CSR and SHM in GC B cells. Transcriptional mechanisms underlying AID regulation and GC B cell reactions are still not well understood. Here, we show that expression of Ascl2 transcription factor is upregulated in GC B cells. Ectopic expression of Ascl2 promotes GC B cell development and enhances antibody production and affinity maturation. Conversely, deletion of Ascl2 in B cells impairs the GC response. Genome-wide analysis reveals that Ascl2 directly regulates GC B cell-related genes, including AID; ectopic expression of AID in Ascl2-deficient B cells rescues their antibody defects. Thus, Ascl2 regulates AID transcription and promotes GC B cell responses.

Abstract: Summary
During embryo development, tissues often undergo multiple concomitant changes in shape. It is unclear which signaling pathways and cellular mechanisms are responsible for multiple simultaneous tissue shape transformations. We focus on the process of concomitant tissue folding and extension that is key during gastrulation and neurulation. We use the Drosophila embryo as model system and focus on the process of mesoderm invagination. Here, we show that the prospective mesoderm simultaneously folds and extends. We report that mesoderm cells, under the control of anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral gene patterning synergy, establish two sets of adherens junctions at different apical-basal positions with specialized functions: while apical junctions drive apical constriction initiating tissue bending, lateral junctions concomitantly drive polarized cell intercalation, resulting in tissue convergence-extension. Thus, epithelial cells devise multiple specialized junctional sets that drive composite morphogenetic processes under the synergistic control of apparently orthogonal signaling sources.

Abstract: Summary
Despite abundant measurements of bacterial growth rate, cell size, and protein content, we lack a rigorous understanding of what sets the scale of these quantities and when protein abundances should (or should not) depend on growth rate. Here, we estimate the basic requirements and physical constraints on steady-state growth by considering key processes in cellular physiology across a collection of Escherichia coli proteomic data covering ≈4,000 proteins and 36 growth rates. Our analysis suggests that cells are predominantly tuned for the task of cell doubling across a continuum of growth rates; specific processes do not limit growth rate or dictate cell size. We present a model of proteomic regulation as a function of nutrient supply that reconciles observed interdependences between protein synthesis, cell size, and growth rate and propose that a theoretical inability to parallelize ribosomal synthesis places a firm limit on the achievable growth rate. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
As COVID-19 adversely affects patients with cancer, prophylactic strategies are critically needed. Using a validated antibody assay against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we determined a high seroconversion rate (94%) in 200 patients with cancer in New York City that had received full dosing with one of the FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines. On comparison with solid tumors (98%), a significantly lower rate of seroconversion was observed in patients with hematologic malignancies (85%), particularly recipients following highly immunosuppressive therapies such as anti-CD20 therapies (70%) and stem cell transplantation (73%). Patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (97%) or hormonal therapies (100%) demonstrated high seroconversion post vaccination. Patients with prior COVID-19 infection demonstrated higher anti-spike IgG titers post vaccination. Relatively lower IgG titers were observed following vaccination with the adenoviral than with mRNA-based vaccines. These data demonstrate generally high immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination in oncology patients and identify immunosuppressed cohorts that need novel vaccination or passive immunization strategies.

Abstract: Cellular processes are initiated and regulated by different stimuli, including mechanical forces. Cell membrane mechanosensors represent the first step towards the conversion of mechanical stimuli to a biochemical or electrical response. Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels form a growing family of ion gating channels that respond to direct physical force or plasma membrane deformations. A number of calcium (Ca2+) permeable MS channels are known to regulate the initiation, direction, and persistence of cell migration during development and tumour progression. While the evidence that links individual MS ion channels to cell migration is growing, a unified analysis of the molecular mechanisms regulated downstream of MS ion channel activation is lacking. In this review, we describe the MS ion channel families known to regulate cell migration. We discuss the molecular mechanisms that act downstream of MS ion channels with an emphasis on Ca2+ mediated processes. Finally, we propose the future directions and impact of MS ion channel activity in the field of cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Brain neurons arise from relatively few progenitors generating an enormous diversity of neuronal types. Nonetheless, a cardinal feature of mammalian brain neurogenesis is thought to be that excitatory and inhibitory neurons derive from separate, spatially segregated progenitors. Whether bi-potential progenitors with an intrinsic capacity to generate both lineages exist and how such a fate decision may be regulated are unknown. Using cerebellar development as a model, we discover that individual progenitors can give rise to both inhibitory and excitatory lineages. Gradations of Notch activity determine the fates of the progenitors and their daughters. Daughters with the highest levels of Notch activity retain the progenitor fate, while intermediate levels of Notch activity generate inhibitory neurons, and daughters with very low levels of Notch signaling adopt the excitatory fate. Therefore, Notch-mediated binary cell fate choice is a mechanism for regulating the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons from common progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue homeostasis is achieved by balancing stem cell maintenance, cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as the purging of damaged cells. Elimination of unfit cells maintains tissue health; however, the underlying mechanisms driving competitive growth when homeostasis fails, for example, during tumorigenesis, remain largely unresolved. Here, using a Drosophila intestinal model, we find that tumor cells outcompete nearby enterocytes (ECs) by influencing cell adhesion and contractility. This process relies on activating the immune-responsive Relish/NF-κB pathway to induce EC delamination and requires a JNK-dependent transcriptional upregulation of the peptidoglycan recognition protein PGRP-LA. Consequently, in organisms with impaired PGRP-LA function, tumor growth is delayed and lifespan extended. Our study identifies a non-cell-autonomous role for a JNK/PGRP-LA/Relish signaling axis in mediating death of neighboring normal cells to facilitate tumor growth. We propose that intestinal tumors “hijack” innate immune signaling to eliminate enterocytes in order to support their own growth.

Abstract: Summary
Microendoscopic calcium imaging with one-photon miniature microscopes enables unprecedented readout of neural circuit dynamics during active behavior in rodents. In this study, we describe successful application of this technology in the rhesus macaque, demonstrating plug-and-play, head-mounted recordings of cellular-resolution calcium dynamics from large populations of neurons simultaneously in bilateral dorsal premotor cortices during performance of a naturalistic motor reach task. Imaging is stable over several months, allowing us to longitudinally track individual neurons and monitor their relationship to motor behavior over time. We observe neuronal calcium dynamics selective for reach direction, which we could use to decode the animal’s trial-by-trial motor behavior. This work establishes head-mounted microendoscopic calcium imaging in macaques as a powerful approach for studying the neural circuit mechanisms underlying complex and clinically relevant behaviors, and it promises to greatly advance our understanding of human brain function, as well as its dysfunction in neurological disease.

Abstract: Summary
Four potent native human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting distinct epitopes on tetanus toxin (TeNT) are isolated with neutralization potency ranging from approximately 17 mg to 6 mg each that are equivalent to 250 IU of human anti-TeNT immunoglobulin. TT0170 binds fragment B, and TT0069 and TT0155 bind fragment AB. mAb TT0067 binds fragment C and blocks the binding of TeNT to gangliosides. The co-crystal structure of TT0067 with fragment C of TeNT at a 2.0-Å resolution demonstrates that mAb TT0067 directly occupies the W pocket of one of the receptor binding sites on TeNT, resulting in blocking the binding of TeNT to ganglioside on the surface of host cells. This study reveals at the atomic level the mechanism of action by the TeNT neutralizing antibody. The key neutralization epitope on the fragment C of TeNT identified in our work provides the critical information for the development of fragment C of TeNT as a better and safer tetanus vaccine.

Abstract: Summary
Visually guided behaviors depend on the activity of cortical networks receiving visual inputs and transforming these signals to guide appropriate actions. However, non-retinal inputs, carrying motor signals as well as cognitive and attentional modulatory signals, also activate these cortical regions. How these networks integrate coincident signals ensuring reliable visual behaviors is poorly understood. In this study, we observe neural responses in the dorsal-parietal cortex of mice during a visual discrimination task driven by visual stimuli and movements. We find that visual and motor signals interact according to two mechanisms: divisive normalization and separation of responses. Interactions are contextually modulated by the animal’s state of sustained attention, which amplifies visual and motor signals and increases their discriminability in a low-dimensional space of neural activations. These findings reveal computational principles operating in dorsal-parietal networks that enable separation of incoming signals for reliable visually guided behaviors during interactions with the environment.

Abstract: Summary
Mice lacking a microbiota are protected from diet-induced obesity. Previous studies have shown that feeding a Western diet causes hypothalamic inflammation, which in turn can lead to leptin resistance and weight gain. Here, we show that wild-type (WT) mice with depleted gut microbiota, i.e., germ-free (GF) and antibiotic-treated mice, have elevated levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), are protected against diet-induced hypothalamic inflammation, and have enhanced leptin sensitivity when fed a Western diet. Using GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R)-deficient mice and pharmacological inhibition of the GLP-1R in WT mice, we demonstrate that intact GLP-1R signaling is required for preventing hypothalamic inflammation and enhancing leptin sensitivity. Furthermore, we show that astrocytes express the GLP-1R, and deletion of the receptor in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing cells diminished the antibiotic-induced protection against diet-induced hypothalamic inflammation. Collectively, our results suggest that depletion of the gut microbiota attenuates diet-induced hypothalamic inflammation and enhances leptin sensitivity via GLP-1R-dependent mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
In pathogenic mycobacteria, transcriptional responses to antibiotics result in induced antibiotic resistance. WhiB7 belongs to the Actinobacteria-specific family of Fe-S-containing transcription factors and plays a crucial role in inducible antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transcriptional regulatory complexes comprising RNA polymerase σA-holoenzyme, global regulators CarD and RbpA, and WhiB7, bound to a WhiB7-regulated promoter. The structures reveal how WhiB7 interacts with σA-holoenzyme while simultaneously interacting with an AT-rich sequence element via its AT-hook. Evidently, AT-hooks, rare elements in bacteria yet prevalent in eukaryotes, bind to target AT-rich DNA sequences similarly to the nuclear chromosome binding proteins. Unexpectedly, a subset of particles contained a WhiB7-stabilized closed promoter complex, revealing this intermediate’s structure, and we apply kinetic modeling and biochemical assays to rationalize how WhiB7 activates transcription. Altogether, our work presents a comprehensive view of how WhiB7 serves to activate gene expression leading to antibiotic resistance.

Abstract: Summary
While molecules that promote the growth of animal cells have been identified, it remains unclear how such signals are orchestrated to determine a characteristic target size for different cell types. It is increasingly clear that cell size is determined by size checkpoints—mechanisms that restrict the cell cycle progression of cells that are smaller than their target size. Previously, we described a p38 MAPK-dependent cell size checkpoint mechanism whereby p38 is selectively activated and prevents cell cycle progression in cells that are smaller than a given target size. In this study, we show that the specific target size required for inactivation of p38 and transition through the cell cycle is determined by CDK4 activity. Our data suggest a model whereby p38 and CDK4 cooperate analogously to the function of a thermostat: while p38 senses irregularities in size, CDK4 corresponds to the thermostat dial that sets the target size.

Abstract: Summary
Although some cell types may be defined anatomically or by physiological function, a rigorous definition of cell state remains elusive. Here, we develop a quantitative, imaging-based platform for the systematic and automated classification of subcellular organization in single cells. We use this platform to quantify subcellular organization and gene expression in >30,000 individual human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, producing a publicly available dataset that describes the population distributions of local and global sarcomere organization, mRNA abundance, and correlations between these traits. While the mRNA abundance of some phenotypically important genes correlates with subcellular organization (e.g., the beta-myosin heavy chain, MYH7), these two cellular metrics are heterogeneous and often uncorrelated, which suggests that gene expression alone is not sufficient to classify cell states. Instead, we posit that cell state should be defined by observing full distributions of quantitative, multidimensional traits in single cells that also account for space, time, and function.

Abstract: Summary
There is renewed interest in bacterial viruses (phages) as alternatives to antibiotics. All phage treatments to date have used virulent phages rather than temperate ones, as these can integrate into the genome of the bacterial host and lie dormant. However, temperate phages are abundant and easier to isolate. To make use of these entities, we leverage stressors known to awaken these dormant, integrated phages. Co-administration of the temperate phage HK97 with sub-inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin results in bacterial eradication (≥8 log reduction) in vitro. This synergy is mechanistically distinct from phage-antibiotic-synergy described for virulent phages. Instead, the antibiotic specifically selects against bacteria in which the phage has integrated. As the interaction between temperate phages and stressors such as ciprofloxacin are known to be widespread, this approach may be broadly applicable and enable the use of temperate phages to combat bacterial infections.

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of pancreatic β cells. We show here that the protein NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) has a key role in the pathogenesis of mouse and human T1D. More specifically, downregulation of NLRP1 expression occurs during T helper 17 (Th17) differentiation, alongside greater expression of several molecules related to Th17 cell differentiation in a signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent pathway. These changes lead to a consequent increase in interleukin 17 (IL-17) production within the pancreas and higher incidence of diabetes in streptozotocin (STZ)-injected mice. Finally, in patients with T1D and a SNP (rs12150220) in NLRP1, there is a robust decrease in IL-17 levels in serum and in memory Th17 cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results demonstrate that NLRP1 acts as a negative regulator of the Th17 cell polarization program, making it an interesting target for intervention during the early stages of T1D.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants threatens efforts to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has risen steeply, and a SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which interacts with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and constitutes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyze whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 enters two of eight cell lines tested with roughly 50% increased efficiency and is equally inhibited by two entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 is resistant against bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. B.1.617 evades antibodies induced by infection or vaccination, although less so than the B.1.351 variant. Collectively, our study reveals that antibody evasion of B.1.617 may contribute to the rapid spread of this variant.

Abstract: Summary
We lack a mechanistic understanding of aging-mediated changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics and lipid metabolism that affect T cell function. The bioactive sphingolipid ceramide, induced by aging stress, mediates mitophagy and cell death; however, the aging-related roles of ceramide metabolism in regulating T cell function remain unknown. Here, we show that activated T cells isolated from aging mice have elevated C14/C16 ceramide accumulation in mitochondria, generated by ceramide synthase 6, leading to mitophagy/mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, aging-dependent mitochondrial ceramide inhibits protein kinase A, leading to mitophagy in activated T cells. This aging/ceramide-dependent mitophagy attenuates the antitumor functions of T cells in vitro and in vivo. Also, inhibition of ceramide metabolism or PKA activation by genetic and pharmacologic means prevents mitophagy and restores the central memory phenotype in aging T cells. Thus, these studies help explain the mechanisms behind aging-related dysregulation of T cells’ antitumor activity, which can be restored by inhibiting ceramide-dependent mitophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Improving clinical care for individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants is a global health priority. Small-molecule antivirals like remdesivir (RDV) and biologics such as human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is not known whether combination RDV/mAb will improve outcomes over single-agent therapies or whether antibody therapies will remain efficacious against variants. Here, we show that a combination of two mAbs in clinical trials, C144 and C135, have potent antiviral effects against even when initiated 48 h after infection and have therapeutic efficacy in vivo against the B.1.351 variant of concern (VOC). Combining RDV and antibodies provided a modest improvement in outcomes compared with single agents. These data support the continued use of RDV to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections and the continued clinical development of the C144 and C135 antibody combination to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Abstract: Summary
The cyclic AMP pathway promotes melanocyte differentiation by activating CREB and the cAMP-regulated transcription co-activators 1–3 (CRTC1–3). Differentiation is dysregulated in melanomas, although the contributions of CRTC proteins is unclear. We report a selective differentiation impairment in CRTC3 KO melanocytes and melanoma cells, due to downregulation of oculo-cutaneous albinism II (OCA2) and block of melanosome maturation. CRTC3 stimulates OCA2 expression by binding to CREB on a conserved enhancer, a regulatory site for pigmentation and melanoma risk. CRTC3 is uniquely activated by ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser391 and by low levels of cAMP. Phosphorylation at Ser391 is constitutively elevated in human melanoma cells with hyperactivated ERK1/2 signaling; knockout of CRTC3 in this setting impairs anchorage-independent growth, migration, and invasiveness, whereas CRTC3 overexpression supports cell survival in response to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor vemurafenib. As melanomas expressing gain-of-function mutations in CRTC3 are associated with reduced survival, our results suggest that CRTC3 inhibition may provide therapeutic benefit in this setting.

Abstract: Summary
Both genetic predisposition and environmental factors appear to play a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development. Genetic studies in humans have linked the interleukin (IL)-23 signaling pathway with IBD, but the environmental factors contributing to disease have remained elusive. Here, we show that the azo dyes Red 40 and Yellow 6, the most abundant food colorants in the world, can trigger an IBD-like colitis in mice conditionally expressing IL-23, or in two additional animal models in which IL-23 expression was augmented. Increased IL-23 expression led to generation of activated CD4+ T cells that expressed interferon-γ and transferred disease to mice exposed to Red 40. Colitis induction was dependent on the commensal microbiota promoting the azo reduction of Red 40 and generation of a metabolite, 1-amino-2-naphthol-6-sulfonate sodium salt. Together these findings suggest that specific food colorants represent novel risk factors for development of colitis in mice with increased IL-23 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factors T-bet and Eomesodermin (Eomes) regulate CD8 T cell exhaustion through undefined mechanisms. Here, we show that the subcellular localization of T-bet and Eomes dictate their regulatory activity in exhausted T cells (TEXs). TEXs had a higher ratio of nuclear Eomes:T-bet than memory T cells (TMEMs) during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in preclinical cancer models and in human tumors. Biochemically, T-bet and Eomes compete for the same DNA sequences, including the Pdcd1 T-box. High nuclear T-bet strongly represses Pdcd1 transcription in TMEM, whereas low nuclear T-bet in TEX leads to a dominant effect of Eomes that acts as a weaker repressor of Pdcd1. Blocking PD-1 signaling in TEXs increases nuclear T-bet, restoring stronger repression of Pdcd1, and driving T-bet-associated gene expression programs of chemotaxis, homing, and activation. These data identify a mechanism whereby the T-bet-Eomes axis regulates exhaustion through their nuclear localization, providing insights into how these transcription factors regulate TEX biology.

Abstract: Summary
In the early fetal stage, the gonads are bipotent and only later become the ovary or testis, depending on the genetic sex. Despite many studies examining how sex determination occurs from biopotential gonads, the spatial and temporal organization of bipotential gonads and their progenitors is poorly understood. Here, using lineage tracing in mice, we find that the gonads originate from a T+ primitive streak through WT1+ posterior intermediate mesoderm and appear to share origins anteriorly with the adrenal glands and posteriorly with the metanephric mesenchyme. Comparative single-cell transcriptomic analyses in mouse and cynomolgus monkey embryos reveal the convergence of the lineage trajectory and genetic programs accompanying the specification of biopotential gonadal progenitor cells. This process involves sustained expression of epithelial genes and upregulation of mesenchymal genes, thereby conferring an epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid state. Our study provides key resources for understanding early gonadogenesis in mice and primates.

Abstract: Summary
Loss-of-function mutations in proline-rich transmembrane protein-2 (PRRT2) cause paroxysmal disorders associated with defective Ca2+ dependence of glutamatergic transmission. We find that either acute or constitutive PRRT2 deletion induces a significant decrease in the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) that is insensitive to extracellular Ca2+ and associated with a reduced contribution of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels to the EPSC amplitude. This synaptic phenotype parallels a decrease in somatic P/Q-type Ca2+ currents due to a decreased membrane targeting of the channel with unchanged total expression levels. Co-immunoprecipitation, pull-down assays, and proteomics reveal a specific and direct interaction of PRRT2 with P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. At presynaptic terminals lacking PRRT2, P/Q-type Ca2+ channels reduce their clustering at the active zone, with a corresponding decrease in the P/Q-dependent presynaptic Ca2+ signal. The data highlight the central role of PRRT2 in ensuring the physiological Ca2+ sensitivity of the release machinery at glutamatergic synapses.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitous ribosome-associated complex (RAC) is a chaperone that spans ribosomes, making contacts near both the polypeptide exit tunnel and the decoding center, a position prime for sensing and coordinating translation and folding. Loss of RAC is known to result in growth defects and sensitization to translational and osmotic stresses. However, the physiological substrates of RAC and the mechanism(s) by which RAC is involved in responding to specific stresses in higher eukaryotes remain obscure. The data presented here uncover an essential function of mammalian RAC in the unfolded protein response (UPR). Knockdown of RAC sensitizes mammalian cells to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and selectively interferes with IRE1 branch activation. Higher-order oligomerization of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) kinase/endoribonuclease depends upon RAC. These results reveal a surveillance function for RAC in the UPR, as follows: modulating IRE1α clustering as required for endonuclease activation and splicing of the substrate Xbp1 mRNA.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and cell fate decisions are driven by a broad array of molecular signals. While transcriptional regulators have been extensively studied in human ESCs (hESCs), the extent to which RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) contribute to human pluripotency remains unclear. Here, we carry out a proteome-wide screen and identify 810 proteins that bind RNA in hESCs. We reveal that RBPs are preferentially expressed in hESCs and dynamically regulated during early stem cell differentiation. Notably, many RBPs are affected by knockdown of OCT4, a master regulator of pluripotency, several dozen of which are directly targeted by this factor. Using cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP-seq), we find that the pluripotency-associated STAT3 and OCT4 transcription factors interact with RNA in hESCs and confirm the binding of STAT3 to the conserved NORAD long-noncoding RNA. Our findings indicate that RBPs have a more widespread role in human pluripotency than previously appreciated.

Abstract: Summary
Although T cells are likely players in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunity, little is known about the phenotypic features of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associated with recovery from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We analyze T cells from 34 individuals with COVID-19 with severity ranging from mild (outpatient) to critical, culminating in death. Relative to individuals who succumbed, individuals who recovered from severe COVID-19 harbor elevated and increasing numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells capable of homeostatic proliferation. In contrast, fatal COVID-19 cases display elevated numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific regulatory T cells and a time-dependent escalation in activated bystander CXCR4+ T cells, as assessed by longitudinal sampling. Together with the demonstration of increased proportions of inflammatory CXCR4+ T cells in the lungs of individuals with severe COVID-19, these results support a model where lung-homing T cells activated through bystander effects contribute to immunopathology, whereas a robust, non-suppressive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response limits pathogenesis and promotes recovery from severe COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
STING modulates immunity by responding to bacterial and endogenous cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). Humans and mice with STING gain-of-function mutations develop a syndrome known as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), which is characterized by inflammatory or fibrosing lung disease. We hypothesized that hyperresponsiveness of gain-of-function STING to bacterial CDNs might explain autoinflammatory lung disease in SAVI mice. We report that depletion of gut microbes with oral antibiotics (vancomycin, neomycin, and ampicillin [VNA]) nearly eliminates lung disease in SAVI mice, implying that gut microbes might promote STING-associated autoinflammation. However, we show that germ-free SAVI mice still develop severe autoinflammatory disease and that transferring gut microbiota from antibiotics-treated mice to germ-free animals eliminates lung inflammation. Depletion of anaerobes with metronidazole abolishes the protective effect of the VNA antibiotics cocktail, and recolonization with the metronidazole-sensitive anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron prevents disease, confirming a protective role of a metronidazole-sensitive microbe in a model of SAVI.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant energy status contributes to multiple metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that ketogenic-diet-induced changes in energy status enhance the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy by decreasing PD-L1 protein levels and increasing expression of type-I interferon (IFN) and antigen presentation genes. Mechanistically, energy deprivation activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn, phosphorylates PD-L1 on Ser283, thereby disrupting its interaction with CMTM4 and subsequently triggering PD-L1 degradation. In addition, AMPK phosphorylates EZH2, which disrupts PRC2 function, leading to enhanced IFNs and antigen presentation gene expression. Through these mechanisms, AMPK agonists or ketogenic diets enhance the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy and improve the overall survival rate in syngeneic mouse tumor models. Our findings reveal a pivotal role for AMPK in regulating the immune response to immune-checkpoint blockade and advocate for combining ketogenic diets or AMPK agonists with anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy to combat cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor acidosis promotes disease progression through a stimulation of fatty acid (FA) metabolism in cancer cells. Instead of blocking the use of FAs by acidic cancer cells, we examined whether excess uptake of specific FAs could lead to antitumor effects. We found that n-3 but also remarkably n-6 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) selectively induced ferroptosis in cancer cells under ambient acidosis. Upon exceeding buffering capacity of triglyceride storage into lipid droplets, n-3 and n-6 PUFA peroxidation led to cytotoxic effects in proportion to the number of double bonds and even more so in the presence of diacylglycerol acyltransferase inhibitors (DGATi). Finally, an n-3 long-chain PUFA-rich diet significantly delayed mouse tumor growth when compared with a monounsaturated FA-rich diet, an effect further accentuated by administration of DGATi or ferroptosis inducers. These data point out dietary PUFA as a selective adjuvant antitumor modality that may efficiently complement pharmacological approaches.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanism of T cell antigen receptor (TCR-CD3) signaling remains elusive. Here, we identify mutations in the transmembrane region of TCRβ or CD3ζ that augment peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)-induced signaling not explicable by enhanced ligand binding, lateral diffusion, clustering, or co-receptor function. Using a biochemical assay and molecular dynamics simulation, we demonstrate that the gain-of-function mutations loosen the interaction between TCRαβ and CD3ζ. Similar to the activating mutations, pMHC binding reduces TCRαβ cohesion with CD3ζ. This event occurs prior to CD3ζ phosphorylation and at 0°C. Moreover, we demonstrate that soluble monovalent pMHC alone induces signaling and reduces TCRαβ cohesion with CD3ζ in membrane-bound or solubilised TCR-CD3. Our data provide compelling evidence that pMHC binding suffices to activate allosteric changes propagating from TCRαβ to the CD3 subunits, reconfiguring interchain transmembrane region interactions. These dynamic modifications could change the arrangement of TCR-CD3 boundary lipids to license CD3ζ phosphorylation and initiate signal propagation.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication initiates at genomic locations known as origins of replication, which, in S. cerevisiae, share a common DNA consensus motif. Despite being virtually nucleosome-free, origins of replication are greatly influenced by the surrounding chromatin state. Here, we show that histone H3 lysine 37 mono-methylation (H3K37me1) is catalyzed by Set1p and Set2p and that it regulates replication origin licensing. H3K37me1 is uniformly distributed throughout most of the genome, but it is scarce at replication origins, where it increases according to the timing of their firing. We find that H3K37me1 hinders Mcm2 interaction with chromatin, maintaining low levels of MCM outside of conventional replication origins. Lack of H3K37me1 results in defective DNA replication from canonical origins while promoting replication events at inefficient and non-canonical sites. Collectively, our results indicate that H3K37me1 ensures correct execution of the DNA replication program by protecting the genome from inappropriate origin licensing and spurious DNA replication.

Abstract: Summary
Therapy resistance arises from heterogeneous drug-tolerant persister cells or minimal residual disease (MRD) through genetic and nongenetic mechanisms. A key question is whether specific molecular features of the MRD ecosystem determine which of these two distinct trajectories will eventually prevail. We show that, in melanoma exposed to mitogen-activated protein kinase therapeutics, emergence of a transient neural crest stem cell (NCSC) population in MRD concurs with the development of nongenetic resistance. This increase relies on a glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor-dependent signaling cascade, which activates the AKT survival pathway in a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-dependent manner. Ablation of the NCSC population through FAK inhibition delays relapse in patient-derived tumor xenografts. Strikingly, all tumors that ultimately escape this treatment exhibit resistance-conferring genetic alterations and increased sensitivity to extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition. These findings identify an approach that abrogates the nongenetic resistance trajectory in melanoma and demonstrate that the cellular composition of MRD deterministically imposes distinct drug resistance evolutionary paths.

Abstract: Summary
The cell-intrinsic nature of tumor metabolism has become increasingly well characterized. The impact that tumors have on systemic metabolism, however, has received less attention. Here, we used adult zebrafish harboring BRAFV600E-driven melanoma to study the effect of cancer on distant tissues. By applying metabolomics and isotope tracing, we found that melanoma consume ~15 times more glucose than other tissues measured. Despite this burden, circulating glucose levels were maintained in disease animals by a tumor-liver alanine cycle. Excretion of glucose-derived alanine from tumors provided a source of carbon for hepatic gluconeogenesis and allowed tumors to remove excess nitrogen from branched-chain amino acid catabolism, which we found to be activated in zebrafish and human melanoma. Pharmacological inhibition of the tumor-liver alanine cycle in zebrafish reduced tumor burden. Our findings underscore the significance of metabolic crosstalk between tumors and distant tissues and establish the adult zebrafish as an attractive model to study such processes.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) regulate the occurrence of obesity and its related diseases. Here, we found that serine/threonine protein kinase 24 (Stk24) expression is downregulated significantly in ATMs in obese subjects or obese subjects with type 2 diabetes and mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). We further identified that glucolipotoxicity downregulated Stk24 expression in ATMs. Stk24-deficient mice develop severe HFD-induced metabolic disorders and insulin insensitivity. Mechanistically, Stk24 intervenes in NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in ATMs by associating directly with NLRP3, decreasing interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion. Accordingly, Stk24 deficiency in the hematopoietic system promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which contributes to exacerbation of metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are essential for developmental myelination and oligodendrocyte regeneration after CNS injury. These progenitors express calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and form direct synapses with neurons throughout the CNS, but the roles of this signaling are unclear. To enable selective alteration of the properties of AMPARs in oligodendroglia, we generate mice that allow cell-specific overexpression of EGFP-GluA2 in vivo. In healthy conditions, OPC-specific GluA2 overexpression significantly increase their proliferation in an age-dependent manner but did not alter their rate of differentiation into oligodendrocytes. In contrast, after demyelinating brain injury in neonates or adults, higher GluA2 levels promote both OPC proliferation and oligodendrocyte regeneration, but do not prevent injury-induced initial cell loss. These findings indicate that AMPAR GluA2 content regulates the proliferative and regenerative behavior of adult OPCs, serving as a putative target for better myelin repair.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control critical aspects of cardiomyocyte function, but the repertoire of active RBPs in cardiomyocytes during the growth response is largely unknown. We define RBPs in healthy and diseased cardiomyocytes at a system-wide level by RNA interactome capture. This identifies 67 cardiomyocyte-specific RBPs, including several contractile proteins. Furthermore, we identify the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 4 (Cpeb4) as a dynamic RBP, regulating cardiac growth both in vitro and in vivo. We identify mRNAs bound to and regulated by Cpeb4 in cardiomyocytes. Cpeb4 regulates cardiac remodeling by differential expression of transcription factors. Among Cpeb4 target mRNAs, two zinc finger transcription factors (Zeb1 and Zbtb20) are discovered. We show that Cpeb4 regulates the expression of these mRNAs and that Cpeb4 depletion increases their expression. Thus, Cpeb4 emerges as a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte function by differential binding to specific mRNAs in response to pathological growth stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
BAF chromatin remodeling complexes play important roles in chromatin regulation and cancer. Here, we report that Ewing sarcoma cells are dependent on the autocrine signaling mediated by NELL2, a secreted glycoprotein that has been characterized as an axon guidance molecule. NELL2 uses Robo3 as the receptor to transmit critical growth signaling. NELL2 signaling inhibits cdc42 and upregulates BAF complexes and EWS-FLI1 transcriptional output. We demonstrate that cdc42 is a negative regulator of BAF complexes, inducing actin polymerization and complex disassembly. Furthermore, we identify NELL2highCD133highEWS-FLI1high and NELL2lowCD133lowEWS-FLI1low populations in Ewing sarcoma, which display phenotypes consistent with high and low NELL2 signaling, respectively. We show that NELL2, CD133, and EWS-FLI1 positively regulate each other and upregulate BAF complexes and cell proliferation in Ewing sarcoma. These results reveal a signaling pathway regulating critical chromatin remodeling complexes and cancer cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
The human gut microbiome consists of bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. The gut viruses are relatively underexplored. Here, we longitudinally analyzed the gut virome composition in 11 healthy adults: its stability, variation, and the effect of a gluten-free diet. Using viral enrichment and a de novo assembly-based approach, we demonstrate the quantitative dynamics of the gut virome, including dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, and ssRNA viruses. We observe highly divergent individual viral communities, carrying on an average 2,143 viral genomes, 13.1% of which were present at all 3 time points. In contrast to previous reports, the Siphoviridae family dominates over Microviridae in studied individual viromes. We also show individual viromes to be stable at the family level but to vary substantially at the genera and species levels. Finally, we demonstrate that lower initial diversity of the human gut virome leads to a more pronounced effect of the dietary intervention on its composition.

Abstract: Summary
Organoids allow the recapitulation of intestinal homeostasis and cancerogenesis in vitro; however, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based methods for drug screens are missing. We develop targeted organoid sequencing (TORNADO-seq), a high-throughput, high-content drug discovery platform that uses targeted RNA-seq to monitor the expression of large gene signatures for the detailed evaluation of cellular phenotypes in organoids. TORNADO-seq is a fast, highly reproducible time- and cost-effective ($5 per sample) method that can probe cell mixtures and their differentiation state in the intestinal system. We apply this method to isolate drugs that enrich for differentiated cell phenotypes and show that these drugs are highly efficacious against cancer compared to wild-type organoids. Furthermore, TORNADO-seq facilitates in-depth insight into the mode of action of these drugs. Our technology can easily be adapted to many other systems and will allow for more systematic, large-scale, and quantitative approaches to study the biology of complex cellular systems.

Abstract: Summary
Brain injury causes astrocytes to assume a reactive state that is essential for early tissue protection, but how reactive astrocytes affect later reparative processes is incompletely understood. In this study, we show that reactive astrocytes are crucial for vascular repair and remodeling after ischemic stroke in mice. Analysis of astrocytic gene expression data reveals substantial activation of transcriptional programs related to vascular remodeling after stroke. In vivo two-photon imaging provides evidence of astrocytes contacting newly formed vessels in cortex surrounding photothrombotic infarcts. Chemogenetic ablation of a subset of reactive astrocytes after stroke dramatically impairs vascular and extracellular matrix remodeling. This disruption of vascular repair is accompanied by prolonged blood flow deficits, exacerbated vascular permeability, ongoing cell death, and worsened motor recovery. In contrast, vascular structure in the non-ischemic brain is unaffected by focal astrocyte ablation. These findings position reactive astrocytes as critical cellular mediators of functionally important vascular remodeling during neural repair.

Abstract: Summary
The f subunit is localized at the base of the ATP synthase peripheral stalk. Its function in the human enzyme is poorly characterized. Because full disruption of its ATP5J2 gene with the CRISPR-Cas9 strategy in the HAP1 human model has been shown to cause alterations in the amounts of other ATP synthase subunits, here we investigated the role of the f subunit in HeLa cells by regulating its levels through RNA interference. We confirm the role of the f subunit in ATP synthase dimer stability and observe that its downregulation per se does not alter the amounts of the other enzyme subunits or ATP synthase synthetic/hydrolytic activity. We show that downregulation of the f subunit causes abnormal crista organization and decreases permeability transition pore (PTP) size, whereas its re-expression in f subunit knockdown cells rescues mitochondrial morphology and PTP-dependent swelling.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the understanding of the spatial architecture of tissue structure and function. Advancing the “transcript-centric” view of scRNA-seq analyses is presently restricted by the limited resolution of proteomics and genome-wide techniques to analyze post-translational modifications. Here, by combining spatial cell sorting with transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics/phosphoproteomics, we established the spatially resolved proteome landscape of the liver endothelium, yielding deep mechanistic insight into zonated vascular signaling mechanisms. Phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases was detected preferentially in the central vein area, resulting in an atypical enrichment of tyrosine phosphorylation. Prototypic biological validation identified Tie receptor signaling as a selective and specific regulator of vascular Wnt activity orchestrating angiocrine signaling, thereby controlling hepatocyte function during liver regeneration. Taken together, the study has yielded fundamental insight into the spatial organization of liver endothelial cell signaling. Spatial sorting may be employed as a universally adaptable strategy for multiomic analyses of scRNA-seq-defined cellular (sub)-populations.

Abstract: Summary
Organization of dynamic cellular structure is crucial for a variety of cellular functions. In this study, we report that Drosophila and Aedes have highly elastic cell membranes with extremely low membrane tension and high resistance to mechanical stress. In contrast to other eukaryotic cells, phospholipids are symmetrically distributed between the bilayer leaflets of the insect plasma membrane, where phospholipid scramblase (XKR) that disrupts the lipid asymmetry is constitutively active. We also demonstrate that XKR-facilitated phospholipid scrambling promotes the deformability of cell membranes by regulating both actin cortex dynamics and mechanical properties of the phospholipid bilayer. Moreover, XKR-mediated construction of elastic cell membranes is essential for hemocyte circulation in the Drosophila cardiovascular system. Deformation of mammalian cells is also enhanced by the expression of Aedes XKR, and thus phospholipid scrambling may contribute to formation of highly deformable cell membranes in a variety of living eukaryotic cells.

Abstract: Summary
Ploidy variation is a cancer hallmark and is frequently associated with poor prognosis in high-grade cancers. Using a Drosophila solid-tumor model where oncogenic Notch drives tumorigenesis in a transition-zone microenvironment in the salivary gland imaginal ring, we find that the tumor-initiating cells normally undergo endoreplication to become polyploid. Upregulation of Notch signaling, however, induces these polyploid transition-zone cells to re-enter mitosis and undergo tumorigenesis. Growth and progression of the transition-zone tumor are fueled by a combination of polyploid mitosis, endoreplication, and depolyploidization. Both polyploid mitosis and depolyploidization are error prone, resulting in chromosomal copy-number variation and polyaneuploidy. Comparative RNA-seq and epistasis analysis reveal that the DNA-damage response genes, also active during meiosis, are upregulated in these tumors and are required for the ploidy-reduction division. Together, these findings suggest that polyploidy and associated cell-cycle variants are critical for increased tumor-cell heterogeneity and genome instability during cancer progression.

Abstract: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have strong proliferative ability and multi-directional differentiation potential. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that is closely related to the loss of osteogenic differentiation function of BMSCs. Autophagy, plays a crucial role in the maintenance of cellular functions, but its regulatory mechanism during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the differential gene networks and pathways during BMSC osteogenesis using bioinformatics, and further validated the regulatory roles of autophagy during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in inflammatory condition in vitro. We found that Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) treatment led to actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and inhibited osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs. In addition, TNF-α enhanced Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) expression and decreased autophagy activation. ROCK1 knockdown reduced Endoplasmic Reticulum stress (ER stress) and promoted autophagy, resulting reversion of osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs under inflammatory condition. Rapamycin reversed the TNF-α-induced decrease in osteogenesis of BMSCs, assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and Alizarin staining. Autophagy treated with inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) further increased TNF-α-induced osteogenesis inhibition of BMSCs. Collectively, these results indicate that ER stress and dysfunction of autophagy promote inflammation-induced bone loss through the activation of ROCK1 signaling in BMSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Axonal generation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated amyloid-β (Aβ) plays a key role in AD neuropathology, but the cellular mechanisms involved in its release have remained elusive. We previously reported that palmitoylated APP (palAPP) partitions to lipid rafts where it serves as a preferred substrate for β-secretase. Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAMs) are cholesterol-rich lipid rafts that are upregulated in AD. Here, we show that downregulating MAM assembly by either RNA silencing or pharmacological modulation of the MAM-resident sigma1 receptor (S1R) leads to attenuated β-secretase cleavage of palAPP. Upregulation of MAMs promotes trafficking of palAPP to the cell surface, β-secretase cleavage, and Aβ generation. We develop a microfluidic device and use it to show that MAM levels alter Aβ generation specifically in neuronal processes and axons, but not in cell bodies. These data suggest therapeutic strategies for reducing axonal release of Aβ and attenuating β-amyloid pathology in AD.

Abstract: Summary
RAD51 facilitates replication fork reversal and protects reversed forks from nuclease degradation. Although potentially a useful replication stress response mechanism, unregulated fork reversal can cause genome instability. Here we show that RADX, a single-strand DNA binding protein that binds to and destabilizes RAD51 nucleofilaments, can either inhibit or promote fork reversal depending on replication stress levels. RADX inhibits fork reversal at elongating forks, thereby preventing fork slowing and collapse. Paradoxically, in the presence of persistent replication stress, RADX localizes to stalled forks to generate reversed fork structures. Consequently, inactivating RADX prevents fork-reversal-dependent telomere dysfunction in the absence of RTEL1 and blocks nascent strand degradation when fork protection factors are inactivated. Addition of RADX increases SMARCAL1-dependent fork reversal in conditions in which pre-binding RAD51 to a model fork substrate is inhibitory. Thus, RADX directly interacts with RAD51 and single-strand DNA to confine fork reversal to persistently stalled forks.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal loss in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with impaired proteostasis and accumulation of α-syn microaggregates in dopaminergic neurons. These microaggregates promote seeding of α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology between synaptically linked neurons. However, the mechanism by which seeding is initiated is not clear. Using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) models of PD that allow comparison of SNCA mutant cells with isogenic controls, we find that SNCA mutant neurons accumulate α-syn deposits that cluster to multiple endomembrane compartments, specifically multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and lysosomes. We demonstrate that A53T and E46K α-syn variants bind and sequester LC3B monomers into detergent-insoluble microaggregates on the surface of late endosomes, increasing α-syn excretion via exosomes and promoting seeding of α-syn from SNCA mutant neurons to wild-type (WT) isogenic controls. Finally, we show that constitutive inactivation of LC3B promotes α-syn accumulation and seeding, while LC3B activation inhibits these events, offering mechanistic insight into the spread of synucleinopathy in PD.

Abstract: Summary
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects 257 million people worldwide. HBV infection requires establishment and persistence of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, a viral episome, in nucleus. Here, we study cccDNA spatial localization in the 3D host genome by using chromosome conformation capture-based sequencing analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We show that transcriptionally inactive cccDNA is not randomly distributed in host nucleus. Rather, it is preferentially accumulated at specialized areas, including regions close to chromosome 19 (chr.19). Activation of the cccDNA is apparently associated with its re-localization, from a pre-established heterochromatin hub formed by 5 regions of chr.19 to transcriptionally active regions formed by chr.19 and nearby chromosomes including chr.16, 17, 20, and 22. This active versus inactive positioning at discrete regions of the host genome is primarily controlled by the viral HBx protein and by host factors including the structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 5/6 (SMC5/6) complex.

Abstract: Summary
Adoptive cell therapy with virus-specific T cells has been used successfully to treat life-threatening viral infections, supporting application of this approach to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We expand severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) T cells from the peripheral blood of COVID-19-recovered donors and non-exposed controls using different culture conditions. We observe that the choice of cytokines modulates the expansion, phenotype, and hierarchy of antigenic recognition by SARS-CoV-2 T cells. Culture with interleukin (IL)-2/4/7, but not under other cytokine-driven conditions, results in more than 1,000-fold expansion in SARS-CoV-2 T cells with a retained phenotype, function, and hierarchy of antigenic recognition compared with baseline (pre-expansion) samples. Expanded cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are directed against structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the receptor-binding domain of Spike. SARS-CoV-2 T cells cannot be expanded efficiently from the peripheral blood of non-exposed controls. Because corticosteroids are used for management of severe COVID-19, we propose an efficient strategy to inactivate the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) in SARS-CoV-2 CTLs using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.

Abstract: Summary
Rank signaling enhances stemness in mouse and human mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and mediates mammary tumor initiation. Mammary tumors initiated by oncogenes or carcinogen exposure display high levels of Rank and Rank pathway inhibitors have emerged as a new strategy for breast cancer prevention and treatment. Here, we show that ectopic Rank expression in the mammary epithelia unexpectedly delays tumor onset and reduces tumor incidence in the oncogene-driven Neu and PyMT models. Mechanistically, we have found that ectopic expression of Rank or exposure to Rankl induces senescence, even in the absence of other oncogenic mutations. Rank leads to DNA damage and senescence through p16/p19. Moreover, RANK-induced senescence is essential for Rank-driven stemness, and although initially translates into delayed tumor growth, eventually promotes tumor progression and metastasis. We uncover a dual role for Rank in the mammary epithelia: Rank induces senescence and stemness, delaying tumor initiation but increasing tumor aggressiveness.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor vessel co-option is poorly understood, yet it is a resistance mechanism against anti-angiogenic therapy (AAT). The heterogeneity of co-opted endothelial cells (ECs) and pericytes, co-opting cancer and myeloid cells in tumors growing via vessel co-option, has not been investigated at the single-cell level. Here, we use a murine AAT-resistant lung tumor model, in which VEGF-targeting induces vessel co-option for continued growth. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 31,964 cells reveals, unexpectedly, a largely similar transcriptome of co-opted tumor ECs (TECs) and pericytes as their healthy counterparts. Notably, we identify cell types that might contribute to vessel co-option, i.e., an invasive cancer-cell subtype, possibly assisted by a matrix-remodeling macrophage population, and another M1-like macrophage subtype, possibly involved in keeping or rendering vascular cells quiescent.

Abstract: Summary
Synchronization has been implicated in neuronal communication, but causal evidence remains indirect. We use optogenetics to generate depolarizing currents in pyramidal neurons of the cat visual cortex, emulating excitatory synaptic inputs under precise temporal control, while measuring spike output. The cortex transforms constant excitation into strong gamma-band synchronization, revealing the well-known cortical resonance. Increasing excitation with ramps increases the strength and frequency of synchronization. Slow, symmetric excitation profiles reveal hysteresis of power and frequency. White-noise input sequences enable causal analysis of network transmission, establishing that the cortical gamma-band resonance preferentially transmits coherent input components. Models composed of recurrently coupled excitatory and inhibitory units uncover a crucial role of feedback inhibition and suggest that hysteresis can arise through spike-frequency adaptation. The presented approach provides a powerful means to investigate the resonance properties of local circuits and probe how these properties transform input and shape transmission.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal activity-induced enhancers drive gene activation. We demonstrate that BRG1, the core subunit of SWI/SNF-like BAF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, regulates neuronal activity-induced enhancers. Upon stimulation, BRG1 is recruited to enhancers in an H3K27Ac-dependent manner. BRG1 regulates enhancer basal activities and inducibility by affecting cohesin binding, enhancer-promoter looping, RNA polymerase II recruitment, and enhancer RNA expression. We identify a serine phosphorylation site in BRG1 that is induced by neuronal stimulations and is sensitive to CaMKII inhibition. BRG1 phosphorylation affects its interaction with several transcription co-factors, including the NuRD repressor complex and cohesin, possibly modulating BRG1-mediated transcription outcomes. Using mice with knockin mutations, we show that non-phosphorylatable BRG1 fails to efficiently induce activity-dependent genes, whereas phosphomimic BRG1 increases enhancer activity and inducibility. These mutant mice display anxiety-like phenotypes and altered responses to stress. Therefore, we reveal a mechanism connecting neuronal signaling to enhancer activities through BRG1 phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
The hypothesis that reversed, excitatory GABA may be involved in various brain pathologies, including epileptogenesis, is appealing but controversial because of the technical difficulty of probing endogenous GABAergic synaptic function in vivo. We overcome this challenge by non-invasive extracellular recording of neuronal firing responses to optogenetically evoked and spontaneously occurring inhibitory perisomatic GABAergic field potentials, generated by individual parvalbumin interneurons on their target pyramidal cells. Our direct probing of GABAergic transmission suggests a rather anecdotal participation of excitatory GABA in two specific models of epileptogenesis in the mouse CA3 circuit in vivo, even though this does not preclude its expression in other brain areas or pathological conditions. Our approach allows the detection of distinct alterations of inhibition during spontaneous activity in vivo, with high sensitivity. It represents a promising tool for the investigation of excitatory GABA in different pathological conditions that may affect the hippocampal circuit.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, sound is detected by mechanosensory hair cells that are activated in response to vibrations at frequency-dependent positions along the cochlear duct. We demonstrate that inner ear supporting cells provide a structural framework for transmitting sound energy through the cochlear partition. Humans and mice with mutations in GAS2, encoding a cytoskeletal regulatory protein, exhibit hearing loss due to disorganization and destabilization of microtubule bundles in pillar and Deiters’ cells, two types of inner ear supporting cells with unique cytoskeletal specializations. Failure to maintain microtubule bundle integrity reduced supporting cell stiffness, which in turn altered cochlear micromechanics in Gas2 mutants. Vibratory responses to sound were measured in cochleae from live mice, revealing defects in the propagation and amplification of the traveling wave in Gas2 mutants. We propose that the microtubule bundling activity of GAS2 imparts supporting cells with mechanical properties for transmitting sound energy through the cochlea.

Abstract: Although the mechanism of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) initiation through BCR/ABL oncogene has been well characterized, CML cell differentiation into erythroid lineage cells remains poorly understood. Using CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identify Chromobox 8 (CBX8) as a negative regulator of K562 cell differentiation into erythrocytes. CBX8 is degraded via proteasomal pathway during K562 cell differentiation, which activates the expression of erythroid differentiation-related genes that are repressed by CBX8 in the complex of PRC1. During the differentiation process, the serine/threonine-protein kinase PIM1 phosphorylates serine 196 on CBX8, which contributes to CBX8 reduction. When CD235A expression levels are analyzed, the result reveals that the knockdown of PIM1 inhibits K562 cell differentiation. We also identify TRIM28 as another interaction partner of CBX8 by proteomic analysis. Intriguingly, TRIM28 maintains protein stability of CBX8 and TRIM28 loss significantly induces proteasomal degradation of CBX8, resulting in an acceleration of erythroid differentiation. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of the CBX8-TRIM28 axis during CML cell differentiation, suggesting that CBX8 and TRIM28 are promising novel targets for CML research.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can dampen the antitumor activity of T cells, yet the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that C1q+ TAMs are regulated by an RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) program and modulate tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells by expressing multiple immunomodulatory ligands. Macrophage-specific knockout of an m6A methyltransferase Mettl14 drives CD8+ T cell differentiation along a dysfunctional trajectory, impairing CD8+ T cells to eliminate tumors. Mettl14-deficient C1q+ TAMs show a decreased m6A abundance on and a higher level of transcripts of Ebi3, a cytokine subunit. In addition, neutralization of EBI3 leads to reinvigoration of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells and overcomes immunosuppressive impact in mice. We show that the METTL14-m6A levels are negatively correlated with dysfunctional T cell levels in patients with colorectal cancer, supporting the clinical relevance of this regulatory pathway. Thus, our study demonstrates how an m6A methyltransferase in TAMs promotes CD8+ T cell dysfunction and tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Central nervous system injury re-initiates neurogenesis in anamniotes (amphibians and fishes), but not in mammals. Activation of the innate immune system promotes regenerative neurogenesis, but it is fundamentally unknown whether this is indirect through the activation of known developmental signaling pathways or whether immune cells directly signal to progenitor cells using mechanisms that are unique to regeneration. Using single-cell RNA-seq of progenitor cells and macrophages, as well as cell-type-specific manipulations, we provide evidence for a direct signaling axis from specific lesion-activated macrophages to spinal progenitor cells to promote regenerative neurogenesis in zebrafish. Mechanistically, TNFa from pro-regenerative macrophages induces Tnfrsf1a-mediated AP-1 activity in progenitors to increase regeneration-promoting expression of hdac1 and neurogenesis. This establishes the principle that macrophages directly communicate to spinal progenitor cells via non-developmental signals after injury, providing potential targets for future interventions in the regeneration-deficient spinal cord of mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming powers and polarizes macrophage functions, but the nature and regulation of this response during infection with pathogens remain controversial. In this study, we characterize the metabolic and transcriptional responses of murine macrophages to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in order to disentangle the underlying mechanisms. We find that type I interferon (IFN) signaling correlates with the decreased glycolysis and mitochondrial damage that is induced by live, but not killed, Mtb. Macrophages lacking the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) maintain glycolytic flux and mitochondrial function during Mtb infection in vitro and in vivo. IFNβ itself restrains the glycolytic shift of inflammatory macrophages and initiates mitochondrial stress. We confirm that type I IFN acts upstream of mitochondrial damage using macrophages lacking the protein STING. We suggest that a type I IFN-mitochondrial feedback loop controls macrophage responses to mycobacteria and that this could contribute to pathogenesis across a range of diseases.

Abstract: The neural tube is the precursor of the central nervous system. Its early formation and growth are known to be extremely biased along the anteroposterior (AP) axis. Several mechanisms including addition of cells from the tail bud, lateral pressure from surrounding tissues and oriented cell divisions have been proposed to contribute to this biased growth. Here we show that, contrary to what has been found in posterior regions encompassing the tail bud region, the growth of the anterior trunk neural tube is slower along the AP direction than in the other axes. We found that this is due to anchorage of the neural tube to the matrix which favors apicobasal elongation at the expense of AP growth. In addition, as the neural tube develops, we found a moderate slowdown of cell proliferation that could account for the overall reduction of the pace of 3D growth in the same time window. However, as we found no preferred orientation of cell division, changes in cell cycle pace are unlikely to directly contribute to the observed AP-hindered growth of neural tube. Overall, these data indicate that neural tube growth is not intrinsically positively biased along the AP axis. Rather it switches from AP-favored to AP-hindered regimes between the most posterior and anterior trunk neural tube regions.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal mammals exhibit heightened motivation to care for offspring, but the underlying neuromolecular mechanisms have yet to be clarified. Here, we report that the calcitonin receptor (Calcr) and its ligand amylin are expressed in distinct neuronal populations in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) and are upregulated in mothers. Calcr+ MPOA neurons activated by parental care project to somatomotor and monoaminergic brainstem nuclei. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing reveals that significant modification of afferents to Calcr+ neurons occurs in mothers. Knockdown of either Calcr or amylin gene expression hampers risk-taking maternal care, and specific silencing of Calcr+ MPOA neurons inhibits nurturing behaviors, while pharmacogenetic activation prevents infanticide in virgin males. These data indicate that Calcr+ MPOA neurons are required for both maternal and allomaternal nurturing behaviors and that upregulation of amylin-Calcr signaling in the MPOA at least partially mediates risk-taking maternal care, possibly via modified connectomics of Calcr+ neurons postpartum.

Abstract: Summary
During influenza A epidemics, bacterial coinfection is a major cause of increased morbidity and mortality. However, the roles of host factors in regulating influenza A virus (IAV)-triggered bacterial coinfection remain elusive. Cyclophilin A (CypA) is an important regulator of infection and immunity. Here, we show that IAV-induced CypA expression facilitates group A Streptococcus (GAS) coinfection both in vitro and in vivo. Upon IAV infection, CypA interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and inhibited E3 ligase cCbl-mediated, K48-linked ubiquitination of FAK, which positively regulates integrin α5 expression and actin rearrangement via the FAK/Akt signaling pathway to facilitate GAS colonization and invasion. Notably, CypA deficiency or inhibition by cyclosporine A significantly inhibits IAV-triggered GAS coinfection in mice. Collectively, these findings reveal that CypA is critical for GAS infection, and induction of CypA expression is another way for IAV to promote bacterial coinfection, suggesting that CypA is a promising therapeutic target for the secondary bacterial infection.

Abstract: Summary
Sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) represent synchronous discharges of hippocampal neurons and are believed to play a major role in memory consolidation. A large body of evidence suggests that SWRs are exclusively generated in the CA3-CA2 network. In contrast, here, we provide several lines of evidence showing that the subiculum can function as a secondary SWRs generator. SWRs with subicular origin propagate forward into the entorhinal cortex as well as backward into the hippocampus proper. Our findings suggest that the output structures of the hippocampus are not only passively facilitating the transfer of SWRs to the cortex, but they also can actively contribute to the genesis of SWRs. We hypothesize that SWRs with a subicular origin may be important for the consolidation of information conveyed to the hippocampus via the temporoammonic pathway.

Abstract: Summary
During the repeated cycles of damage and repair in many muscle disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the muscle stem cell (MuSC) pool becomes less efficient at responding to and repairing damage. The underlying mechanism of such stem cell dysfunction is not fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the distinct early telomere shortening of diseased MuSCs in both mice and young DMD patients is associated with aberrant NF-κB activation. We find that prolonged NF-κB activation in MuSCs in chronic injuries leads to shortened telomeres and Ku80 dysregulation and results in severe skeletal muscle defects. Our studies provide evidence of a role for NF-κB in regulating stem-cell-specific telomere length, independently of cell replication, and could be a congruent mechanism that is applicable to additional tissues and/or diseases characterized by systemic chronic inflammation.
