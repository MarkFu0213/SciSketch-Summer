Abstract: Summary
During autophagy, vesicle dynamics and cargo recruitment are driven by numerous adaptors and receptors that become tethered to the phagophore through interactions with lipidated ATG8/LC3 decorating the expanding membrane. Most currently described ATG8-binding proteins exploit a well-defined ATG8-interacting motif (AIM, or LC3-interacting region [LIR]) that contacts a hydrophobic patch on ATG8 known as the LIR/AIM docking site (LDS). Here we describe a new class of ATG8 interactors that exploit ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)-like sequences for high-affinity binding to an alternative ATG8 interaction site. Assays with candidate UIM-containing proteins together with unbiased screens identified a large collection of UIM-based ATG8 interactors in plants, yeast, and humans. Analysis of a subset also harboring ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domains revealed a role for UIM-directed autophagy in clearing non-functional CDC48/p97 complexes, including some impaired in human disease. With this new class of adaptors and receptors, we greatly extend the reach of selective autophagy and identify new factors regulating autophagic vesicle dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Several general principles of global 3D genome organization have recently been established, including non-random positioning of chromosomes and genes in the cell nucleus, distinct chromatin compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs). However, the extent and nature of cell-to-cell and cell-intrinsic variability in genome architecture are still poorly characterized. Here, we systematically probe heterogeneity in genome organization. High-throughput optical mapping of several hundred intra-chromosomal interactions in individual human fibroblasts demonstrates low association frequencies, which are determined by genomic distance, higher-order chromatin architecture, and chromatin environment. The structure of TADs is variable between individual cells, and inter-TAD associations are common. Furthermore, single-cell analysis reveals independent behavior of individual alleles in single nuclei. Our observations reveal extensive variability and heterogeneity in genome organization at the level of individual alleles and demonstrate the coexistence of a broad spectrum of genome configurations in a cell population.

Abstract: Summary
Over the last decade, various new therapies have been developed to promote anti-tumor immunity. Despite interesting clinical results in hematological malignancies, the development of bispecific killer-cell-engager antibody formats directed against tumor cells and stimulating anti-tumor T cell immunity has proved challenging, mostly due to toxicity problems. We report here the generation of trifunctional natural killer (NK) cell engagers (NKCEs), targeting two activating receptors, NKp46 and CD16, on NK cells and a tumor antigen on cancer cells. Trifunctional NKCEs were more potent in vitro than clinical therapeutic antibodies targeting the same tumor antigen. They had similar in vivo pharmacokinetics to full IgG antibodies and no off-target effects and efficiently controlled tumor growth in mouse models of solid and invasive tumors. Trifunctional NKCEs thus constitute a new generation of molecules for fighting cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Varying pH of luminal fluid along the female reproductive tract is a physiological cue that modulates sperm motility. CatSper is a sperm-specific, pH-sensitive calcium channel essential for hyperactivated motility and male fertility. Multi-subunit CatSper channel complexes organize linear Ca2+ signaling nanodomains along the sperm tail. Here, we identify EF-hand calcium-binding domain-containing protein 9 (EFCAB9) as a bifunctional, cytoplasmic machine modulating the channel activity and the domain organization of CatSper. Knockout mice studies demonstrate that EFCAB9, in complex with the CatSper subunit, CATSPERζ, is essential for pH-dependent and Ca2+-sensitive activation of the CatSper channel. In the absence of EFCAB9, sperm motility and fertility is compromised, and the linear arrangement of the Ca2+ signaling domains is disrupted. EFCAB9 interacts directly with CATSPERζ in a Ca2+-dependent manner and dissociates at elevated pH. These observations suggest that EFCAB9 is a long-sought, intracellular, pH-dependent Ca2+ sensor that triggers changes in sperm motility.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from embryonic endothelial precursors and pre-HSCs is precisely regulated by signaling pathways and transcription factors. Nevertheless, regulatory roles of non-coding RNAs remain unknown. Taking advantage of our ability to capture rare pre-HSCs and HSCs in vivo, we generated a single-cell landscape of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during HSC development. Combining bioinformatics and functional screening, we identified 6 lncRNAs influencing hematopoiesis in vitro. We further revealed that H19 lncRNA is pivotal for in vivo HSC emergence in aorta-gonads-mesonephros region. Early H19 lncRNA deficiency blocked endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, which was independent of the H19-derived miR, miR-675. Moreover, H19-deficient pre-HSCs displayed promoter hypermethylation and concomitant downregulation of several master hematopoietic transcription factors, including Runx1 and Spi1. H19 deficiency increased the activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, a regulator of DNA methylation, which partially contributed to the observed hematopoietic defect. Our findings provide a resource for further analysis of lncRNAs in embryonic HSC development.

Abstract: Summary
Mammals evolved in the face of fluctuating food availability. How the immune system adapts to transient nutritional stress remains poorly understood. Here, we show that memory T cells collapsed in secondary lymphoid organs in the context of dietary restriction (DR) but dramatically accumulated within the bone marrow (BM), where they adopted a state associated with energy conservation. This response was coordinated by glucocorticoids and associated with a profound remodeling of the BM compartment, which included an increase in T cell homing factors, erythropoiesis, and adipogenesis. Adipocytes, as well as CXCR4-CXCL12 and S1P-S1P1R interactions, contributed to enhanced T cell accumulation in BM during DR. Memory T cell homing to BM during DR was associated with enhanced protection against infections and tumors. Together, this work uncovers a fundamental host strategy to sustain and optimize immunological memory during nutritional challenges that involved a temporal and spatial reorganization of the memory pool within “safe haven” compartments.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon-gamma (IFNG) augments immune function yet promotes T cell exhaustion through PDL1. How these opposing effects are integrated to impact immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is unclear. We show that while inhibiting tumor IFNG signaling decreases interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in cancer cells, it increases ISGs in immune cells by enhancing IFNG produced by exhausted T cells (TEX). In tumors with favorable antigenicity, these TEX mediate rejection. In tumors with neoantigen or MHC-I loss, TEX instead utilize IFNG to drive maturation of innate immune cells, including a PD1+TRAIL+ ILC1 population. By disabling an inhibitory circuit impacting PD1 and TRAIL, blocking tumor IFNG signaling promotes innate immune killing. Thus, interferon signaling in cancer cells and immune cells oppose each other to establish a regulatory relationship that limits both adaptive and innate immune killing. In melanoma and lung cancer patients, perturbation of this relationship is associated with ICB response independent of tumor mutational burden.

Abstract: Summary
Down syndrome (DS) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, and cognitive defects in DS patients may arise from imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Understanding the mechanisms underlying such imbalances may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Here, we show that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from DS patients overproduce OLIG2+ ventral forebrain neural progenitors. As a result, DS hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids excessively produce specific subclasses of GABAergic interneurons and cause impaired recognition memory in neuronal chimeric mice. Increased OLIG2 expression in DS cells directly upregulates interneuron lineage-determining transcription factors. shRNA-mediated knockdown of OLIG2 largely reverses abnormal gene expression in early-stage DS neural progenitors, reduces interneuron production in DS organoids and chimeric mouse brains, and improves behavioral deficits in DS chimeric mice. Thus, altered OLIG2 expression may underlie neurodevelopmental abnormalities and cognitive defects in DS patients.

Abstract: Summary
FOXO3 is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that has been linked to longevity. Here we wanted to find out whether human vascular cells could be functionally enhanced by engineering them to express an activated form of FOXO3. This was accomplished via genome editing at two nucleotides in human embryonic stem cells, followed by differentiation into a range of vascular cell types. FOXO3-activated vascular cells exhibited delayed aging and increased resistance to oxidative injury compared with wild-type cells. When tested in a therapeutic context, FOXO3-enhanced vascular cells promoted vascular regeneration in a mouse model of ischemic injury and were resistant to tumorigenic transformation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, constitutively active FOXO3 conferred cytoprotection by transcriptionally downregulating CSRP1. Taken together, our findings provide mechanistic insights into FOXO3-mediated vascular protection and indicate that FOXO3 activation may provide a means for generating more effective and safe biomaterials for cell replacement therapies.

Antisense lncRNA Transcription Mediates DNA Demethylation to Drive Stochastic Protocadherin α Promoter Choice,

Abstract: Summary
Stochastic activation of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) α, β, and γ genes generates a cell-surface identity code in individual neurons that functions in neural circuit assembly. Here, we show that Pcdhα gene choice involves the activation of an antisense promoter located in the first exon of each Pcdhα alternate gene. Transcription of an antisense long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) from this antisense promoter extends through the sense promoter, leading to DNA demethylation of the CTCF binding sites proximal to each promoter. Demethylation-dependent CTCF binding to both promoters facilitates cohesin-mediated DNA looping with a distal enhancer (HS5-1), locking in the transcriptional state of the chosen Pcdhα gene. Uncoupling DNA demethylation from antisense transcription by Tet3 overexpression in mouse olfactory neurons promotes CTCF binding to all Pcdhα promoters, resulting in proximity-biased DNA looping of the HS5-1 enhancer. Thus, antisense transcription-mediated promoter demethylation functions as a mechanism for distance-independent enhancer/promoter DNA looping to ensure stochastic Pcdhα promoter choice.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple signatures of somatic mutations have been identified in cancer genomes. Exome sequences of 1,001 human cancer cell lines and 577 xenografts revealed most common mutational signatures, indicating past activity of the underlying processes, usually in appropriate cancer types. To investigate ongoing patterns of mutational-signature generation, cell lines were cultured for extended periods and subsequently DNA sequenced. Signatures of discontinued exposures, including tobacco smoke and ultraviolet light, were not generated in vitro. Signatures of normal and defective DNA repair and replication continued to be generated at roughly stable mutation rates. Signatures of APOBEC cytidine deaminase DNA-editing exhibited substantial fluctuations in mutation rate over time with episodic bursts of mutations. The initiating factors for the bursts are unclear, although retrotransposon mobilization may contribute. The examined cell lines constitute a resource of live experimental models of mutational processes, which potentially retain patterns of activity and regulation operative in primary human cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Stromal cell populations that maintain hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are generally characterized in steady-state conditions. Here, we report a comprehensive atlas of bone marrow stromal cell subpopulations under homeostatic and stress conditions using mass cytometry (CyTOF)-based single-cell protein analysis. We identified 28 subsets of non-hematopoietic cells during homeostasis, 14 of which expressed hematopoietic regulatory factors. Irradiation-based conditioning for HSPC transplantation led to the loss of most of these populations, including the LeptinR+ and Nestin+ subsets. In contrast, a subset expressing Ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73) was retained and a specific CD73+NGFRhigh population expresses high levels of cytokines during homeostasis and stress. Genetic ablation of CD73 compromised HSPC transplantation in an acute setting without long-term changes in bone marrow HSPCs. Thus, this protein-based expression mapping reveals distinct sets of stromal cells in the bone marrow and how they change in clinically relevant stress settings to contribute to early stages of hematopoietic regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Heart disease is a paramount cause of global death and disability. Although cardiomyocyte death plays a causal role and its suppression would be logical, no clinical counter-measures target the responsible intracellular pathways. Therapeutic progress has been hampered by lack of preclinical human validation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase-4 (MAP4K4) is activated in failing human hearts and relevant rodent models. Using human induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and MAP4K4 gene silencing, we demonstrate that death induced by oxidative stress requires MAP4K4. Consequently, we devised a small-molecule inhibitor, DMX-5804, that rescues cell survival, mitochondrial function, and calcium cycling in hiPSC-CMs. As proof of principle that drug discovery in hiPSC-CMs may predict efficacy in vivo, DMX-5804 reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice by more than 50%. We implicate MAP4K4 as a well-posed target toward suppressing human cardiac cell death and highlight the utility of hiPSC-CMs in drug discovery to enhance cardiomyocyte survival.

Abstract: Summary
Following injury, differentiated epithelial cells can serve as a stem cell-independent source for tissue regeneration by undergoing reprogramming into other cell types. The intrinsic molecular basis underlying plasticity of differentiated cells remains largely unaddressed. Here we show that Arid1a, a key component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, controls liver regeneration and gene expression associated with emergence of injury-induced liver-progenitor-like cells (LPLCs). Hepatocyte-specific Arid1a ablation reduces LPLC gene expression in several models of periportal liver injury and impairs liver regeneration, leading to organ dysfunction. Arid1a establishes a permissive chromatin state at LPLC-enriched genes during homeostasis, suggesting it endows hepatocytes with competence to respond to injury-induced signals. Consistently, Arid1a facilitates binding of YAP, a critical regeneration signaling pathway, to LPLC-enriched genes, and Arid1a deletion prevents their YAP-associated induction following injury. Together, these findings provide a framework for studying the contributions of injury-induced LPLCs to periportal liver regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell heterogeneity is recognized as functionally relevant for tissue homeostasis and repair. The identity, context dependence, and regulation of skeletal muscle satellite cell (SC) subsets remains poorly understood. We identify a minor subset of Pax7+ SCs that is indelibly marked by an inducible Mx1-Cre transgene in vivo, is enriched for Pax3 expression, and has reduced ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels. Mx1+ SCs possess potent stem cell activity upon transplantation but minimally contribute to endogenous muscle repair, due to their relative low abundance. In contrast, a dramatic clonal expansion of Mx1+ SCs allows extensive contribution to muscle repair and niche repopulation upon selective pressure of radiation stress, consistent with reserve stem cell (RSC) properties. Loss of Pax3 in RSCs increased ROS content and diminished survival and stress tolerance. These observations demonstrate that the Pax7+ SC pool contains a discrete population of radiotolerant RSCs that undergo clonal expansion under severe stress.

Abstract: Summary
Variable, glutamine-encoding, CAA interruptions indicate that a property of the uninterrupted HTT CAG repeat sequence, distinct from the length of huntingtin’s polyglutamine segment, dictates the rate at which Huntington’s disease (HD) develops. The timing of onset shows no significant association with HTT cis-eQTLs but is influenced, sometimes in a sex-specific manner, by polymorphic variation at multiple DNA maintenance genes, suggesting that the special onset-determining property of the uninterrupted CAG repeat is a propensity for length instability that leads to its somatic expansion. Additional naturally occurring genetic modifier loci, defined by GWAS, may influence HD pathogenesis through other mechanisms. These findings have profound implications for the pathogenesis of HD and other repeat diseases and question the fundamental premise that polyglutamine length determines the rate of pathogenesis in the “polyglutamine disorders.”

TEs frequently harbor binding sites for transcriptional regulators, thus enabling coordinated genome-wide activation of species- and context-specific gene expression programs, but such regulation must be balanced against their genotoxic potential. Here, we show that Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)-containing zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) control the timely and pleiotropic activation of TE-derived transcriptional cis regulators during early embryogenesis. Evolutionarily recent SVA, HERVK, and HERVH TE subgroups contribute significantly to chromatin opening during human embryonic genome activation and are KLF-stimulated enhancers in naive human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). KZFPs of corresponding evolutionary ages are simultaneously induced and repress the transcriptional activity of these TEs. Finally, the same KZFP-controlled TE-based enhancers later serve as developmental and tissue-specific enhancers. Thus, by controlling the transcriptional impact of TEs during embryogenesis, KZFPs facilitate their genome-wide incorporation into transcriptional networks, thereby contributing to human genome regulation.

Abstract: Summary
TRPA1 is a chemosensory ion channel that functions as a sentinel for structurally diverse electrophilic irritants. Channel activation occurs through an unusual mechanism involving covalent modification of cysteine residues clustered within an amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Here, we describe a peptidergic scorpion toxin (WaTx) that activates TRPA1 by penetrating the plasma membrane to access the same intracellular site modified by reactive electrophiles. WaTx stabilizes TRPA1 in a biophysically distinct active state characterized by prolonged channel openings and low Ca2+ permeability. Consequently, WaTx elicits acute pain and pain hypersensitivity but fails to trigger efferent release of neuropeptides and neurogenic inflammation typically produced by noxious electrophiles. These findings provide a striking example of convergent evolution whereby chemically disparate animal- and plant-derived irritants target the same key allosteric regulatory site to differentially modulate channel activity. WaTx is a unique pharmacological probe for dissecting TRPA1 function and its contribution to acute and persistent pain.

Abstract: Summary
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) produced from back-splicing of exons of pre-mRNAs are widely expressed, but current understanding of their functions is limited. These RNAs are stable in general and are thought to have unique structural conformations distinct from their linear RNA cognates. Here, we show that endogenous circRNAs tend to form 16–26 bp imperfect RNA duplexes and act as inhibitors of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) related to innate immunity. Upon poly(I:C) stimulation or viral infection, circRNAs are globally degraded by RNase L, a process required for PKR activation in early cellular innate immune responses. Augmented PKR phosphorylation and circRNA reduction are found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from patients with autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Importantly, overexpression of the dsRNA-containing circRNA in PBMCs or T cells derived from SLE can alleviate the aberrant PKR activation cascade, thus providing a connection between circRNAs and SLE.

Abstract: Summary
Group II introns are a class of retroelements that invade DNA through a copy-and-paste mechanism known as retrotransposition. Their coordinated activities occur within a complex that includes a maturase protein, which promotes splicing through an unknown mechanism. The mechanism of splice site exchange within the RNA active site during catalysis also remains unclear. We determined two cryo-EM structures at 3.6-Å resolution of a group II intron reverse splicing into DNA. These structures reveal that the branch-site domain VI helix swings 90°, enabling substrate exchange during DNA integration. The maturase assists catalysis through a transient RNA-protein contact with domain VI that positions the branch-site adenosine for lariat formation during forward splicing. These findings provide the first direct evidence of the role the maturase plays during group II intron catalysis. The domain VI dynamics closely parallel spliceosomal branch-site helix movement and provide strong evidence for a retroelement origin of the spliceosome.

Abstract: Summary
Mammals rely on a network of circadian clocks to control daily systemic metabolism and physiology. The central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is considered hierarchically dominant over peripheral clocks, whose degree of independence, or tissue-level autonomy, has never been ascertained in vivo. Using arrhythmic Bmal1-null mice, we generated animals with reconstituted circadian expression of BMAL1 exclusively in the liver (Liver-RE). High-throughput transcriptomics and metabolomics show that the liver has independent circadian functions specific for metabolic processes such as the NAD+ salvage pathway and glycogen turnover. However, although BMAL1 occupies chromatin at most genomic targets in Liver-RE mice, circadian expression is restricted to ∼10% of normally rhythmic transcripts. Finally, rhythmic clock gene expression is lost in Liver-RE mice under constant darkness. Hence, full circadian function in the liver depends on signals emanating from other clocks, and light contributes to tissue-autonomous clock function.

Abstract: Summary
When a behavior repeatedly fails to achieve its goal, animals often give up and become passive, which can be strategic for preserving energy or regrouping between attempts. It is unknown how the brain identifies behavioral failures and mediates this behavioral-state switch. In larval zebrafish swimming in virtual reality, visual feedback can be withheld so that swim attempts fail to trigger expected visual flow. After tens of seconds of such motor futility, animals became passive for similar durations. Whole-brain calcium imaging revealed noradrenergic neurons that responded specifically to failed swim attempts and radial astrocytes whose calcium levels accumulated with increasing numbers of failed attempts. Using cell ablation and optogenetic or chemogenetic activation, we found that noradrenergic neurons progressively activated brainstem radial astrocytes, which then suppressed swimming. Thus, radial astrocytes perform a computation critical for behavior: they accumulate evidence that current actions are ineffective and consequently drive changes in behavioral states.

Abstract: Summary
Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are a major class of lipid-anchored plasma membrane proteins. GPI-APs form nanoclusters generated by cortical acto-myosin activity. While our understanding of the physical principles governing this process is emerging, the molecular machinery and functional relevance of GPI-AP nanoclustering are unknown. Here, we first show that a membrane receptor signaling pathway directs nanocluster formation. Arg-Gly-Asp motif-containing ligands bound to the β1-integrin receptor activate src and focal adhesion kinases, resulting in RhoA signaling. This cascade triggers actin-nucleation via specific formins, which, along with myosin activity, drive the nanoclustering of membrane proteins with actin-binding domains. Concurrently, talin-mediated activation of the mechano-transducer vinculin is required for the coupling of the acto-myosin machinery to inner-leaflet lipids, thereby generating GPI-AP nanoclusters. Second, we show that these nanoclusters are functional; disruption of their formation either in GPI-anchor remodeling mutants or in vinculin mutants impairs cell spreading and migration, hallmarks of integrin function.

Abstract: Summary
Metformin is the first-line therapy for treating type 2 diabetes and a promising anti-aging drug. We set out to address the fundamental question of how gut microbes and nutrition, key regulators of host physiology, affect the effects of metformin. Combining two tractable genetic models, the bacterium E. coli and the nematode C. elegans, we developed a high-throughput four-way screen to define the underlying host-microbe-drug-nutrient interactions. We show that microbes integrate cues from metformin and the diet through the phosphotransferase signaling pathway that converges on the transcriptional regulator Crp. A detailed experimental characterization of metformin effects downstream of Crp in combination with metabolic modeling of the microbiota in metformin-treated type 2 diabetic patients predicts the production of microbial agmatine, a regulator of metformin effects on host lipid metabolism and lifespan. Our high-throughput screening platform paves the way for identifying exploitable drug-nutrient-microbiome interactions to improve host health and longevity through targeted microbiome therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The ornately geometric walls of pollen grains have inspired scientists for decades. We show that the evolved diversity of these patterns is entirely recapitulated by a biophysical model in which an initially uniform polysaccharide layer in the extracellular space, mechanically coupled to the cell membrane, phase separates to a spatially modulated state. Experiments reveal this process occurring in living cells. We observe that in ∼10% of extant species, this phase separation reaches equilibrium during development such that individual pollen grains are identical and perfectly reproducible. About 90% of species undergo an arrest of this process prior to equilibrium such that individual grains are similar but inexact copies. Equilibrium patterns have appeared multiple times during the evolution of seed plants, but selection does not favor these states. This framework for pattern development provides a route to rationalizing the surface textures of other secreted structures, such as cell walls and insect cuticle.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional immunization strategies will likely be insufficient for the development of a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) vaccine for HIV or other difficult pathogens because of the immunological hurdles posed, including B cell immunodominance and germinal center (GC) quantity and quality. We found that two independent methods of slow delivery immunization of rhesus monkeys (RMs) resulted in more robust T follicular helper (TFH) cell responses and GC B cells with improved Env-binding, tracked by longitudinal fine needle aspirates. Improved GCs correlated with the development of >20-fold higher titers of autologous nAbs. Using a new RM genomic immunoglobulin locus reference, we identified differential IgV gene use between immunization modalities. Ab mapping demonstrated targeting of immunodominant non-neutralizing epitopes by conventional bolus-immunized animals, whereas slow delivery-immunized animals targeted a more diverse set of epitopes. Thus, alternative immunization strategies can enhance nAb development by altering GCs and modulating the immunodominance of non-neutralizing epitopes.

Abstract: Summary
Xenograft cell transplantation into immunodeficient mice has become the gold standard for assessing pre-clinical efficacy of cancer drugs, yet direct visualization of single-cell phenotypes is difficult. Here, we report an optically-clear prkdc−/−, il2rga−/− zebrafish that lacks adaptive and natural killer immune cells, can engraft a wide array of human cancers at 37°C, and permits the dynamic visualization of single engrafted cells. For example, photoconversion cell-lineage tracing identified migratory and proliferative cell states in human rhabdomyosarcoma, a pediatric cancer of muscle. Additional experiments identified the preclinical efficacy of combination olaparib PARP inhibitor and temozolomide DNA-damaging agent as an effective therapy for rhabdomyosarcoma and visualized therapeutic responses using a four-color FUCCI cell-cycle fluorescent reporter. These experiments identified that combination treatment arrested rhabdomyosarcoma cells in the G2 cell cycle prior to induction of apoptosis. Finally, patient-derived xenografts could be engrafted into our model, opening new avenues for developing personalized therapeutic approaches in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperactivity and disturbances of attention are common behavioral disorders whose underlying cellular and neural circuit causes are not understood. We report the discovery that striatal astrocytes drive such phenotypes through a hitherto unknown synaptic mechanism. We found that striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) triggered astrocyte signaling via γ-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptors. Selective chemogenetic activation of this pathway in striatal astrocytes in vivo resulted in acute behavioral hyperactivity and disrupted attention. Such responses also resulted in upregulation of the synaptogenic cue thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) in astrocytes, increased excitatory synapses, enhanced corticostriatal synaptic transmission, and increased MSN action potential firing in vivo. All of these changes were reversed by blocking TSP1 effects. Our data identify a form of bidirectional neuron-astrocyte communication and demonstrate that acute reactivation of a single latent astrocyte synaptogenic cue alters striatal circuits controlling behavior, revealing astrocytes and the TSP1 pathway as therapeutic targets in hyperactivity, attention deficit, and related psychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence suggests that cancer cells highjack developmental programs for disease initiation and progression. Melanoma arises from melanocytes that originate during development from neural crest stem cells (NCSCs). Here, we identified the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (Yy1) as an NCSCs regulator. Conditional deletion of Yy1 in NCSCs resulted in stage-dependent hypoplasia of all major neural crest derivatives due to decreased proliferation and increased cell death. Moreover, conditional ablation of one Yy1 allele in a melanoma mouse model prevented tumorigenesis, indicating a particular susceptibility of melanoma cells to reduced Yy1 levels. Combined RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq, and untargeted metabolomics demonstrated that YY1 governs multiple metabolic pathways and protein synthesis in both NCSCs and melanoma. In addition to directly regulating a metabolic gene set, YY1 can act upstream of MITF/c-MYC as part of a gene regulatory network controlling metabolism. Thus, both NCSC development and melanoma formation depend on an intricate YY1-controlled metabolic program.

Abstract: Summary
Muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) are the quiescent muscle stem cells required for adult skeletal muscle repair. The impact of environmental stress such as pollution on MuSC behavior remains unexplored. We evaluated the impact of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure, a ubiquitous and highly toxic pollutant, on MuSCs by combining in vivo mouse molecular genetic models with ex vivo studies. While all MuSCs express the transcription factor PAX7, we show that a subset also express PAX3 and exhibit resistance to environmental stress. Upon systemic TCDD treatment, PAX3-negative MuSCs display impaired survival, atypical activation, and sporadic differentiation through xenobiotic aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling. We further show that PAX3-positive MuSCs become sensitized to environmental stress when PAX3 function is impaired and that PAX3-mediated induction of mTORC1 is required for protection. Our study, therefore, identifies a functional heterogeneity of MuSCs in response to environmental stress controlled by PAX3.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence suggests that transcriptional control and chromatin activities at large involve regulatory RNAs, which likely enlist specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Although multiple RBPs have been implicated in transcription control, it has remained unclear how extensively RBPs directly act on chromatin. We embarked on a large-scale RBP ChIP-seq analysis, revealing widespread RBP presence in active chromatin regions in the human genome. Like transcription factors (TFs), RBPs also show strong preference for hotspots in the genome, particularly gene promoters, where their association is frequently linked to transcriptional output. Unsupervised clustering reveals extensive co-association between TFs and RBPs, as exemplified by YY1, a known RNA-dependent TF, and RBM25, an RBP involved in splicing regulation. Remarkably, RBM25 depletion attenuates all YY1-dependent activities, including chromatin binding, DNA looping, and transcription. We propose that various RBPs may enhance network interaction through harnessing regulatory RNAs to control transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression in human tissue has primarily been studied on the transcriptional level, largely neglecting translational regulation. Here, we analyze the translatomes of 80 human hearts to identify new translation events and quantify the effect of translational regulation. We show extensive translational control of cardiac gene expression, which is orchestrated in a process-specific manner. Translation downstream of predicted disease-causing protein-truncating variants appears to be frequent, suggesting inefficient translation termination. We identify hundreds of previously undetected microproteins, expressed from lncRNAs and circRNAs, for which we validate the protein products in vivo. The translation of microproteins is not restricted to the heart and prominent in the translatomes of human kidney and liver. We associate these microproteins with diverse cellular processes and compartments and find that many locate to the mitochondria. Importantly, dozens of microproteins are translated from lncRNAs with well-characterized noncoding functions, indicating previously unrecognized biology.

Abstract: Summary
Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is a devastating, multisystemic disorder caused by recessive mutations in the mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN). FXN participates in the biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters and is considered to be essential for viability. Here we report that when grown in 1% ambient O2, FXN null yeast, human cells, and nematodes are fully viable. In human cells, hypoxia restores steady-state levels of Fe-S clusters and normalizes ATF4, NRF2, and IRP2 signaling events associated with FRDA. Cellular studies and in vitro reconstitution indicate that hypoxia acts through HIF-independent mechanisms that increase bioavailable iron as well as directly activate Fe-S synthesis. In a mouse model of FRDA, breathing 11% O2 attenuates the progression of ataxia, whereas breathing 55% O2 hastens it. Our work identifies oxygen as a key environmental variable in the pathogenesis associated with FXN depletion, with important mechanistic and therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
How the central innate immune protein, STING, is activated by its ligands remains unknown. Here, using structural biology and biochemistry, we report that the metazoan second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP induces closing of the human STING homodimer and release of the STING C-terminal tail, which exposes a polymerization interface on the STING dimer and leads to the formation of disulfide-linked polymers via cysteine residue 148. Disease-causing hyperactive STING mutations either flank C148 and depend on disulfide formation or reside in the C-terminal tail binding site and cause constitutive C-terminal tail release and polymerization. Finally, bacterial cyclic-di-GMP induces an alternative active STING conformation, activates STING in a cooperative manner, and acts as a partial antagonist of 2′3′-cGAMP signaling. Our insights explain the tight control of STING signaling given varying background activation signals and provide a therapeutic hypothesis for autoimmune syndrome treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Ebola virus (EBOV) remains a public health threat. We performed a longitudinal study of B cell responses to EBOV in four survivors of the 2014 West African outbreak. Infection induced lasting EBOV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, but their subclass composition changed over time, with IgG1 persisting, IgG3 rapidly declining, and IgG4 appearing late. Striking changes occurred in the immunoglobulin repertoire, with massive recruitment of naive B cells that subsequently underwent hypermutation. We characterized a large panel of EBOV glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Only a small subset of mAbs that bound glycoprotein by ELISA recognized cell-surface glycoprotein. However, this subset contained all neutralizing mAbs. Several mAbs protected against EBOV disease in animals, including one mAb that targeted an epitope under evolutionary selection during the 2014 outbreak. Convergent antibody evolution was seen across multiple donors, particularly among VH3-13 neutralizing antibodies specific for the GP1 core. Our study provides a benchmark for assessing EBOV vaccine-induced immunity.

Abstract: Summary
In ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), Rqc2/NEMF closely supports the E3 ligase Ltn1/listerin in promoting ubiquitylation and degradation of aberrant nascent-chains obstructing large (60S) ribosomal subunits—products of ribosome stalling during translation. However, while Ltn1 is eukaryote-specific, Rqc2 homologs are also found in bacteria and archaea; whether prokaryotic Rqc2 has an RQC-related function has remained unknown. Here, we show that, as in eukaryotes, a bacterial Rqc2 homolog (RqcH) recognizes obstructed 50S subunits and promotes nascent-chain proteolysis. Unexpectedly, RqcH marks nascent-chains for degradation in a direct manner, by appending C-terminal poly-alanine tails that act as degrons recognized by the ClpXP protease. Furthermore, RqcH acts redundantly with tmRNA/ssrA and protects cells against translational and environmental stresses. Our results uncover a proteolytic-tagging mechanism with implications toward the function of related modifications in eukaryotes and suggest that RQC was already active in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) to help cope with incomplete translation.

Abstract: Summary
The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor whose disruption causes obesity. We functionally characterized 61 MC4R variants identified in 0.5 million people from UK Biobank and examined their associations with body mass index (BMI) and obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases. We found that the maximal efficacy of β-arrestin recruitment to MC4R, rather than canonical Gαs-mediated cyclic adenosine-monophosphate production, explained 88% of the variance in the association of MC4R variants with BMI. While most MC4R variants caused loss of function, a subset caused gain of function; these variants were associated with significantly lower BMI and lower odds of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Protective associations were driven by MC4R variants exhibiting signaling bias toward β-arrestin recruitment and increased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. Harnessing β-arrestin-biased MC4R signaling may represent an effective strategy for weight loss and the treatment of obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we describe the discovery of a naturally occurring human antibody (Ab), FluA-20, that recognizes a new site of vulnerability on the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain and reacts with most influenza A viruses. Structural characterization of FluA-20 with H1 and H3 head domains revealed a novel epitope in the HA trimer interface, suggesting previously unrecognized dynamic features of the trimeric HA protein. The critical HA residues recognized by FluA-20 remain conserved across most subtypes of influenza A viruses, which explains the Ab’s extraordinary breadth. The Ab rapidly disrupted the integrity of HA protein trimers, inhibited cell-to-cell spread of virus in culture, and protected mice against challenge with viruses of H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, or H7N9 subtypes when used as prophylaxis or therapy. The FluA-20 Ab has uncovered an exceedingly conserved protective determinant in the influenza HA head domain trimer interface that is an unexpected new target for anti-influenza therapeutics and vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining the optimal performance of cell processes and organelles is the task of auto-regulatory systems. Here we describe an auto-regulatory device that helps to maintain homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by adjusting the secretory flux to the cargo load. The cargo-recruiting subunit of the coatomer protein II (COPII) coat, Sec24, doubles as a sensor of folded cargo and, upon cargo binding, acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to activate the signaling protein Gα12 at the ER exit sites (ERESs). This step, in turn, activates a complex signaling network that activates and coordinates the ER export machinery and attenuates proteins synthesis, thus preventing large fluctuations of folded and potentially active cargo that could be harmful to the cell or the organism. We call this mechanism AREX (autoregulation of ER export) and expect that its identification will aid our understanding of human physiology and diseases that develop from secretory dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
The cardiogenic transcription factors (TFs) Mef2c, Gata4, and Tbx5 can directly reprogram fibroblasts to induced cardiac-like myocytes (iCLMs), presenting a potential source of cells for cardiac repair. While activity of these TFs is enhanced by Hand2 and Akt1, their genomic targets and interactions during reprogramming are not well studied. We performed genome-wide analyses of cardiogenic TF binding and enhancer profiling during cardiac reprogramming. We found that these TFs synergistically activate enhancers highlighted by Mef2c binding sites and that Hand2 and Akt1 coordinately recruit other TFs to enhancer elements. Intriguingly, these enhancer landscapes collectively resemble patterns of enhancer activation during embryonic cardiogenesis. We further constructed a cardiac reprogramming gene regulatory network and found repression of EGFR signaling pathway genes. Consistently, chemical inhibition of EGFR signaling augmented reprogramming. Thus, by defining epigenetic landscapes these findings reveal synergistic transcriptional activation across a broad landscape of cardiac enhancers and key signaling pathways that govern iCLM reprogramming.

Complementary Activity of ETV5, RBPJ, and TCF3 Drives Formative Transition from Naive Pluripotency,

Abstract: Summary
The gene regulatory network (GRN) of naive mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) must be reconfigured to enable lineage commitment. TCF3 sanctions rewiring by suppressing components of the ESC transcription factor circuitry. However, TCF3 depletion only delays and does not prevent transition to formative pluripotency. Here, we delineate additional contributions of the ETS-family transcription factor ETV5 and the repressor RBPJ. In response to ERK signaling, ETV5 switches activity from supporting self-renewal and undergoes genome relocation linked to commissioning of enhancers activated in formative epiblast. Independent upregulation of RBPJ prevents re-expression of potent naive factors, TBX3 and NANOG, to secure exit from the naive state. Triple deletion of Etv5, Rbpj, and Tcf3 disables ESCs, such that they remain largely undifferentiated and locked in self-renewal, even in the presence of differentiation stimuli. Thus, genetic elimination of three complementary drivers of network transition stalls developmental progression, emulating environmental insulation by small-molecule inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Innate immune responses are intricately linked with intracellular metabolism of myeloid cells. Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation shifts intracellular metabolism toward glycolysis, while anti-inflammatory signals depend on enhanced mitochondrial respiration. How exogenous metabolic signals affect the immune response is unknown. We demonstrate that TLR-dependent responses of dendritic cells (DCs) are exacerbated by a high-fatty-acid (FA) metabolic environment. FAs suppress the TLR-induced hexokinase activity and perturb tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism. These metabolic changes enhance mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production and, in turn, the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to a distinct transcriptomic signature with IL-23 as hallmark. Interestingly, chemical or genetic suppression of glycolysis was sufficient to induce this specific immune response. Conversely, reducing mtROS production or DC-specific deficiency in XBP1 attenuated IL-23 expression and skin inflammation in an IL-23-dependent model of psoriasis. Thus, fine-tuning of innate immunity depends on optimization of metabolic demands and minimization of mtROS-induced UPR.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence indicates a central role for the microbiome in immunity. However, causal evidence in humans is sparse. Here, we administered broad-spectrum antibiotics to healthy adults prior and subsequent to seasonal influenza vaccination. Despite a 10,000-fold reduction in gut bacterial load and long-lasting diminution in bacterial diversity, antibody responses were not significantly affected. However, in a second trial of subjects with low pre-existing antibody titers, there was significant impairment in H1N1-specific neutralization and binding IgG1 and IgA responses. In addition, in both studies antibiotics treatment resulted in (1) enhanced inflammatory signatures (including AP-1/NR4A expression), observed previously in the elderly, and increased dendritic cell activation; (2) divergent metabolic trajectories, with a 1,000-fold reduction in serum secondary bile acids, which was highly correlated with AP-1/NR4A signaling and inflammasome activation. Multi-omics integration revealed significant associations between bacterial species and metabolic phenotypes, highlighting a key role for the microbiome in modulating human immunity.

BMAL1-Driven Tissue Clocks Respond Independently to Light to Maintain Homeostasis,

Abstract: Summary
Circadian rhythms control organismal physiology throughout the day. At the cellular level, clock regulation is established by a self-sustained Bmal1-dependent transcriptional oscillator network. However, it is still unclear how different tissues achieve a synchronized rhythmic physiology. That is, do they respond independently to environmental signals, or require interactions with each other to do so? We show that unexpectedly, light synchronizes the Bmal1-dependent circadian machinery in single tissues in the absence of Bmal1 in all other tissues. Strikingly, light-driven tissue autonomous clocks occur without rhythmic feeding behavior and are lost in constant darkness. Importantly, tissue-autonomous Bmal1 partially sustains homeostasis in otherwise arrhythmic and prematurely aging animals. Our results therefore support a two-branched model for the daily synchronization of tissues: an autonomous response branch, whereby light entrains circadian clocks without any commitment of other Bmal1-dependent clocks, and a memory branch using other Bmal1-dependent clocks to “remember” time in the absence of external cues.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons in cortical circuits are often coactivated as ensembles, yet it is unclear whether ensembles play a functional role in behavior. Some ensemble neurons have pattern completion properties, triggering the entire ensemble when activated. Using two-photon holographic optogenetics in mouse primary visual cortex, we tested whether recalling ensembles by activating pattern completion neurons alters behavioral performance in a visual task. Disruption of behaviorally relevant ensembles by activation of non-selective neurons decreased performance, whereas activation of only two pattern completion neurons from behaviorally relevant ensembles improved performance, by reliably recalling the whole ensemble. Also, inappropriate behavioral choices were evoked by the mistaken activation of behaviorally relevant ensembles. Finally, in absence of visual stimuli, optogenetic activation of two pattern completion neurons could trigger behaviorally relevant ensembles and correct behavioral responses. Our results demonstrate a causal role of neuronal ensembles in a visually guided behavior and suggest that ensembles implement internal representations of perceptual states.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our ability to characterize cell states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns. Our work presents a strategy for the assembly of harmonized references and transfer of information across datasets.

Abstract: Summary
Normal tissues accumulate genetic changes with age, but it is unknown if somatic mutations promote clonal expansion of non-malignant cells in the setting of chronic degenerative diseases. Exome sequencing of diseased liver samples from 82 patients revealed a complex mutational landscape in cirrhosis. Additional ultra-deep sequencing identified recurrent mutations in PKD1, PPARGC1B, KMT2D, and ARID1A. The number and size of mutant clones increased as a function of fibrosis stage and tissue damage. To interrogate the functional impact of mutated genes, a pooled in vivo CRISPR screening approach was established. In agreement with sequencing results, examination of 147 genes again revealed that loss of Pkd1, Kmt2d, and Arid1a promoted clonal expansion. Conditional heterozygous deletion of these genes in mice was also hepatoprotective in injury assays. Pre-malignant somatic alterations are often viewed through the lens of cancer, but we show that mutations can promote regeneration, likely independent of carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Social interactions occur between multiple individuals, but what is the detailed relationship between the neural dynamics across their brains? To address this question across timescales and levels of neural activity, we used wireless electrophysiology to simultaneously record from pairs of bats engaged in a wide range of natural social interactions. We found that neural activity was remarkably correlated between their brains over timescales from seconds to hours. The correlation depended on a shared social environment and was most prominent in high frequency local field potentials (>30 Hz), followed by local spiking activity. Furthermore, the degree of neural correlation covaried with the extent of social interactions, and an increase in correlation preceded their initiation. These results show that inter-brain correlation is an inherent feature of natural social interactions, reveal the domain of neural activity where it is most prominent, and provide a foundation for studying its functional role in social behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
The cancer transcriptome is remarkably complex, including low-abundance transcripts, many not polyadenylated. To fully characterize the transcriptome of localized prostate cancer, we performed ultra-deep total RNA-seq on 144 tumors with rich clinical annotation. This revealed a linear transcriptomic subtype associated with the aggressive intraductal carcinoma sub-histology and a fusion profile that differentiates localized from metastatic disease. Analysis of back-splicing events showed widespread RNA circularization, with the average tumor expressing 7,232 circular RNAs (circRNAs). The degree of circRNA production was correlated to disease progression in multiple patient cohorts. Loss-of-function screening identified 11.3% of highly abundant circRNAs as essential for cell proliferation; for ∼90% of these, their parental linear transcripts were not essential. Individual circRNAs can have distinct functions, with circCSNK1G3 promoting cell growth by interacting with miR-181. These data advocate for adoption of ultra-deep RNA-seq without poly-A selection to interrogate both linear and circular transcriptomes.

Abstract: Summary
Cell fate decisions are governed by sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) that act in small populations of cells within developing embryos. To understand their functions in vivo, it is important to identify TF binding sites in these cells. However, current methods cannot profile TFs genome-wide at or near the single-cell level. Here we adapt the cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) method to profile TFs in low cell numbers, including single cells and individual pre-implantation embryos. Single-cell experiments suggest that only a fraction of TF binding sites are occupied in most cells, in a manner broadly consistent with measurements of peak intensity from multi-cell studies. We further show that chromatin binding by the pluripotency TF NANOG is highly dependent on the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in individual blastocysts but not in cultured cells. Ultra-low input CUT&RUN (uliCUT&RUN) therefore enables interrogation of TF binding from rare cell populations of particular importance in development or disease.

Abstract: Summary
Current machine learning techniques enable robust association of biological signals with measured phenotypes, but these approaches are incapable of identifying causal relationships. Here, we develop an integrated “white-box” biochemical screening, network modeling, and machine learning approach for revealing causal mechanisms and apply this approach to understanding antibiotic efficacy. We counter-screen diverse metabolites against bactericidal antibiotics in Escherichia coli and simulate their corresponding metabolic states using a genome-scale metabolic network model. Regression of the measured screening data on model simulations reveals that purine biosynthesis participates in antibiotic lethality, which we validate experimentally. We show that antibiotic-induced adenine limitation increases ATP demand, which elevates central carbon metabolism activity and oxygen consumption, enhancing the killing effects of antibiotics. This work demonstrates how prospective network modeling can couple with machine learning to identify complex causal mechanisms underlying drug efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence is a tightly regulated process crucial for hematopoietic regeneration, which requires a healthy and supportive microenvironmental niche within the bone marrow (BM). Here, we show that deletion of Ptpn21, a protein tyrosine phosphatase highly expressed in HSCs, induces stem cell egress from the niche due to impaired retention within the BM. Ptpn21−/− HSCs exhibit enhanced mobility, decreased quiescence, increased apoptosis, and defective reconstitution capacity. Ptpn21 deletion also decreased HSC stiffness and increased physical deformability, in part by dephosphorylating Spetin1 (Tyr246), a poorly described component of the cytoskeleton. Elevated phosphorylation of Spetin1 in Ptpn21−/− cells impaired cytoskeletal remodeling, contributed to cortical instability, and decreased cell rigidity. Collectively, these findings show that Ptpn21 maintains cellular mechanics, which is correlated with its important functions in HSC niche retention and preservation of hematopoietic regeneration capacity.

Abstract: Summary
DNA repair has been hypothesized to be a longevity determinant, but the evidence for it is based largely on accelerated aging phenotypes of DNA repair mutants. Here, using a panel of 18 rodent species with diverse lifespans, we show that more robust DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, but not nucleotide excision repair (NER), coevolves with longevity. Evolution of NER, unlike DSB, is shaped primarily by sunlight exposure. We further show that the capacity of the SIRT6 protein to promote DSB repair accounts for a major part of the variation in DSB repair efficacy between short- and long-lived species. We dissected the molecular differences between a weak (mouse) and a strong (beaver) SIRT6 protein and identified five amino acid residues that are fully responsible for their differential activities. Our findings demonstrate that DSB repair and SIRT6 have been optimized during the evolution of longevity, which provides new targets for anti-aging interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Non-alcoholic fatty liver is the most common liver disease worldwide. Here, we show that the mitochondrial protein mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) protects against liver disease. Reduced Mfn2 expression was detected in liver biopsies from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Moreover, reduced Mfn2 levels were detected in mouse models of steatosis or NASH, and its re-expression in a NASH mouse model ameliorated the disease. Liver-specific ablation of Mfn2 in mice provoked inflammation, triglyceride accumulation, fibrosis, and liver cancer. We demonstrate that Mfn2 binds phosphatidylserine (PS) and can specifically extract PS into membrane domains, favoring PS transfer to mitochondria and mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis. Consequently, hepatic Mfn2 deficiency reduces PS transfer and phospholipid synthesis, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the development of a NASH-like phenotype and liver cancer. Ablation of Mfn2 in liver reveals that disruption of ER-mitochondrial PS transfer is a new mechanism involved in the development of liver disease.

Abstract: Summary
We performed a comprehensive assessment of rare inherited variation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by analyzing whole-genome sequences of 2,308 individuals from families with multiple affected children. We implicate 69 genes in ASD risk, including 24 passing genome-wide Bonferroni correction and 16 new ASD risk genes, most supported by rare inherited variants, a substantial extension of previous findings. Biological pathways enriched for genes harboring inherited variants represent cytoskeletal organization and ion transport, which are distinct from pathways implicated in previous studies. Nevertheless, the de novo and inherited genes contribute to a common protein-protein interaction network. We also identified structural variants (SVs) affecting non-coding regions, implicating recurrent deletions in the promoters of DLG2 and NR3C2. Loss of nr3c2 function in zebrafish disrupts sleep and social function, overlapping with human ASD-related phenotypes. These data support the utility of studying multiplex families in ASD and are available through the Hartwell Autism Research and Technology portal.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have strong potential in regenerative medicine applications; however, immune rejection caused by HLA mismatching is a concern. B2M gene knockout and HLA-homozygous iPSC stocks can address this issue, but the former approach may induce NK cell activity and fail to present antigens, and it is challenging to recruit rare donors for the latter method. Here, we show two genome-editing strategies for making immunocompatible donor iPSCs. First, we generated HLA pseudo-homozygous iPSCs with allele-specific editing of HLA heterozygous iPSCs. Second, we generated HLA-C-retained iPSCs by disrupting both HLA-A and -B alleles to suppress the NK cell response while maintaining antigen presentation. HLA-C-retained iPSCs could evade T cells and NK cells in vitro and in vivo. We estimated that 12 lines of HLA-C-retained iPSCs combined with HLA-class II knockout are immunologically compatible with >90% of the world’s population, greatly facilitating iPSC-based regenerative medicine applications.

Abstract: Summary
Hair growth can be induced from resting mouse hair follicles by topical application of JAK inhibitors, suggesting that JAK-STAT signaling is required for maintaining hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) in a quiescent state. Here, we show that Oncostatin M (OSM), an IL-6 family cytokine, negatively regulates hair growth by signaling through JAK-STAT5 to maintain HFSC quiescence. Genetic deletion of the OSM receptor or STAT5 can induce premature HFSC activation, suggesting that the resting telogen stage is actively maintained by the hair follicle niche. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the OSM source is not intrinsic to the hair follicle itself and is instead a subset of TREM2+ macrophages that is enriched within the resting follicle and deceases immediately prior to HFSC activation. In vivo inhibition of macrophage function was sufficient to induce HFSC proliferation and hair cycle induction. Together these results clarify how JAK-STAT signaling actively inhibits hair growth.

Abstract: Summary
Transmission of malaria parasites occurs when a female Anopheles mosquito feeds on an infected host to acquire nutrients for egg development. How parasites are affected by oogenetic processes, principally orchestrated by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), remains largely unknown. Here we show that Plasmodium falciparum development is intimately but not competitively linked to processes shaping Anopheles gambiae reproduction. We unveil a 20E-mediated positive correlation between egg and oocyst numbers; impairing oogenesis by multiple 20E manipulations decreases parasite intensities. These manipulations, however, accelerate Plasmodium growth rates, allowing sporozoites to become infectious sooner. Parasites exploit mosquito lipids for faster growth, but they do so without further affecting egg development. These results suggest that P. falciparum has adopted a non-competitive evolutionary strategy of resource exploitation to optimize transmission while minimizing fitness costs to its mosquito vector. Our findings have profound implications for currently proposed control strategies aimed at suppressing mosquito populations.

Abstract: Summary
Ectopic lipid deposition and altered mitochondrial dynamics contribute to the development of obesity and insulin resistance. However, the mechanistic link between these processes remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that the C16:0 sphingolipid synthesizing ceramide synthases, CerS5 and CerS6, affect distinct sphingolipid pools and that abrogation of CerS6 but not of CerS5 protects from obesity and insulin resistance. We identify proteins that specifically interact with C16:0 sphingolipids derived from CerS5 or CerS6. Here, only CerS6-derived C16:0 sphingolipids bind the mitochondrial fission factor (Mff). CerS6 and Mff deficiency protect from fatty acid-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in vitro, and the two proteins genetically interact in vivo in obesity-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and development of insulin resistance. Our experiments reveal an unprecedented specificity of sphingolipid signaling depending on specific synthesizing enzymes, provide a mechanistic link between hepatic lipid deposition and mitochondrial fragmentation in obesity, and define the CerS6-derived sphingolipid/Mff interaction as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell technologies have described heterogeneity across tissues, but the spatial distribution and forces that drive single-cell phenotypes have not been well defined. Combining single-cell RNA and protein analytics in studying the role of stromal cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in modulating heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [PDAC]) model systems, we have identified significant single-cell population shifts toward invasive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and proliferative (PRO) phenotypes linked with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. Using high-content digital imaging of RNA in situ hybridization in 195 PDAC tumors, we quantified these EMT and PRO subpopulations in 319,626 individual cancer cells that can be classified within the context of distinct tumor gland “units.” Tumor gland typing provided an additional layer of intratumoral heterogeneity that was associated with differences in stromal abundance and clinical outcomes. This demonstrates the impact of the stroma in shaping tumor architecture by altering inherent patterns of tumor glands in human PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
Delineating ecologically meaningful populations among microbes is important for identifying their roles in environmental and host-associated microbiomes. Here, we introduce a metric of recent gene flow, which when applied to co-existing microbes, identifies congruent genetic and ecological units separated by strong gene flow discontinuities from their next of kin. We then develop a pipeline to identify genome regions within these units that show differential adaptation and allow mapping of populations onto environmental variables or host associations. Using this reverse ecology approach, we show that the human commensal bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus breaks up into sharply delineated populations that show different associations with health and disease. Defining populations by recent gene flow in this way will facilitate the analysis of bacterial and archaeal genomes using ecological and evolutionary theory developed for plants and animals, thus allowing for testing unifying principles across all biology.

Abstract: Summary
While Mediator plays a key role in eukaryotic transcription, little is known about its mechanism of action. This study combines CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens, degron assays, Hi-C, and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to dissect the function and structure of mammalian Mediator (mMED). Deletion analyses in B, T, and embryonic stem cells (ESC) identified a core of essential subunits required for Pol II recruitment genome-wide. Conversely, loss of non-essential subunits mostly affects promoters linked to multiple enhancers. Contrary to current models, however, mMED and Pol II are dispensable to physically tether regulatory DNA, a topological activity requiring architectural proteins. Cryo-EM analysis revealed a conserved core, with non-essential subunits increasing structural complexity of the tail module, a primary transcription factor target. Changes in tail structure markedly increase Pol II and kinase module interactions. We propose that Mediator’s structural pliability enables it to integrate and transmit regulatory signals and act as a functional, rather than an architectural bridge, between promoters and enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
Social interactions involve complex decision-making tasks that are shaped by dynamic, mutual feedback between participants. An open question is whether and how emergent properties may arise across brains of socially interacting individuals to influence social decisions. By simultaneously performing microendoscopic calcium imaging in pairs of socially interacting mice, we find that animals exhibit interbrain correlations of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex that are dependent on ongoing social interaction. Activity synchrony arises from two neuronal populations that separately encode one’s own behaviors and those of the social partner. Strikingly, interbrain correlations predict future social interactions as well as dominance relationships in a competitive context. Together, our study provides conclusive evidence for interbrain synchrony in rodents, uncovers how synchronization arises from activity at the single-cell level, and presents a role for interbrain neural activity coupling as a property of multi-animal systems in coordinating and sustaining social interactions between individuals.

Abstract: Summary
PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells binds its receptor PD-1 on effector T cells, thereby suppressing their activity. Antibody blockade of PD-L1 can activate an anti-tumor immune response leading to durable remissions in a subset of cancer patients. Here, we describe an alternative mechanism of PD-L1 activity involving its secretion in tumor-derived exosomes. Removal of exosomal PD-L1 inhibits tumor growth, even in models resistant to anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Exosomal PD-L1 from the tumor suppresses T cell activation in the draining lymph node. Systemically introduced exosomal PD-L1 rescues growth of tumors unable to secrete their own. Exposure to exosomal PD-L1-deficient tumor cells suppresses growth of wild-type tumor cells injected at a distant site, simultaneously or months later. Anti-PD-L1 antibodies work additively, not redundantly, with exosomal PD-L1 blockade to suppress tumor growth. Together, these findings show that exosomal PD-L1 represents an unexplored therapeutic target, which could overcome resistance to current antibody approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Severe obesity is a rapidly growing global health threat. Although often attributed to unhealthy lifestyle choices or environmental factors, obesity is known to be heritable and highly polygenic; the majority of inherited susceptibility is related to the cumulative effect of many common DNA variants. Here we derive and validate a new polygenic predictor comprised of 2.1 million common variants to quantify this susceptibility and test this predictor in more than 300,000 individuals ranging from middle age to birth. Among middle-aged adults, we observe a 13-kg gradient in weight and a 25-fold gradient in risk of severe obesity across polygenic score deciles. In a longitudinal birth cohort, we note minimal differences in birthweight across score deciles, but a significant gradient emerged in early childhood and reached 12 kg by 18 years of age. This new approach to quantify inherited susceptibility to obesity affords new opportunities for clinical prevention and mechanistic assessment.

Abstract: Summary
Oligodendrocytes extend elaborate microtubule arbors that contact up to 50 axon segments per cell, then spiral around myelin sheaths, penetrating from outer to inner layers. However, how they establish this complex cytoarchitecture is unclear. Here, we show that oligodendrocytes contain Golgi outposts, an organelle that can function as an acentrosomal microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). We identify a specific marker for Golgi outposts—TPPP (tubulin polymerization promoting protein)—that we use to purify this organelle and characterize its proteome. In in vitro cell-free assays, recombinant TPPP nucleates microtubules. Primary oligodendrocytes from Tppp knockout (KO) mice have aberrant microtubule branching, mixed microtubule polarity, and shorter myelin sheaths when cultured on 3-dimensional (3D) microfibers. Tppp KO mice exhibit hypomyelination with shorter, thinner myelin sheaths and motor coordination deficits.

Abstract: Summary
The pathological consequences of structural variants disrupting 3D genome organization can be difficult to elucidate in vivo due to differences in gene dosage sensitivity between mice and humans. This is illustrated by branchiooculofacial syndrome (BOFS), a rare congenital disorder caused by heterozygous mutations within TFAP2A, a neural crest regulator for which humans, but not mice, are haploinsufficient. Here, we present a BOFS patient carrying a heterozygous inversion with one breakpoint located within a topologically associating domain (TAD) containing enhancers essential for TFAP2A expression in human neural crest cells (hNCCs). Using patient-specific hiPSCs, we show that, although the inversion shuffles the TFAP2A hNCC enhancers with novel genes within the same TAD, this does not result in enhancer adoption. Instead, the inversion disconnects one TFAP2A allele from its cognate enhancers, leading to monoallelic and haploinsufficient TFAP2A expression in patient hNCCs. Our work illustrates the power of hiPSC differentiation to unveil long-range pathomechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The SOX2 transcription factor is critical for neural stem cell (NSC) maintenance and brain development. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and chromatin interaction analysis (ChIA-PET), we determined genome-wide SOX2-bound regions and Pol II-mediated long-range chromatin interactions in brain-derived NSCs. SOX2-bound DNA was highly enriched in distal chromatin regions interacting with promoters and carrying epigenetic enhancer marks. Sox2 deletion caused widespread reduction of Pol II-mediated long-range interactions and decreased gene expression. Genes showing reduced expression in Sox2-deleted cells were significantly enriched in interactions between promoters and SOX2-bound distal enhancers. Expression of one such gene, Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 (Socs3), rescued the self-renewal defect of Sox2-ablated NSCs. Our work identifies SOX2 as a major regulator of gene expression through connections to the enhancer network in NSCs. Through the definition of such a connectivity network, our study shows the way to the identification of genes and enhancers involved in NSC maintenance and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Early genome-wide association studies (GWASs) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, most of the heritability is due to huge numbers of common variants with tiny effect sizes. Previously, we argued that new models are needed to understand these patterns. Here, we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits are partitioned into direct effects from core genes and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting in trans. We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects. Thus, our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of BRCA1 p220 function often results in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), but the underlying disease mechanism is largely opaque. In mammary epithelial cells (MECs), BRCA1 interacts with multiple proteins, including NUMB and HES1, to form complexes that participate in interstrand crosslink (ICL) DNA repair and MEC differentiation control. Unrepaired ICL damage results in aberrant transdifferentiation to a mesenchymal state of cultured, human basal-like MECs and to a basal/mesenchymal state in primary mouse luminal MECs. Loss of BRCA1, NUMB, or HES1 or chemically induced ICL damage in primary murine luminal MECs results in persistent DNA damage that triggers luminal to basal/mesenchymal transdifferentiation. In vivo single-cell analysis revealed a time-dependent evolution from normal luminal MECs to luminal progenitor-like tumor cells with basal/mesenchymal transdifferentiation during murine BRCA1 BLBC development. Growing DNA damage accompanied this malignant transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical benefits of cytokine blockade in ileal Crohn’s disease (iCD) are limited to a subset of patients. Here, we applied single-cell technologies to iCD lesions to address whether cellular heterogeneity contributes to treatment resistance. We found that a subset of patients expressed a unique cellular module in inflamed tissues that consisted of IgG plasma cells, inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes, activated T cells, and stromal cells, which we named the GIMATS module. Analysis of ligand-receptor interaction pairs identified a distinct network connectivity that likely drives the GIMATS module. Strikingly, the GIMATS module was also present in a subset of patients in four independent iCD cohorts (n = 441), and its presence at diagnosis correlated with failure to achieve durable corticosteroid-free remission upon anti-TNF therapy. These results emphasize the limitations of current diagnostic assays and the potential for single-cell mapping tools to identify novel biomarkers of treatment response and tailored therapeutic opportunities.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death, is triggered by oxidative stress in cancer, heat stress in plants, and hemorrhagic stroke. A homeostatic transcriptional response to ferroptotic stimuli is unknown. We show that neurons respond to ferroptotic stimuli by induction of selenoproteins, including antioxidant glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Pharmacological selenium (Se) augments GPX4 and other genes in this transcriptional program, the selenome, via coordinated activation of the transcription factors TFAP2c and Sp1 to protect neurons. Remarkably, a single dose of Se delivered into the brain drives antioxidant GPX4 expression, protects neurons, and improves behavior in a hemorrhagic stroke model. Altogether, we show that pharmacological Se supplementation effectively inhibits GPX4-dependent ferroptotic death as well as cell death induced by excitotoxicity or ER stress, which are GPX4 independent. Systemic administration of a brain-penetrant selenopeptide activates homeostatic transcription to inhibit cell death and improves function when delivered after hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke.

Abstract: Summary
T and B cells are the two known lineages of adaptive immune cells. Here, we describe a previously unknown lymphocyte that is a dual expresser (DE) of TCR and BCR and key lineage markers of both B and T cells. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), DEs are predominated by one clonotype that encodes a potent CD4 T cell autoantigen in its antigen binding site. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this peptide has an optimal binding register for diabetogenic HLA-DQ8. In concordance, a synthetic version of the peptide forms stable DQ8 complexes and potently stimulates autoreactive CD4 T cells from T1D patients, but not healthy controls. Moreover, mAbs bearing this clonotype are autoreactive against CD4 T cells and inhibit insulin tetramer binding to CD4 T cells. Thus, compartmentalization of adaptive immune cells into T and B cells is not absolute, and violators of this paradigm are likely key drivers of autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Transforming the vast knowledge from genetics, biochemistry, and structural biology into detailed molecular descriptions of biological processes inside cells remains a major challenge—one in sore need of better imaging technologies. For example, transcription involves the complex interplay between RNA polymerase II (Pol II), regulatory factors (RFs), and chromatin, but visualizing these dynamic molecular transactions in their native intracellular milieu remains elusive. Here, we zoom into single tagged genes using nanoscopy techniques, including an active target-locking, ultra-sensitive system that enables single-molecule detection in addressable sub-diffraction volumes, within crowded intracellular environments. We image, track, and quantify Pol II with single-molecule resolution, unveiling its dynamics during the transcription cycle. Further probing multiple functionally linked events—RF-chromatin interactions, Pol II dynamics, and nascent transcription kinetics—reveals detailed operational parameters of gene-regulatory mechanisms hitherto-unseen in vivo. Our approach sets the stage for single-molecule studies of complex molecular processes in live cells.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining proteostasis in eukaryotic protein folding involves cooperation of distinct chaperone systems. To understand how the essential ring-shaped chaperonin TRiC/CCT cooperates with the chaperone prefoldin/GIMc (PFD), we integrate cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), crosslinking-mass-spectrometry and biochemical and cellular approaches to elucidate the structural and functional interplay between TRiC/CCT and PFD. We find these hetero-oligomeric chaperones associate in a defined architecture, through a conserved interface of electrostatic contacts that serves as a pivot point for a TRiC-PFD conformational cycle. PFD alternates between an open “latched” conformation and a closed “engaged” conformation that aligns the PFD-TRiC substrate binding chambers. PFD can act after TRiC bound its substrates to enhance the rate and yield of the folding reaction, suppressing non-productive reaction cycles. Disrupting the TRiC-PFD interaction in vivo is strongly deleterious, leading to accumulation of amyloid aggregates. The supra-chaperone assembly formed by PFD and TRiC is essential to prevent toxic conformations and ensure effective cellular proteostasis.

Abstract: Summary
In situ transgenesis methods such as viruses and electroporation can rapidly create somatic transgenic mice but lack control over copy number, zygosity, and locus specificity. Here we establish mosaic analysis by dual recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (MADR), which permits stable labeling of mutant cells expressing transgenic elements from precisely defined chromosomal loci. We provide a toolkit of MADR elements for combination labeling, inducible and reversible transgene manipulation, VCre recombinase expression, and transgenesis of human cells. Further, we demonstrate the versatility of MADR by creating glioma models with mixed reporter-identified zygosity or with “personalized” driver mutations from pediatric glioma. MADR is extensible to thousands of existing mouse lines, providing a flexible platform to democratize the generation of somatic mosaic mice.

Abstract: Summary
Focal adhesions (FAs) are protein machineries essential for cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Talin is an integrin-activating and tension-sensing FA component directly connecting integrins in the plasma membrane with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. To understand how talin function is regulated, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of full-length talin1 revealing a two-way mode of autoinhibition. The actin-binding rod domains fold into a 15-nm globular arrangement that is interlocked by the integrin-binding FERM head. In turn, the rod domains R9 and R12 shield access of the FERM domain to integrin and the phospholipid PIP2 at the membrane. This mechanism likely ensures synchronous inhibition of integrin, membrane, and cytoskeleton binding. We also demonstrate that compacted talin1 reversibly unfolds to an ∼60-nm string-like conformation, revealing interaction sites for vinculin and actin. Our data explain how fast switching between active and inactive conformations of talin could regulate FA turnover, a process critical for cell adhesion and signaling.

Abstract: Summary
It is unknown whether the activity of the nervous system can be inherited. In Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, parental responses can transmit heritable small RNAs that regulate gene expression transgenerationally. In this study, we show that a neuronal process can impact the next generations. Neurons-specific synthesis of RDE-4-dependent small RNAs regulates germline amplified endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and germline gene expression for multiple generations. Further, the production of small RNAs in neurons controls the chemotaxis behavior of the progeny for at least three generations via the germline Argonaute HRDE-1. Among the targets of these small RNAs, we identified the conserved gene saeg-2, which is transgenerationally downregulated in the germline. Silencing of saeg-2 following neuronal small RNA biogenesis is required for chemotaxis under stress. Thus, we propose a small-RNA-based mechanism for communication of neuronal processes transgenerationally.

Abstract: Summary
Prolonged behavioral challenges can cause animals to switch from active to passive coping strategies to manage effort-expenditure during stress; such normally adaptive behavioral state transitions can become maladaptive in psychiatric disorders such as depression. The underlying neuronal dynamics and brainwide interactions important for passive coping have remained unclear. Here, we develop a paradigm to study these behavioral state transitions at cellular-resolution across the entire vertebrate brain. Using brainwide imaging in zebrafish, we observed that the transition to passive coping is manifested by progressive activation of neurons in the ventral (lateral) habenula. Activation of these ventral-habenula neurons suppressed downstream neurons in the serotonergic raphe nucleus and caused behavioral passivity, whereas inhibition of these neurons prevented passivity. Data-driven recurrent neural network modeling pointed to altered intra-habenula interactions as a contributory mechanism. These results demonstrate ongoing encoding of experience features in the habenula, which guides recruitment of downstream networks and imposes a passive coping behavioral strategy.

Abstract: Summary
The deubiquitinating enzyme BAP1 is a tumor suppressor, among others involved in cholangiocarcinoma. BAP1 has many proposed molecular targets, while its Drosophila homolog is known to deubiquitinate histone H2AK119. We introduce BAP1 loss-of-function by CRISPR/Cas9 in normal human cholangiocyte organoids. We find that BAP1 controls the expression of junctional and cytoskeleton components by regulating chromatin accessibility. Consequently, we observe loss of multiple epithelial characteristics while motility increases. Importantly, restoring the catalytic activity of BAP1 in the nucleus rescues these cellular and molecular changes. We engineer human liver organoids to combine four common cholangiocarcinoma mutations (TP53, PTEN, SMAD4, and NF1). In this genetic background, BAP1 loss results in acquisition of malignant features upon xenotransplantation. Thus, control of epithelial identity through the regulation of chromatin accessibility appears to be a key aspect of BAP1’s tumor suppressor function. Organoid technology combined with CRISPR/Cas9 provides an experimental platform for mechanistic studies of cancer gene function in a human context.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptive immunity provides life-long protection by generating central and effector memory T cells and the most recently described tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells. However, the cellular origin of CD4 TRM cells and their contribution to host defense remain elusive. Using IL-17A tracking-fate mouse models, we found that a significant fraction of lung CD4 TRM cells derive from IL-17A-producing effector (TH17) cells following immunization with heat-killed Klebsiella pneumonia (Kp). These exTH17 TRM cells are maintained in the lung by IL-7, produced by lymphatic endothelial cells. During a memory response, neither antibodies, γδ T cells, nor circulatory T cells are sufficient for the rapid host defense required to eliminate Kp. Conversely, using parabiosis and depletion studies, we demonstrated that exTH17 TRM cells play an important role in bacterial clearance. Thus, we delineate the origin and function of airway CD4 TRM cells during bacterial infection, offering novel strategies for targeted vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
The evolutionary expansion of the mammalian neocortex (Ncx) is thought to be linked to increased proliferative capacity of basal progenitors (BPs) and their neurogenic capacity. Here, by quantifying BP morphology in the developing Ncx of mouse, ferret, and human, we show that increased BP proliferative capacity is linked to an increase in BP process number. We identify human membrane-bound PALMDELPHIN (PALMD-Caax) as an underlying factor, and we show that it drives BP process growth and proliferation when expressed in developing mouse and ferret Ncx. Conversely, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of PALMD or its binding partner ADDUCIN-γ in fetal human Ncx reduces BP process numbers and proliferation. We further show that PALMD-induced processes enable BPs to receive pro-proliferative integrin-dependent signals. These findings provide a link between BP morphology and proliferation, suggesting that changes in BP morphology may have contributed to the evolutionary expansion of the Ncx.

Immune cells residing in white adipose tissue have been highlighted as important factors contributing to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, but the molecular regulators that drive adipose tissue immune cell remodeling during obesity remain largely unknown. Using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all adipose tissue immune populations in both mice and humans during obesity. We describe a novel and conserved Trem2+ lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subset and identify markers, spatial localization, origin, and functional pathways associated with these cells. Genetic ablation of Trem2 in mice globally inhibits the downstream molecular LAM program, leading to adipocyte hypertrophy as well as systemic hypercholesterolemia, body fat accumulation, and glucose intolerance. These findings identify Trem2 signaling as a major pathway by which macrophages respond to loss of tissue-level lipid homeostasis, highlighting Trem2 as a key sensor of metabolic pathologies across multiple tissues and a potential therapeutic target in metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The scaling of organelles with cell size is thought to be exclusive to eukaryotes. Here, we demonstrate that similar scaling relationships hold for the bacterial nucleoid. Despite the absence of a nuclear membrane, nucleoid size strongly correlates with cell size, independent of changes in DNA amount and across various nutrient conditions. This correlation is observed in diverse bacteria, revealing a near-constant ratio between nucleoid and cell size for a given species. As in eukaryotes, the nucleocytoplasmic ratio in bacteria varies greatly among species. This spectrum of nucleocytoplasmic ratios is independent of genome size, and instead it appears linked to the average population cell size. Bacteria with different nucleocytoplasmic ratios have a cytoplasm with different biophysical properties, impacting ribosome mobility and localization. Together, our findings identify new organizational principles and biophysical features of bacterial cells, implicating the nucleocytoplasmic ratio and cell size as determinants of the intracellular organization of translation.

Abstract: Summary
Defining cell types requires integrating diverse single-cell measurements from multiple experiments and biological contexts. To flexibly model single-cell datasets, we developed LIGER, an algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of cell identity. We applied it to four diverse and challenging analyses of human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined region-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Second, we analyzed expression in the human substantia nigra, comparing cell states in specific donors and relating cell types to those in the mouse. Third, we integrated in situ and single-cell expression data to spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse frontal cortex. Finally, we jointly defined mouse cortical cell types using single-cell RNA-seq and DNA methylation profiles, revealing putative mechanisms of cell-type-specific epigenomic regulation. Integrative analyses using LIGER promise to accelerate investigations of cell-type definition, gene regulation, and disease states.

Abstract: Summary
Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance and induction of secondary malignancies limit successful chemotherapy. Because mutagenic translesion synthesis (TLS) contributes to chemoresistance as well as treatment-induced mutations, targeting TLS is an attractive avenue for improving chemotherapeutics. However, development of small molecules with high specificity and in vivo efficacy for mutagenic TLS has been challenging. Here, we report the discovery of a small-molecule inhibitor, JH-RE-06, that disrupts mutagenic TLS by preventing recruitment of mutagenic POL ζ. Remarkably, JH-RE-06 targets a nearly featureless surface of REV1 that interacts with the REV7 subunit of POL ζ. Binding of JH-RE-06 induces REV1 dimerization, which blocks the REV1-REV7 interaction and POL ζ recruitment. JH-RE-06 inhibits mutagenic TLS and enhances cisplatin-induced toxicity in cultured human and mouse cell lines. Co-administration of JH-RE-06 with cisplatin suppresses the growth of xenograft human melanomas in mice, establishing a framework for developing TLS inhibitors as a novel class of chemotherapy adjuvants.

Abstract: Summary
mRNA translation is a key step in decoding genetic information. Genetic decoding is surprisingly heterogeneous because multiple distinct polypeptides can be synthesized from a single mRNA sequence. To study translational heterogeneity, we developed the MoonTag, a fluorescence labeling system to visualize translation of single mRNAs. When combined with the orthogonal SunTag system, the MoonTag enables dual readouts of translation, greatly expanding the possibilities to interrogate complex translational heterogeneity. By placing MoonTag and SunTag sequences in different translation reading frames, each driven by distinct translation start sites, start site selection of individual ribosomes can be visualized in real time. We find that start site selection is largely stochastic but that the probability of using a particular start site differs among mRNA molecules and can be dynamically regulated over time. This study provides key insights into translation start site selection heterogeneity and provides a powerful toolbox to visualize complex translation dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
DNA N6-adenine methylation (6mA) has recently been described in diverse eukaryotes, spanning unicellular organisms to metazoa. Here, we report a DNA 6mA methyltransferase complex in ciliates, termed MTA1c. It consists of two MT-A70 proteins and two homeobox-like DNA-binding proteins and specifically methylates dsDNA. Disruption of the catalytic subunit, MTA1, in the ciliate Oxytricha leads to genome-wide loss of 6mA and abolishment of the consensus ApT dimethylated motif. Mutants fail to complete the sexual cycle, which normally coincides with peak MTA1 expression. We investigate the impact of 6mA on nucleosome occupancy in vitro by reconstructing complete, full-length Oxytricha chromosomes harboring 6mA in native or ectopic positions. We show that 6mA directly disfavors nucleosomes in vitro in a local, quantitative manner, independent of DNA sequence. Furthermore, the chromatin remodeler ACF can overcome this effect. Our study identifies a diverged DNA N6-adenine methyltransferase and defines the role of 6mA in chromatin organization.

Abstract: Summary
Self-renewal and differentiation of pluripotent murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is regulated by extrinsic signaling pathways. It is less clear whether cellular metabolism instructs developmental progression. In an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identified components of a conserved amino-acid-sensing pathway as critical drivers of ESC differentiation. Functional analysis revealed that lysosome activity, the Ragulator protein complex, and the tumor-suppressor protein Folliculin enable the Rag GTPases C and D to bind and seclude the bHLH transcription factor Tfe3 in the cytoplasm. In contrast, ectopic nuclear Tfe3 represses specific developmental and metabolic transcriptional programs that are associated with peri-implantation development. We show differentiation-specific and non-canonical regulation of Rag GTPase in ESCs and, importantly, identify point mutations in a Tfe3 domain required for cytoplasmic inactivation as potentially causal for a human developmental disorder. Our work reveals an instructive and biomedically relevant role of metabolic signaling in licensing embryonic cell fate transitions.

Abstract: Summary
The synchronous cleavage divisions of early embryogenesis require coordination of the cell-cycle oscillator, the dynamics of the cytoskeleton, and the cytoplasm. Yet, it remains unclear how spatially restricted biochemical signals are integrated with physical properties of the embryo to generate collective dynamics. Here, we show that synchronization of the cell cycle in Drosophila embryos requires accurate nuclear positioning, which is regulated by the cell-cycle oscillator through cortical contractility and cytoplasmic flows. We demonstrate that biochemical oscillations are initiated by local Cdk1 inactivation and spread through the activity of phosphatase PP1 to generate cortical myosin II gradients. These gradients cause cortical and cytoplasmic flows that control proper nuclear positioning. Perturbations of PP1 activity and optogenetic manipulations of cortical actomyosin disrupt nuclear spreading, resulting in loss of cell-cycle synchrony. We conclude that mitotic synchrony is established by a self-organized mechanism that integrates the cell-cycle oscillator and embryo mechanics.

Abstract: Summary
We introduce APEX-seq, a method for RNA sequencing based on direct proximity labeling of RNA using the peroxidase enzyme APEX2. APEX-seq in nine distinct subcellular locales produced a nanometer-resolution spatial map of the human transcriptome as a resource, revealing extensive patterns of localization for diverse RNA classes and transcript isoforms. We uncover a radial organization of the nuclear transcriptome, which is gated at the inner surface of the nuclear pore for cytoplasmic export of processed transcripts. We identify two distinct pathways of messenger RNA localization to mitochondria, each associated with specific sets of transcripts for building complementary macromolecular machines within the organelle. APEX-seq should be widely applicable to many systems, enabling comprehensive investigations of the spatial transcriptome.

Abstract: Summary
The vaccine-mediated elicitation of antibodies (Abs) capable of neutralizing diverse HIV-1 strains has been a long-standing goal. To understand how broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can be elicited, we identified, characterized, and tracked five neutralizing Ab lineages targeting the HIV-1-fusion peptide (FP) in vaccinated macaques over time. Genetic and structural analyses revealed two of these lineages to belong to a reproducible class capable of neutralizing up to 59% of 208 diverse viral strains. B cell analysis indicated each of the five lineages to have been initiated and expanded by FP-carrier priming, with envelope (Env)-trimer boosts inducing cross-reactive neutralization. These Abs had binding-energy hotspots focused on FP, whereas several FP-directed Abs induced by immunization with Env trimer-only were less FP-focused and less broadly neutralizing. Priming with a conserved subregion, such as FP, can thus induce Abs with binding-energy hotspots coincident with the target subregion and capable of broad neutralization.

Abstract: Summary
Most patients diagnosed with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) survive less than 5 years, but a minor subset survives longer. Here, we dissect the role of the tumor microbiota and the immune system in influencing long-term survival. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the tumor microbiome composition in PDAC patients with short-term survival (STS) and long-term survival (LTS). We found higher alpha-diversity in the tumor microbiome of LTS patients and identified an intra-tumoral microbiome signature (Pseudoxanthomonas-Streptomyces-Saccharopolyspora-Bacillus clausii) highly predictive of long-term survivorship in both discovery and validation cohorts. Through human-into-mice fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments from STS, LTS, or control donors, we were able to differentially modulate the tumor microbiome and affect tumor growth as well as tumor immune infiltration. Our study demonstrates that PDAC microbiome composition, which cross-talks to the gut microbiome, influences the host immune response and natural history of the disease.

Abstract: Summary
Vaccines to generate durable humoral immunity against antigenically evolving pathogens such as the influenza virus must elicit antibodies that recognize conserved epitopes. Analysis of single memory B cells from immunized human donors has led us to characterize a previously unrecognized epitope of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) that is immunogenic in humans and conserved among influenza subtypes. Structures show that an unrelated antibody from a participant in an experimental infection protocol recognized the epitope as well. IgGs specific for this antigenic determinant do not block viral infection in vitro, but passive administration to mice affords robust IgG subtype-dependent protection against influenza infection. The epitope, occluded in the pre-fusion form of HA, is at the contact surface between HA head domains; reversible molecular “breathing” of the HA trimer can expose the interface to antibody and B cells. Antigens that present this broadly immunogenic HA epitope may be good candidates for inclusion in “universal” flu vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Microbes drive most ecosystems and are modulated by viruses that impact their lifespan, gene flow, and metabolic outputs. However, ecosystem-level impacts of viral community diversity remain difficult to assess due to classification issues and few reference genomes. Here, we establish an ∼12-fold expanded global ocean DNA virome dataset of 195,728 viral populations, now including the Arctic Ocean, and validate that these populations form discrete genotypic clusters. Meta-community analyses revealed five ecological zones throughout the global ocean, including two distinct Arctic regions. Across the zones, local and global patterns and drivers in viral community diversity were established for both macrodiversity (inter-population diversity) and microdiversity (intra-population genetic variation). These patterns sometimes, but not always, paralleled those from macro-organisms and revealed temperate and tropical surface waters and the Arctic as biodiversity hotspots and mechanistic hypotheses to explain them. Such further understanding of ocean viruses is critical for broader inclusion in ecosystem models.

Abstract: Summary
The specific cellular physiology of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is underexplored, and their maintenance in vitro remains challenging. We discovered that culture of HSCs in low calcium increased their maintenance as determined by phenotype, function, and single-cell expression signature. HSCs are endowed with low intracellular calcium conveyed by elevated activity of glycolysis-fueled plasma membrane calcium efflux pumps and a low-bone-marrow interstitial fluid calcium concentration. Low-calcium conditions inhibited calpain proteases, which target ten-eleven translocated (TET) enzymes, of which TET2 was required for the effect of low calcium conditions on HSC maintenance in vitro. These observations reveal a physiological feature of HSCs that can be harnessed to improve their maintenance in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-autonomous Wnt signaling has well-characterized functions in controlling stem cell activity, including in the prostate. While niche cells secrete Wnt ligands, the effects of Wnt signaling in niche cells per se are less understood. Here, we show that stromal cells in the proximal prostatic duct near the urethra, a mouse prostate stem cell niche, not only produce multiple Wnt ligands but also exhibit strong Wnt/β-catenin activity. The non-canonical Wnt ligand Wnt5a, secreted by proximal stromal cells, directly inhibits proliefration of prostate epithelial stem or progenitor cells whereas stromal cell-autonomous canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling indirectly suppresses prostate stem or progenitor activity via the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway. Collectively, these pathways restrain the proliferative potential of epithelial cells in the proximal prostatic ducts. Human prostate likewise exhibits spatially restricted distribution of stromal Wnt/β-catenin activity, suggesting a conserved mechanism for tissue patterning. Thus, this study shows how distinct stromal signaling mechanisms within the prostate cooperate to regulate tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
During neural tube closure and spinal cord development, many cells die in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS, respectively). However, myeloid-derived professional phagocytes have not yet colonized the trunk region during early neurogenesis. How apoptotic cells are removed from this region during these stages remains largely unknown. Using live imaging in zebrafish, we demonstrate that neural crest cells (NCCs) respond rapidly to dying cells and phagocytose cellular debris around the neural tube. Additionally, NCCs have the ability to enter the CNS through motor exit point transition zones and clear debris in the spinal cord. Surprisingly, NCCs phagocytosis mechanistically resembles macrophage phagocytosis and their recruitment toward cellular debris is mediated by interleukin-1β. Taken together, our results reveal a role for NCCs in phagocytosis of debris in the developing nervous system before the presence of professional phagocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Antibacterial autophagy (xenophagy) is an important host defense, but how it is initiated is unclear. Here, we performed a bacterial transposon screen and identified a T3SS effector SopF that potently blocked Salmonella autophagy. SopF was a general xenophagy inhibitor without affecting canonical autophagy. S. Typhimurium ΔsopF resembled S. flexneri ΔvirAΔicsB with the majority of intracellular bacteria targeted by autophagy, permitting a CRISPR screen that identified host V-ATPase as an essential factor. Upon bacteria-caused vacuolar damage, the V-ATPase recruited ATG16L1 onto bacteria-containing vacuole, which was blocked by SopF. Mammalian ATG16L1 bears a WD40 domain required for interacting with the V-ATPase. Inhibiting autophagy by SopF promoted S. Typhimurium proliferation in vivo. SopF targeted Gln124 of ATP6V0C in the V-ATPase for ADP-ribosylation. Mutation of Gln124 also blocked xenophagy, but not canonical autophagy. Thus, the discovery of SopF reveals the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis that critically mediates autophagic recognition of intracellular pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
We previously reported that inducing gamma oscillations with a non-invasive light flicker (gamma entrainment using sensory stimulus or GENUS) impacted pathology in the visual cortex of Alzheimer’s disease mouse models. Here, we designed auditory tone stimulation that drove gamma frequency neural activity in auditory cortex (AC) and hippocampal CA1. Seven days of auditory GENUS improved spatial and recognition memory and reduced amyloid in AC and hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. Changes in activation responses were evident in microglia, astrocytes, and vasculature. Auditory GENUS also reduced phosphorylated tau in the P301S tauopathy model. Furthermore, combined auditory and visual GENUS, but not either alone, produced microglial-clustering responses, and decreased amyloid in medial prefrontal cortex. Whole brain analysis using SHIELD revealed widespread reduction of amyloid plaques throughout neocortex after multi-sensory GENUS. Thus, GENUS can be achieved through multiple sensory modalities with wide-ranging effects across multiple brain areas to improve cognitive function.
