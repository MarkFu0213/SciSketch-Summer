Abstract: Objective
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the R form of α-lipoic acid (RLA) in cellular models of PD induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).
Methods
Cell viability and apoptosis were detected using CCK8 and Annexin V-FITC assays, respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by fluorescence staining. ELISA assays were performed to detect the levels of dopamine and α-synuclein. To evaluate the effects of RLA on mitochondrial function, cytotoxicity, ATP levels, and mitochondrial gene expression were assayed. Additionally, the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins, including Parkin, PINK1, p62, ATG12, and LC3, were analyzed by western blot, and cell autophagy was visualized by immunofluorescence.
Results
RLA increased cell viability and decreased apoptosis, intracellular ROS, and cytotoxicity, and induced cell autophagy in PD models induced by 6-OHDA and MPTP. RLA also reversed the decreased dopamine and increased α-synuclein expression induced by 6-OHDA and MPTP. The mitochondrial regulatory protein PGC-1α was significantly up-regulated by RLA. The expression levels of autophagy-related proteins, including Parkin, PINK1, p62, and ATG12, were down-regulated after RLA treatment, while LC3 expression was up-regulated.
Conclusions
RLA has a protective effect against cellular damage induced by 6-OHDA and MPTP. The neuroprotective mechanism of RLA may be associated with improvement of mitochondrial function and autophagy. Therefore, RLA may serve as a promising potential adjuvant for PD treatment.

Abstract: We here report methylammonium lead-iodide-based perovskite solar cells (psSCs) in which a TiO2 layer (a de-facto electron transport layer of psSCs) is replaced with a layer of C60 evaporated onto indium tin oxide layers covered with polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) layers. Unlike TiO2 layers requiring a high-temperature sintering, C60 is deposited while the substrate is held at room temperature, making it compatible with various plastic substrates for flexible psSCs. The PEIE layers are shown to play key roles, not only as an electron-collecting interfacial layer but also as a surface modifier that helps maintain the integrity of the C60 layers during spin-coating of the perovskite active layers. Using the proposed device architecture, we demonstrate flexible psSCs that exhibit power conversion efficiency as high as 13.3% with low hysteresis.

Abstract: In this work the differences between two electron transporting materials used as n-type selective contacts for perovskite solar cells cells based on CH3NH3PbI3-xClx are evaluated: the classical titanium dioxide (TiO2) and tungsten oxide (WO3) as a potential alternative. WO3 presents the advantage of being printable and does not require high annealing temperature: allowing cheap, expendable and efficient solar cells. Although few reports have demonstrated the strong potentialities of WO3 as efficient electron transporting layer for perovskite solar cells, we specifically focus our analysis on its influence on device stability. In this context, while solar cell performance under ambient conditions and continuous standard illumination is rapidly decreasing in the presence of WO3, we observe a drastic improvement of device stability in the dark under ambient conditions of WO3-based devices compared to TiO2. Exploiting Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) the lower open-circuit voltage is explained, through transient photoluminescence measurements the crucial role played by oxygen vacancies and moisture is pointed out to rationalize this behavior. Finally, demonstrations of perovskite solar cells containing spincoated or printed WO3 processed under ambient condition and presenting power conversion efficiency close to 10% are provided.

Abstract: A novel Cu2O/{101}TiO2 nanosheet (Cu2O/{101}TNS) array film was prepared by the electrodeposition of Cu2O on the {101} facets of anatase nanosheet arrays by varying electrodeposition potential. The crystal structure, morphology, elemental chemical states, optical properties, photoelectrochemical properties, and stability of Cu2O/{101}TNS array films were investigated in detail. For TNS, due to different band structures and band edge positions between {001} and {101} facets, Cu2O/{101} facets of TiO2 have higher band offset value which supply a larger driving force to increase the transport efficiency of carriers. Besides, owing to the directional flow of photo-generated electrons from {001} to {101} facets, the electrodeposition of Cu2O on the {101} facets of TNS will shorten the route length that the electrons must travel, thus reduce recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. In addition, as the applied negative potential is high enough, a part of Cu+ is reduced to Cu, which is beneficial for the photoexcited electrons transfer from CB of Cu2O to that of TiO2. The enhanced photoelectrochemical properties of Cu2O/{101}TNS array films can be attributed to the cocontributions of different band edge positions between {001} and {101} facets, Cu2O-Cu-TiO2 ternary components and vertically aligned single-crystal TiO2 nanosheet structure.

Abstract: Objective/background
Noninfection-related fever can occur after peripheral blood stem cell infusion in haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with post-transplant cyclophosphamide. The objective of this study was to analyze the incidence of fever and characterize some clinical features of affected patients.
Methods
A retrospective case-series study with 40 patients who received haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was carried out.
Results
Thirty-three patients (82.5%) developed fever; no baseline characteristic was associated with its development. Median time to fever onset was 25.5h (range, 9.5–100h) and median peak temperature was 39.0°C (range, 38.1–40.5°C). Not a single patient developed hemodynamic or respiratory compromise that required admission to the intensive care unit. Fever was not explained by infection in any case. Ninety-one percent of the febrile episodes resolved within 96h of cyclophosphamide administration. No significant difference in overall survival, event-free survival, or graft versus host disease-free/relapse-free survival was found in the group of febrile individuals after peripheral blood stem cell infusion.
Conclusion
Fever after peripheral blood stem cell infusion in this clinical setting was common; it usually subsides with cyclophosphamide administration. The development of fever was not associated with an adverse prognosis.

Abstract: This study reports the synthesis of a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) with enhanced ion transport characteristic, based on the composite polymer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and succinonitrile (SN). Moreover, to demonstrate the practical applications, the GPE was applied to the assembly of the electrochromic devices (ECDs) with both glass and plastic substrates. In this composite polymer electrolyte, PMMA served as the polymer matrix and propylene carbonate (PC) was used as the plasticizer, which also provided better dispersion of the plastic crystal SN within PMMA. The composition ratio of PC to SN was investigated by measuring the ionic conductivity of the GPEs. The optimized ratio of PC to SN was 4:1 with an ionic conductivity of 1.46 mS·cm−1. For the fabrication of the ECDs, tungsten oxide (WO3) was used as the cathodic coloring film, which is fabricated by pulsed dc magnetron reactive sputtering. Prussian Blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) were synthesized and coated on the transparent Sn-doped indium oxide (ITO) substrates for the anodic coloring material. The performance of the 5×5cm2 WO3-PBNPs ECD was confirmed by observing its spectroelectrochemical behaviors. This quasi-solid-state ECD fabricated with the PMMA-SN composite polymer showed an optical contrast of 52.4% at 695nm. The optical transmittance of the ECD could be reversibly modulated from 57.9% (bleached) to 5.5% (darkened) at 695nm, by applying potentials of 1.8 and −2.0V, respectively. During the durability test, the transmittance change (ΔT) of this ECD remained 44.5% after 2250 cycles, which was 85% of its original.

Abstract: Combining the high photocatalytic activity of P25 (anatase/rutile bi-phase nanoparticle) and the good recycling property of TiO2 nanobelts is a promising approach for the preparation of high performance photocatalysts. In this work, through controlling the volume ratio of the component of organic solvent, bi-phase ultrathin TiO2 nanobelts consisting of both anatase and rutile phases have been successfully synthesized via a one-step solvothermal process by using tetrabutyl titanate as the Ti source and acetic acid/N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as the blended organic solvent. Compared with single phase TiO2, the bi-phase TiO2 nanobelts display a superior photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet light irradiation. Based on the refinement result of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of TiO2 nanobelts, the ratio of anatase and rutile phases in the as-synthesized TiO2 nanobelts were calculated to be 90.8wt% and 9.2wt%, respectively. Scanning electron microscope and high resolution transmission electron microscope images demonstrated that the thickness of the nanobelts is only 3–5nm, and the main exposed facet is (010), a photocatalytically active facet of anatase. The bi-phase and active facet exposure characteristics endow the ultrathin TiO2 nanobelt with high photocatalytic activity, which is superior to P25. The PdO/TiO2 ultrathin nanobelt heterostructures were synthesized at ambient temperature by using ultrathin nanobelts as substrates, which exhibited outstanding photodegradation activity with methyl orange, excellent hydrogen generation, and observably enhanced photoelectrochemical activity under simulated solar irradiation. The efficient suppression of the recombination of photo-induced carriers was caused by the bi-phase characteristics of the ultrathin TiO2 nanobelts. These nanobelts will have great potential in applications for photocatalytic water treatment and hydrogen generation because of the facile synthesis process and superior photocatalytic activity.

Abstract: Highly conductive nominally undoped ZnO (b-ZnO), obtained by means of an additional plasma near the substrate during sputter deposition, represent an attractive alternative for ZnO:Al (AZO) commonly employed in transparent windows of thin film solar cells. b-ZnO layers exhibit more than twice higher charge carrier mobility in comparison to AZO layers of the same resistivity (1·10−3Ωcm). In consequence, a better transparency in near infrared region and an enhanced short circuit current can be achieved for low band gap thin film solar cells. Replacement of AZO for b-ZnO thus enhances their energy output. In order to allow assessment of suitability of these b-ZnO films for deployment in photovoltaic industry, we examine their stability in various environments, and show pathways to improve it. We demonstrate that the b-ZnO films can exhibit comparable stability to ZnO:Al films in both ambient and heated air over the period of 24 months. However, the examined b-ZnO films degrade faster in accelerated open damp heat (DH) conditions, which we attribute to the lower compactness of columnar microstructure. In order to circumvent this limitation, we introduce a novel multilayered b-ZnO film with an improved environmental stability, as verified by the enhanced optoelectrical performance of DH-treated Cu(InGa)(SSe)2 solar cells.

Increasing NO level regulates apoptosis and inflammation in macrophages after 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulphide challenge,

Abstract: Generation of nitric oxide (NO) in cellular compartments acts in a redox-dependent manner to counteract oxidative stress either by directly acting as an antioxidant through scavenging superoxide anions (O2−), to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−) or acting as a signaling molecule, altering gene expression that triggers various physiological processes. However, the molecular mechanisms of macrophage activation and NO production leads to apoptosis and inflammation after 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulphide (CEES) exposure remains unclear. We showed that CEES exposure in macrophages increased the O2− production. Also CEES exposure transiently increases the NO production and ONOO− accumulation via expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Simultaneously, CEES exposure caused a significant reduction in cellular antioxidants and modulate lipid peroxidation (LPO), and protein carbonylation (PC) reactions, which was correlated with the increased level of NO and ONOO− accumulation. Mechanistic studies showed the DNA damage, 8-oxoGDNA glycosylase (OGG1) down regulation and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) accumulations in DNA, which was also confirmed by phosphorylation of ATM, ATR and H2A.X. Elevated levels of NO/ONOO− plays an important role in apoptosis, and alteration of cell cycle regulatory proteins in macrophages after CEES exposure. Moreover, CEES exposure to macrophage cells enhanced the transcriptional activities of inflammatory mediators such as TNFα, IL-1α, ICAM, CX3CL1, CCL8, and CXCL10, which were linked with NO/ONOO− accumulation. These results showed a mechanistic explanation of how NO/ONOO− cooperate to conduct apoptosis and inflammatory signals in macrophages after CEES challenged. Further, the protective effects of NO/ONOO− inhibitors may provide the basis for the development of a therapeutic strategy to counteract exposure to CEES.

Abstract: The forkhead transcription factor FOXK2 has been implicated in the progression of human cancers, but its role and clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been explored. Here we showed that FOXK2 expression was increased and associated with tumor size, TNM stage and vascular invasion. High FOXK2 expression was correlated with poor overall and disease-free survival in two independent cohorts consisting of 864 patients with HCC. The prognostic value of FOXK2 was validated by stratified survival analyses in subgroups difined by factors contributing to worse survival. Multivariate Cox regression model revealed that FOXK2 served as an independent factor for overall survival. The FOXK2 expression was reversely connected with miR-1271-5p in clinical samples. Re-introduction of miR-1271 decreased FOXK2 at both mRNA and protein levels. Luciferase assay confirmed that FOXK2 was a direct target of miR-1271 in HCC cells. Overexpression of FOXK2 enhanced the cell growth and migration, whereas FOXK2 silence resulted in the opposite phenotypes. Further studies demonstrated that FOXK2 exerted oncogenic activity via activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Collectively, our data suggest FOXK2 as an oncogene and a promising prognostic biomarker in HCC. Targeting the newly identified miR-1271/FOXK2/AKT axis may represent a potential strategy for HCC intervention.

The HDAC inhibitor SAHA does not rescue CFTR membrane expression in Cystic Fibrosis,

Abstract: The development of suitable Cystic Fibrosis (CF) models for preclinical bench tests of therapeutic candidates is challenging. Indeed, the validation of molecules to rescue the p.Phe508del-CFTR channel (encoded by the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator gene carrying the p.Phe508del mutation) requires taking into account their overall effects on the epithelium. Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), was previously shown to be a CFTR corrector via proteostasis modulation in CFTR-deficient immortalized cells. Here, we tested SAHA effects on goblet cell metaplasia using an ex vivo model based on the air-liquid interface (ALI) culture of differentiated airway epithelial cells obtained by nasal scraping from CF patients and healthy controls. Ex vivo epithelium grew successfully in ALI cultures with significant rise in the expression of CFTR and of markers of airway epithelial differentiation compared to monolayer cell culture. SAHA decreased CFTR transcript and protein levels in CF and non-CF epithelia. Whereas SAHA induced lysine hyperacetylation, it did not change histone modifications at the CFTR promoter. SAHA reduced MUC5AC and MUC5B expression and inhibited goblet epithelial cell differentiation. Similar effects were obtained in CF and non-CF epithelia. All the effects were fully reversible within five days from SAHA withdrawal. We conclude that, ex vivo, SAHA modulate the structure of airway epithelia without specific effect on CFTR gene and protein suggesting that HDACi cannot be useful for CF treatment.

Abstract: The optical performance of poly(methyl methacrylate) lenses from veteran concentrator photovoltaic modules was examined after the end of their service life. Lenses from the Martin-Marietta and Intersol module designs were examined from the “Solar Village” site near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as well as the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, followed by the Arizona Public Service Solar Test and Research (APS-STaR) center in Tempe, Arizona. The various lens specimens were deployed for 20, 27, and 22 years, respectively. Optical characterizations included lens efficiency (Solar Simulator instrument), material transmittance and haze (of coupons cut from veteran lenses, then measured again after their faceted back surface was polished, and then measured again after the incident front surface was polished), and direct transmittance (as a function of detector's acceptance angle, using the Very Low Angular Beam Spread (“VLABS”) instrument). Lens efficiency measurements compared the central region to the entire lens, also using hot and cold mirror measurements to diagnose differences in performance. A series of subsequent characterizations was performed because a decrease in performance of greater than 10% was observed for some of the veteran lenses. The optimal focal distance of the lenses was quantified using the Solar Simulator, and then correlated to lens curvature using a recently developed measurement technique. Surface roughness was examined using atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Facet geometry (tip and valley radius) was quantified on cross-sectioned specimens. Molecular weight was compared between the incident and faceted surfaces of the lenses.

Abstract: Abstract–––
The present work is focused on thermochemical energy storage (TCES) in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants by means of the Calcium-Looping (CaL) process using cheap, abundant and non-toxic natural carbonate minerals. CaL conditions for CSP storage involve calcination of CaCO3 in the solar receiver at relatively low temperature whereas carbonation of CaO is carried out at high temperature and high CO2 concentration to use the heat of reaction for power production by means of a CO2 closed power cycle. Under these conditions, large CaO particles derived from limestone to be used in industrial processes are rapidly deactivated due to pore-plugging, which limits the extent of the reaction. This is favored by the relatively small pores of the CaO skeleton generated by low temperature calcination, the large thickness of the CaCO3 layer built upon the CaO surface and the very fast carbonation kinetics. On the other hand, at CaL conditions for CSP storage does not limit carbonation of CaO derived from dolomite (dolime). Dolime is shown to exhibit a high multicycle conversion regardless of particle size, which is explained by the presence of inert MgO grains that allow the reacting gas to percolate inside the porous particles.

Abstract: Free-standing, micrometer long TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiNTs) were synthesized via anodization by utilizing selected transition metals and non-transition elements as cathode materials. Free-standing TiNTs arrays with the maximum tube length up to 153µm was fabricated with Ti cathode material, whereas, the cost effective cathodes materials of charcoal and graphite pencil yielded nearly 100µm long nanotubes for an anodization time of 48h. The barrier layer was removed from the bottom of the free-standing TiNT arrays using chemical etching process. The as-synthesized open ended free-standing amorphous arrays were then crystallized into anatase phase. The annealed free-standing TiNT array was powdered and mixed with TiO2 nanoparticles (NP) to form TiNT/TiO2 NP composite and then utilized as photoanodes to fabricate dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The J-V characteristics and the performances of the solar cells were studied and compared. The results indicate that the TiNT arrays developed with different cathode materials are similar to or in some cases superior to those nanotubes obtained using Pt cathode. Thus, the strategy employed in this work provides a simple, efficient and economical fabrication method for large scale production of TiNT arrays.

Abstract: To make full use of the NIR spectrum, the three-junction (3J) solar cells with bandgaps of 1.9/1.4/1.0eV have been transfer-printed on top of microscale Ge solar cells with two different interfacial materials. The interfacial material consisting of TiO2/SiO2/TiO2 trilayer has been used for the first time and hold about 15% averaged reflection comparable to As2Se3 in the NIR range of 1200–1800nm, which means that the trilayer is of high crystalline quality with gradually varied refractive index and acting as the role of light-trapping to reduce interfacial reflection. Measured EQE curves over a standard AM1.5D spectrum yield a short-circuit current density of 7mA/cm2 for Ge cells with both As2Se3 and trilayer, which means that the trilayer is qualified for replacing As2Se3 with outstanding antireflective properties. NIR optical images have confirmed the existence of air gaps between interfaces of some cells, which exhibit similar response to those without air gaps in the measurements of reflectance and EQE curves, showing great accommodation in mass production of this multijunction architecture.

Abstract: Potential-induced degradation (PID) in photovoltaic (PV) modules based on n-type single-crystalline Si solar cells (a bifacial cell, interdigitated back contact cells, and a hetero junction (HJ) cell) was experimentally investigated by applying high voltages to the modules. The power output of a PV module with an n-type bifacial-front junction (FJ) Si solar cell decreased by about 17% by applying −1000V at 85°C for 10min, whereas no degradation was observed by applying +1000V at 85°C for 10min. The spectrum of external quantum efficiency and transient absorption kinetics of the module after PID tests indicated that surface charge recombination between electron and hole on the Si cell was enhanced. PID in n-type Si PV modules can be approximately explained by surface polarization enhancing front surface recombination on Si cells, which corresponds to a loss of passivation effect by a silicon nitride (SiNx) layer. On the other hand, no PID was observed in a PV module with an n-type bifacial-rear junction (RJ) Si solar cell and a commercial PV module based on an HJ cell by applying both positive and negative voltages. High conductive layers of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) on the top of HJ Si solar cells would significantly effective to suppress PID in n-type Si PV modules.

Abstract: Traditional p-i-n junction solar cells imbedded with quantum dots are attractive to achieve chromatic light absorption enhancement. In this paper, multi-layer stacked GaAs and In0.1Ga0.9As quantum dots grown by the droplet epitaxy technique are sandwiched between Al0.4Ga0.6As layers for solar energy harvesting. The performance of GaAs and InGaAs quantum dot solar cells is compared using structural, optical, and electrical measurements. The two-step photon absorption process is studied via adding external infrared pumping sources in quantum efficiency measurements at room temperature. This work demonstrates that strain-free nanostructures by droplet epitaxy are promising for photovoltaic application.

Abstract: Hierarchical titanium oxide nanostructures were synthesized by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) and investigated as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. An explorative combined approach to enhance TiO2 performance was based, on the one hand, on the employment of hydrogenation treatments with the aim of improving quantum efficiency and extending light absorption to the visible range; on the other hand, on the optimization of morphology and structure, to increase light harvesting and charge separation/transport. This approach was pursued by depositing at a fixed background pressure with variable oxygen content (to control the growth morphology and structure) and by annealing in a Ar/H2 mixture (in substitution of or in combination with air annealing), in order to induce crystallization to the anatase structure and reduction/hydrogenation of the material. Morphology, structure and optical properties were investigated by SEM, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and UV–visible-IR spectroscopy. An optical absorption tail towards the visible range appeared after Ar/H2 annealing, without any significant modification of the nanoscale structure after the different thermal treatments. Photocurrent measurements under solar simulator illumination showed a noteworthy increase of photoresponse for Ar/O2-deposited samples with air annealing followed by Ar/H2 annealing. These findings can be ascribed to the combination between an improved charge transport of TiO2 deposited in low-O2 atmosphere and a hydrogenation effect on the nanostructures surface layers, leading to improved quantum efficiency.

Abstract: Increased interest in novel substrates for III-V material growth has led to the use of alloy fractions other than those lattice-matched to traditional GaAs and Ge substrates. The optical constants of these materials are generally not available in the literature. We characterise the unconventional alloy fractions used in a GaAsP/SiGe tandem on Si by spectroscopic ellipsometry on specially prepared samples, with consideration of transparent and opaque spectral regions during analysis. Complex indices of refraction for GaAs.84P.16,Ga.59In.41P, and Al.65In.35P are determined. These values allow improvement of the solar cell and will enable future optical modelling and design of this and other devices and materials.

Abstract: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis in infancy, which is a major risk factor for recurrent wheezing and asthma. Orosomucoid 1-like protein 3 (ORMDL3) has been reported to associate with virus-triggered recurrent wheezing and asthma in children. However, little is known about how ORMDL3 is involved into RSV infection. In this study, we showed that the mRNA expression of ORMDL3 is significantly increased in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of infants with RSV-induced bronchiolitis compared with uninfected controls, also increased in bronchial epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts following RSV infection in vitro. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of RSV-induced ORMDL3 expression, we performed in silico analysis of the binding sites of several transcription factors in the ORMDL3 promoter. The proximal interferon-regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) binding site positively regulated ORMDL3 transcription following exposure to RSV, as determined through mutational analysis. Overexpression and RNA interference experiments targeting IRF-3 showed that it regulates the expression of ORMDL3 following RSV exposure. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that IRF-3 binds directly to the promoter of the ORMDL3 gene. Furthermore, we confirmed that expression of IRF-3 is significantly increased and shows a strong linear correlation with increased ORMDL3 in the peripheral blood lymphocytes from infants with RSV-induced bronchiolitis. Our results indicate that IRF-3 is an important regulator of ORMDL3 induction following RSV infection by binding directly to the promoter of ORMDL3, which may be implicated in the inflammatory and immune reactions involved in bronchiolitis and wheezing diseases.

Abstract: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a metabolic disorder, is one of the leading causes of mortality around the world and its pathogenesis involves cardiac inflammation and altered metabolic profile. Altered fatty acid metabolism during DCM can cause macrophage polarization in which inflammatory M1 phenotype dominates over the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Hence, it is essential to identify a specific target, which could revert the metabolic profile and thereby reducing the M1 macrophage polarization. 14-3-3η protein has several cellular protective functions especially in the heart as plenty of reports available in various animal models of heart failure including diabetes mellitus. However, its role in the cardiac fatty acid metabolism and macrophage polarization remains unidentified. The present study has been designed to delineate the effect of cardiospecific dominant negative mutation of 14-3-3η protein (DN14-3-3) on various lipid metabolism related marker proteins expressions and cardiac macrophage phenotype in high fat diet (HFD) fed mice. Feeding HFD for 12 weeks has produced significant increase in body weight in the DN14-3-3 (TG) mice than C57BL6/J (WT) mice. Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining analysis of the heart tissue has revealed an increase in the expression of markers of cardiac fatty acid synthesis related proteins in addition to the reduced expression of fatty acid oxidation related proteins in TG mice fed HFD than WT mice fed HFD. Furthermore, the M1 macrophage marker proteins were increasingly expressed while M2 markers expressions were reduced in the hearts of TG mice fed HFD. In conclusion, our current study has identified that there is a definite role for the 14-3-3η protein against the pathogenesis of heart failure via regulation of cardiac fatty acid metabolism and macrophage polarization.

Abstract: Replacing expensive silver with inexpensive copper for the metallization of silicon wafer solar cells can lead to substantial reductions in material costs associated with cell production. A promising approach is the use of multi-wire design. This technology uses many wires in the place of busbars, and the copper wires are “soldered” during the low-temperature lamination process to the fingers (printed or plated) or to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer, e.g. in the case of the a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction cells. Here we describe a solar cell design in which wires are attached to TCO layers using transparent conductive polymer (TCP) films. To this end, we have synthesized a number of thermoplastics, poly(arylene ether ketone) copolymers (co-PAEKs), containing phthalide in their main chain. The fraction of phthalide-containing units in the copolymers was p=3, 5, 15, and 50mol%. With increasing p, the peak strain temperature of the co-PAEKs rises from 205 to 290°C and their optical band gap and refractive index increase from 3.12 to 3.15eV and from 1.6 to 1.614, respectively. The copolymers have a negligible absorption coefficient in the wavelength range 400–1100nm. When exposed to an excess pressure of 1atm or above, co-PAEK films less than 30µm in thickness undergo a transition from a dielectric to a conductive state. The resistivity (ρС) of wire/TCP/TCO (ITO=In2O3:Sn and IFO=In2O3:F) contacts ranges from 0.37 to 1.43mΩcm2. The polymer with the highest phthalide content (p=50mol%) has the lowest ρС. The average work of adhesion per unit area determined by pulling off the wires from the polymer surface depends on both the phthalide content of the co-PAEKs and their reduced viscosity, ranging from 14.3 to 43.5N/cm. The highest value was obtained for the co-PAEK with p=50mol%. We have fabricated low-concentration bifacial IFO/(n+pp+)Cz-Si/ITO solar cells with a wire contact grid attached to IFO and ITO using a co-PAEK film. The efficiency of the best cell under 1× to 7× front/rear illumination was determined to be 18.3–18.9%/15.0–15.6%.

Abstract: Polyamines protect protein glycation in cells against the advanced glycation end product precursor methylglyoxal, which is inevitably produced during glycolysis, and the enzymes that detoxify this α-ketoaldehyde have been widely studied. Nonetheless, nonenzymatic methylglyoxal-scavenging molecules have not been sufficiently studied either in vitro or in vivo. Here, we hypothesized reciprocal regulation between polyamines and methylglyoxal modeled in Dictyostelium grown in a high-glucose medium. We based our hypothesis on the reaction between putrescine and methylglyoxal in putrescine-deficient (odc−) or putrescine-overexpressing (odcoe) cells. In these strains, growth and cell cycle were found to be dependent on cellular methylglyoxal and putrescine contents. The odc− cells showed growth defects and underwent G1 phase cell cycle arrest, which was efficiently reversed by exogenous putrescine. Cellular methylglyoxal, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione levels were remarkably changed in odcoe cells and odc̄ cells. These results revealed that putrescine may act as an intracellular scavenger of methylglyoxal and ROS. Herein, we observed interactions of putrescine and methylglyoxal via formation of a Schiff base complex, by UV–vis spectroscopy, and confirmed this adduct by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry via electrospray ionization. Schiff bases were isolated, analyzed, and predicted to have molecular masses ranging from 124 to 130. We showed that cellular putrescine–methylglyoxal Schiff bases were downregulated in proportion to the levels of endogenous or exogenous putrescine and glutathione in the odc mutants. The putrescine–methylglyoxal Schiff base affected endogenous metabolite levels. This is the first report showing that cellular methylglyoxal functions as a signaling molecule through reciprocal interactions with polyamines by forming Schiff bases.

Abstract: Conventional figures of merit often characterize the optical and electrical properties of transparent conductive thin films and are widely applied in research and industry. However, an appropriative figure is necessary to evaluate the front electrodes of solar cells. So an appropriate figure of merit is therefore proposed in this paper, specifically designed for the evaluation of the front electrodes of solar cells. The proposed figure is adapted from ΦTC, the most commonly used conventional figure of merit, with two changes. First, external quantum efficiency functions for different types of solar cells are explicitly considered. Second, data from the air mass 1.5 spectrum are used as weight factors to calculate the mean optical transmittance. With these two changes, the proposed figure of merit is shown to be well adapted to the photovoltaic field. To validate it, silicon heterojunction solar cells with different front electrodes were simulated as examples. By comparing the simulation results and the respective values of the proposed figure, it is evident that this figure of merit provides values that are proportional to the conversion efficiencies of solar cells. The proposed figure can therefore be used in the selection and manufacturing of front electrodes of solar cells. In addition, two variations on this figure of merit are proposed, specifically adapted to the characteristics of multiple electron-hole pairs cells and thermophotovoltaic cells.

Abstract: The increasing interest in thin flexible and bendable devices has led to a strong demand for mechanically robust and electrically reliable transparent electrodes. Indium doped Tin Oxide (ITO) and Aluminium doped Zinc Oxide (AZO) are among the most employed transparent conductive oxides (TCO) and their reliability on flexible substrates have thus received a great attention. However, a high flexibility is usually achieved at very low thickness, which, unfortunately, compromises the electrical conductivity. Here we report the effects of mechanical bending cycles on the electrical and optical properties of ultra thin AZO/Ag/AZO multilayers (45nm/10nm/45nm) and, for comparison, of AZO and ITO single layers whose thickness was, in both cases, 100nm and 700nm, deposited at room-temperature on flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) plastic substrates. The electrical stability of the films after several cycles of bending were evaluated by monitoring the relative variation of the electrical resistance with respect to the as prepared sample; the structural damage induced by bending was detected by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). We observed an excellent electrical stability and high flexibility in the AZO/Ag/AZO sample even after 100 cycles, whereas for the single AZO and ITO films the resistivity rapidly increases. The experimental results and numerical simulations provide clear evidences of the key role played by the ductile Ag interlayer that provides improved robustness under mechanical strain.

Abstract: Comprehensive studies were carried out to explore the roles of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) thin films in inverted-type CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) based photovoltaics, including the surface morphologies, transmittance spectra, photoluminescence spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Raman scattering spectra and thin-film residual stress analysis. The reduction in the photoluminescence line width indicates that the crystallinity of the MAPbI3 thin film can be increased by covering it with the PCBM thin film. The XRD patterns and Raman scattering spectra show a reduction in the compressive stress of MAPbI3 thin film when covered by the PCBM thin film. In addition, it is noted that the residual stress at the contact interface between the hydrophilic MAPbI3 and the hydrophobic PCBM can be ignored as confirmed by the results obtained with a home-made Twyman-Green interferometer. Consequently, the superior optoelectronic properties of the perovskite materials, as well as the use of a multifunctional fullerene-based thin film as the capping layer allow for the high-efficiency perovskite photovoltaics.

Abstract: The photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells is extremely dependent on the crystallization and morphology of the perovskite film, which are affected by the deposition method. Here, we demonstrate a simple approach to form a microporous PbI2 film, with subsequent conversion to a compact, highly crystalline perovskite film. The PbI2 and corresponding perovskite films were further probed by two-dimensional X-ray diffraction. The resultant perovskite exhibited improved photovoltaic performance under ambient conditions with about 50% humidity. The PbI2 microporous structure was formed by exchanging residual DMSO with DMF vapor in the PbI2 film, which facilitated contact with the methylammonium iodide (MAI) solution. The process resulted in the formation of compact, smooth, pinhole-free perovskite films having no residual PbI2. Solar cells fabricated using this methodology exhibited power conversion efficiencies over 16% with negligible photocurrent hysteresis.

Abstract: Solar cells based on conjugated polymer and fullerene blends exhibit morphology-dependent stability towards ionizing radiation exposure. Blend thin film solar cells of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were irradiated up to 1Mrad with X-rays (10–60KeV) and investigated with resonance Raman and photocurrent/photovoltage modulation spectroscopy and imaging. Bulk blend morphological characteristics were pre-selected by controlling film processing conditions (i.e., solvent and thermal annealing). As-cast P3HT/PCBM devices with a large fraction of a well-mixed phase display improvements in performance upon application of post-irradiation annealing treatments. On the other hand, devices annealed prior to irradiation showed irreversible performance degradation that could not be recovered following annealing treatments after exposure. Resonance Raman spectroscopy and imaging following irradiation up to 1Mrad reveals virtually no changes in the P3HT structural and packing integrity for both types of devices. Intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy measurements indicate that radiation-induced performance degradation is concentrated in the vicinity of device contacts, evident from large alterations in charge extraction kinetics. We propose that charge transfer from the aluminum cathode leads to formation of a space charge zone which becomes more pronounced in devices with greater phase purification (i.e., larger PCBM crystallites in the vicinity of the cathode). Importantly, well-mixed P3HT/PCBM regions, which are more plentiful in as-cast devices, appear to mitigate radiation-induced performance degradation since application of post-irradiation annealing treatments restores device performances to pristine levels. Our results suggest that greater morphological stability, such as polymer/fullerene systems forming co-crystals, is key for suppressing performance losses from ionizing radiation exposure.

Abstract: Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with photoanodes composed of chirality selected single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been fabricated and tested for first time. Single chirality SWCNTs separation (93% purity) have been achieved by modifying standard size exclusion gel chromatography. Chirality selection has allowed for “tuning” of the energy barrier at the TiO2/SWNT/FTO interface, electronic conductivity enhancement, and reduced SWCNTs-ruthenium dye competition for light absorption resulting in a 81% energy conversion efficiency improvement compared to mixed chirality cells. Unfortunately, energy conversion efficiency has been limited by cells’ low shunt resistance. Additionally, SWCNTs electron transfer properties have been exploited to prepare mixed and chirality specific CNTs based DSSCs’ counter electrodes.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by aberrant deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents, including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), that may play a role in remodelling processes by influencing critical mediators such as growth factors. We hypothesize that GAGs may be altered in IPF and that this contribute to create a pro-fibrotic environment. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the fine structure of heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) and hyaluronan (HA) in lung samples from IPF patients and from control subjects. GAGs in lung samples from severe IPF patients and donor lungs were analyzed with HPLC. HS was assessed by immunohistochemistry and collagen was quantified as hydroxyproline content. The total amount of HS, CS/DS and HA was increased in IPF lungs but there was no significant difference in the total collagen content. We found a relative increase in total sulfation of HS due to increment of 2-O, 6-O and N-sulfation and a higher proportion of sulfation in CS/DS. Highly sulfated HS was located in the border zone between denser areas and more normal looking alveolar parenchyma in basement membranes of blood vessels and airways, that were immuno-positive for perlecan, as well as on the cell surface of spindle-shaped cells in the alveolar interstitium. These findings show for the first time that both the amount and structure of glycosaminoglycans are altered in IPF. These changes may contribute to the tissue remodelling in IPF by altering growth factor retention and activity, creating a pro-fibrotic ECM landscape.

Abstract: Poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride)(SMA)-graft-polyethylene glycol)(PEG) copolymers were synthesized as novel polymeric solid–solid phase change materials (S-SPCMs). The synthesized copolymers showed latent heat storage and release ability by means of the phase transition from crystalline phase to amorphous phase of PEG bonded to the skeleton as side chains. The chemical structures of the polymeric S-SPCMs were confirmed by fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) analysis techniques. The transformation of crystalline phase to amorphous phase were investigated using and polarized optical microscopy (POM) techniques. The latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) of the S-SPCMs were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis method. Thermal degradation temperature limits of the S-SPCMs were determined by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) method. The DSC analysis indicated that the synthesized S-SPCMs demonstrated typical solid-solid phase transitions in the temperature range of about 40–45°C and had considerable high latent heat capacity between 107 and 155Jg−1. The TGA results showed that the polymeric S-SPCMs were durable thermally up to at least 300°C. The thermal cycling test exposed that the S-SPCMs protected their LHTES properties even after 5000 heating/cooling treatment.

Abstract: High quality CH3NH3PbI3 films have been successfully constructed by two-step method, using the PbI2 solution after dissolution-crystallization-dissolution treatment. Depending on the dense perovskite thin film morphology, a best and repeatable power conversion efficiency of 14.87% was achieved from the CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells. Furtherly, excellent device stability was also exhibited, which was remained at more than 77% efficiency under 50% humidity for 10 days.

Abstract: A significant energy loss results from the poor thermal insulations of the commercial and public buildings. Windows diffuse a large fraction of building heating and cooling energy to the external environment, representing an annual impact of 4.1 quadrillion British thermal unit of primary energy in the US. The current technology for efficient windows relies upon the double-pane insulated glass unit with an insulating gas in between. A key challenge is to reduce thermal conductivity of the windows without relying on insulating materials. The photothermal effect can be possibly utilized for particular functionalities that can collect solar energy for reducing heat loss. The insulation efficiency is quantified through the U-factor, defined as the ratio of the heat flux (H) per unit area through the pane to the difference (ΔT) between the window interior surface and exterior temperatures. Upon solar irradiation, single-panes can “self-heat” via the photothermal effect from the nanoparticle coatings. This can effectively reduce ΔT for enhanced thermal insulation. In this study, the photothermal effect on Fe3O4 nanoparticles stimulated by solar light was investigated for nanoparticles in solutions and as thin films for energy–efficient windows. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles were surface-functionalized with different polymers to modulate colloidal stability and for the investigation of the photothermal effect. The photothermal heating efficiencies of Fe3O4 with different surface coatings were found to be much greater under the white-light irradiation than near infrared (NIR) in both aqueous suspension and as thin films. The mechanism for the photothermal effect of Fe3O4 was identified in terms of its band structure. Both Urbach energy and band gap were obtained based on absorption spectra of various Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The Urbach “tail” was found consistent with nanoparticle surface defect structures, while the band gap (~3.1eV) corresponded to the electronic transitions in the octahedral site of Fe3O4. We also discuss the absorption-based photonic physics responsible for the much-enhanced photothermal heating by white-light as compared with NIR. Based on the photothermal heating, the U-factors were obtained with the nanoparticle coatings that show promise in producing energy efficient windows.

Abstract: Understanding the charge carrier dynamics and charge transport in metal halide perovskites and their correlation with the synthesis procedure is crucial for the fabrication of competitive thin film photovoltaic devices and their further improvement. In this work we investigate two CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) films both deposited by a two-step protocol and only differing in the optional addition of a chloride containing salt to the precursor solution. Although being highly akin from a chemical and structural point of view, these films show substantial differences in their optoelectronic characteristics. For chloride-treated perovskite films we find an enhanced average power conversion efficiency of 10.3% and charge carrier mobility of μ=2.16cm2/Vs in comparison to 5.3% and μ=1.62cm2/Vs for untreated MAPI films, respectively. Moreover, we observe different light-soaking behavior and increased photoluminescence lifetimes of 70ns in the case of chloride-treated MAPI and 100ns for pure MAPI. From in-situ photoluminescence lifetime measurements during the crystallization process we conclude that the chloride addition during film deposition results in slower crystal growth, leading to fewer defects and higher crystalline order.

Abstract: We report on direct evidence of Cd doping of the CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) surface in physical vapor deposited (PVD) CdS/CIGS heterojunctions by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and related techniques. We find Cd doping of the CIGS near-surface region regardless of the presence or absence of Cu rich domains in the CdS for both zinc-blende (zb) and wurtzite (wz) CdS. However, we find that the Cd penetrates much farther into the CIGS when Cu-rich domains are present in the CdS. This suggests that Cu exchanges with Cd, increasing the concentration gradient for Cd in the CIGS and thus driving Cd into the CIGS surface. The Cd doping is clearly resolved at atomic resolution in aberration-corrected STEM-high angle annular dark field images. In zb-CdS/CIGS heterojunctions, Cd is shown to substitute for both Cu and Ga atoms, while in wz-CdS/CIGS heterojunctions Cd seems to predominantly occupy Cu sites. Cd doping in the CIGS surface layer suggests the formation of a p-n homojunction in the CIGS, which may account for the high device efficiencies, comparable to CBD-CdS/CIGS processed structures.

Abstract: As Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) development matures, the demand grows for rapid characterisation of degradation and application of Quantitative Accelerated Life Tests (QALT) models to predict and improve reliability. To date, most accelerated testing on OPVs has been conducted using ISOS consensus standards. This paper identifies some of the problems in using and interpreting the results for predicting ageing based upon ISOS consensus standard test data. Design of Experiments (DOE) in conjunction with data from ISOS consensus standards are used as the basis for developing life test models for OPV modules. This is used to study their temperature-humidity and light-induced degradation, which enables failure rates during accelerated testing to be assessed against the typical outdoor operational conditions. The life test models are used to assess the relative severity of the ISOS standards and the impact of geographic and seasonal climatic changes on OPV degradation.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared in a one-step microwave-assisted synthesis using a mixture of trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and oleylamine (OLA) as solvent. The reaction medium was optimized by varying the TOPO and OLA ratios to control the CZTS NPs formation. The synthesized CZTS NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. High quality CZTS NPs with composition of Cu1.8Zn1.4SnS3.6, optimum size distribution in the range of 22±4nm and band gap of around 1.5eV were obtained using microwave assisted synthesis method with OLA:TOPO (1:1) as co-solvent. In the microwave assisted process, the reaction temperature and time has been reduced significantly to 165°C and 10min respectively, as compared with other wet chemical solvothermal hot injection/ surfactant based methods. Finally, CZTSSe solar cell fabricated from the selenized microwave-assisted CZTS NPs yielded an efficiency of 4.48%; therefore, the low cost of synthesis of this high quality CZTS NPs ink and the capability of spraying for large solar cell area is very attractive.

Abstract: Control of microstructural evolution during the crystallization of InSe thin films is an inevitable strategy to mold their fundamental properties and potential for the fabrication of solar cells. Impact of annealing as well as substrate temperature on the crystallization progress and physical characteristics of thermally evaporated InSe was examined systematically, which eventually dictates the overall performance of resulting device. Structural and compositional characterizations have been thoroughly investigated by X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray analyses. InSe films form hexagonal structure with a preferred orientation of crystallites along the (004) direction upon crystallization. The layer of InSe is formed by two concomitant processes, deposition and recrystallization. Application of heat treatment resulted in topographical modification, which was probed by an atomic force microscope. Surface roughness was enhanced due to the influence of temperature and thereby the growth of grains. Investigations of electrical and optical properties, thus provided ample evidence for the use of crystallized monophase InSe as an absorber layer in photovoltaic conversion devices. Carrier concentration and mobility of charge carriers estimated from the Hall measurements were found to be 19.43×1020cm−3 and 2.01cm2V−1s−1 respectively. Moreover, this research work explores power conversion efficiency of p-InSe/n-CdS heterojunction solar cells.

Abstract: CuSbSe2 has attracted huge attention as an absorber material for thin-film solar cells due to its attractive optical and electrical properties, as well as earth-abundant, low-cost, and low-toxic constituent elements. However, different from the conventional inorganic absorbers such as CdTe, CuSbSe2 has a complicated phase space with at least five competitive phases such as Cu2Se, CuSe, Sb2Se3, Cu3SbSe4, and Cu3SbSe3 and crystallizes in two-dimension (2D) layered structure. Crystal phase and orientation strongly correlate with film properties and thus are crucial for device performance. In this paper, by varying the annealing temperature, we carefully investigated the phase, electrical properties and crystal orientation evolutions of hydrazine solution processed CuSbSe2 films. Intermediate Cu3SbSe3 secondary phase was identified, and the temperature dependent orientation change was observed, which is driven by the reduced surface energy, as supported by the first-principle calculations. Finally, a prototype thin film solar cell is fabricated, achieving 2.70% efficiency. Our theoretical calculation and experimental investigation demonstrated the importance of controlling phase composition and crystal orientation in the application for photovoltaics.

Abstract: This work presents a method to extract the spatial distributions of local two-diode parameters, contact resistance, grid resistance, and emitter resistance of a solar cell, based on spatial data obtained by lock-in thermography, 4-point probing, electroluminescence, and photoluminescence imaging. The extracted parameters are input into Griddler, a finite-element simulator, to calculate the cell plane voltage distributions as a test of the goodness of fit. This Griddler model then can be used to predict the cell properties under conditions not measured before, e.g. at different temperatures, biasing, and illumination conditions, and it can be used to evaluate the influence of certain defects on the cell efficiency by excluding them in the simulation.

Abstract: Electronic skins and smart textiles are emerging applications integrating wearable displays, smart sensing systems, health-care monitors, and stretchable power systems. Although various deformable optoelectronic devices have been demonstrated, high-performance stretchable photovoltaic (PV) devices remain a significant challenge in device engineering and materials optimization. In this paper, we demonstrate how a ubiquitous material—3M™ tape—can be used as a transparent substrate for highly efficient stretchable organic PV devices. Indeed, we constructed a stretchable OPV device displaying a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.2% (under AM 1.5G 1000Wm−2)—the highest reported to date; in addition, this device retained 80% of its original PCE after 50 cycles of stretching at 20% strain. This study paves the way toward fully deformable OPVs for integration in wearable electronics.

Abstract: In this work, p-type NiO thin film was applied as a buffer layer in the back contact for CdTe thin film solar cell fabrication. The NiO layers were prepared by electron beam evaporation. By optimizing NiO layer thickness in the back contact a CdTe solar cell with an efficiency of 12.17% and an open-circuit voltage Voc of 790mV has been fabricated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study showed that NiO has a staggered band alignment with CdTe. Such an electronic band structure alignment allows smooth hole transport from CdTe to NiO and at the same time NiO acts as a surface field layer to reduce electron recombination at the back contact interface, thus leading to improved Voc. This study also demonstrates that by employing NiO as a buffer layer, much less Cu was needed for the CdTe solar cell fabrication and the cell device stability had been significantly enhanced compared to the CdTe solar cell with a conventional Cu/Au bimetal layer as the back contact.

Abstract: Hexim-1 is an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II transcription elongation. Decreased Hexim-1 expression in animal models of chronic diseases such as left ventricular hypertrophy, obesity and cancer triggered significant changes in adaptation and remodeling. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the role of Hexim1 in lipid metabolism focused in the progression of atherosclerosis and steatosis. We used the C57BL6 apolipoprotein E (ApoE null) crossed bred to C57BL6Hexim1 heterozygous mice to obtain ApoE null − Hexim1 heterozygous mice (ApoE-HT). Both ApoE null backgrounds were fed high fat diet for twelve weeks. Then, we evaluated lipid metabolism, atherosclerotic plaque formation and liver steatosis. In order to understand changes in the transcriptome of both backgrounds during the progression of steatosis, we performed Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 microarray. After 12 weeks of HFD, ApoE null and ApoE-HT showed similar increase of cholesterol and triglycerides in plasma. Plaque composition was altered in ApoE-HT. Additionally, liver triglycerides and steatosis were decreased in ApoE-HT mice. Affymetrix analysis revealed that decreased steatosis might be due to impaired inducible SOCS3 expression in ApoE-HT mice. In conclusion, decreased Hexim-1 expression does not alter cholesterol metabolism in ApoE null background after HFD. However, it promotes stable atherosclerotic plaque and decreased steatosis by promoting the anti-inflammatory TGFβ pathway and blocking the expression of the inducible and pro-inflammatory expression of SOCS3 respectively.

Abstract: Gremlin-1, a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist, has essential roles in kidney and limb bone development, and is important in chronic diseases including tissue fibrosis. It also functions as an activating ligand of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and binds strongly to the sulfated polysaccharide, heparin. Here we investigated the extent to which gremlin binds to the related polysaccharide heparan sulfate (HS), which unlike heparin is widely distributed spread within tissues. We determined that both highly sulfated HS and kidney HS are able to partially compete for the binding of heparin to gremlin, whereas low sulfated HS is a poor competitor. In further investigations of the interaction between gremlin and HS, we found that wild-type gremlin is able to bind broadly across the various regions of kidney in an HS-dependent manner, with particularly intense binding to tubular structures in the renal cortex. In a model of chronic kidney disease, fibrotic changes in the kidney result in a loss of gremlin binding sites. Gremlin mutants with reduced affinity for heparin showed negligible binding under the same conditions. These mutants nonetheless remain functional as BMP antagonists on C2C12 myoblastic cells transfected with a Smad 1 reporter gene construct. Overall our findings indicate that on secretion, gremlin will bind to HS structures on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, thus providing for a localised reservoir which can modulate BMP activity in a temporospatially restricted manner. Although binding of heparin/HS to gremlin has been shown elsewhere to be necessary for gremlin activation of VEGFR2, this does not appear to be essential for BMP antagonism by gremlin. Thus these sulfated polysaccharides differentially regulate the activities of gremlin.

Abstract: The overall efficiencies of screen printed monocrystalline Si solar cells are limited by electrical losses across the Si-metallization interface. The process of metallization affects the emitter and space charge region of the solar cell, particularly with respect to the dopant distributions. Until now, direct imaging of dopant distributions across the interface has not been reported mainly because the concentrations of dopants are far below the detection limit of conventional analytical tools. In the present study, we harness the high-resolution (100nm) high-sensitivity chemical imaging with Nano Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and correlate with microstructural and electrical properties to elucidate the factors limiting the overall cell efficiencies. We analysed two sets of p-type solar cells fabricated from identical starting materials, the only difference being the firing temperature. It was found that the overall efficiency of cells fired at 900°C was ∼17% while the efficiency of cells fired at 960°C was only 13.6%. In phosphorus (P) ion maps, the P emitter structure was found to be well-preserved by NanoSIMS in cells fired at 900°C, it was completely disintegrated in the overfired cells and thereby increasing the contact resistance. The passivation layer (SiNX) was found to be disintegrated in the overfired cell and furthermore, below the metallization, a diffusion cloud was observed wherein boron (B) rich domains extend over several µm. In the overfired cell the disintegration of the SiNX layer identified in the SEM correlated with the disintegrated emitter structure (P) analysed by NanoSIMS. This implies that the disintegration of the passivation layer leads to a diffusion of the dopants resulting in the loss of overall cell efficiency. Thus, our new comprehensive approach provides unprecedented insights into the factors limiting the overall efficiencies in solar cells.

Abstract: Solar-absorbing multilayers with β-FeSi2-containing SiO2 composites were deposited on low-emissivity Mo base layers, and the optical reflectance spectra were obtained to investigate the solar–thermal conversion efficiency. Interband absorption of the β-FeSi2 provided a desirable selective absorbing behaviour with a steep transition curve from high solar absorption to low infrared absorption in the near-infrared region. The β-FeSi2 nanoparticles dispersed in the SiO2 matrices were stable even after annealing at 750°C, and the optical constant spectra of the composite films were controllable by adjusting the β-FeSi2 content. Although the interface between the β-FeSi2 and Mo base layer had low thermal stability because of the diffusion of Si, a thin SiO2 barrier at the interlayer was effective in suppressing the interaction. The above findings were integrated into the designed multilayer “SiO2/β-FeSi2+SiO2 composites/SiO2 barrier/Mo base”, for which the optical absorption spectrum achieved high conversion efficiencies of over 72.3% at high temperatures below 700°C.

Abstract: The nickel-phosphate decorated phosphate-Fe2O3 photoanode (NiPi/Pi-Fe2O3) was fabricated by coating phosphate modified hematite (Pi-Fe2O3) with naturally abundant nickel-phosphate complexes (NiPi). X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy studies showed that NiPi was uniformly distributed on Pi-Fe2O3 surface as amorphous form. With the decoration of NiPi, the photocurrent of Pi-Fe2O3 was enhanced by ca. 2 times at 1.5V (vs. RHE). The NiPi/Pi-Fe2O3 also exhibited higher maximum power generation in photoelectrochemical (PEC) glycerol-based fuel cell, which was ca. 2.4 times than that of Pi-Fe2O3. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed the charge transfer resistance at the interface of Pi-Fe2O3/electrolyte was remarkably decreased by NiPi decoration. NiPi was believed to be not only a hole-conductor that promoting the charge separation but also a catalyst for glycerol oxidation through cyclic changes between the lower and the higher oxidation states of Ni, which were the main reasons for the enhanced PEC response and power generation. The intermediates from glycerol were verified using high performance liquid chromatography, indicating the efficient cleavage of C-C bonds in glycerol on NiPi/Pi-Fe2O3. This work demonstrates NiPi/Pi-Fe2O3 has great potential in PEC fuel cells for the generation of electricity from light energy and biomass energy.

Abstract: YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) transcriptional coactivator is a downstream gene of the Hippo signaling pathway, which controls cell proliferation and differentiation. YAP1 plays a significant role in the regulation of cartilage and bone development. However, the molecular mechanism by which YAP1 regulates chondrocyte differentiation remains to be elucidated. Immunofluorescent staining was used to visualize the localization of YAP1 expression in the mouse chondroprogenitor ATDC5 cell line. ATDC5 cells with lentivirus-vector-mediated YAP1 overexpression and knockdown were established. The differentiation abilities were examined by real-time quantitative PCR and two staining methods The expression levels of sex-determining region Y-type high mobility group box protein (SOX9) and key proteins in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway were analyzed by Western blot. The Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) of β-catenin were used for further study. The YAP1 protein was mainly expressed in the nucleus of ATDC5 cells. YAP1 overexpression enhanced chondrocyte proliferation but inhibited chondrocyte differentiation, which were contrary to the findings of the YAP1-knockdown group. Moreover, YAP1 overexpression activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Treatment with exogenous DKK1 and β-catenin siRNA partially recaptured the effects of YAP1 overexpression on ATDC5 cell differentiation. Taken together, our study suggested that YAP1 attenuated ATDC5 cell chondrogenic and hypertrophic differentiation. We also demonstrated that YAP1 exerted its effect on the chondrocyte differentiation by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Abstract: PbS colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaic solar cells material. The synthesis of PbS QDs generally uses TMS2S as sulfur source. However, the volatile and environmentally unfriendly properties of TMS2S will limit its industrial applications. This paper presents a new method of synthesizing PbS QDs employing a CdS QDs/ODE solution as the sulfur precursor by exploiting a cation exchange reaction. The resulting QDs show a performance comparable with previous work for solar cells. Through optimizing the architecture of the photoactive layer, excellent stability in air is achieved. An efficiency of 7.89% is retained in air after 110 days.

Abstract: In this article, we present an in-depth study of the internal physical processes of carriers in a GaInP solar cell under forward bias by investigating the electroluminescence (EL) signature. Overall, it is found that the device shows nonlinear EL dependence on the injection current and hence the carrier concentration at all the examined temperatures. At low temperatures, the EL spectra are featured by an asymmetric luminescence band with low energy tail, showing that the electrically injected carriers always prefer to occupy the local extended states with lower potential energies first. As the injection current and hence carrier density increases, two physical effects become apparent: state filling and carrier transfer. The former results in a significant Burstein-Moss shift of the first EL band, while the latter leads to the second luminescence band with higher energy, being an optical evidence of existence of the Mott mobility edge. With the aid of localized-state ensemble (LSE) luminescence model, we can quantitatively describe the effects of injection current on the state filling and transfer of carriers in terms of a Fermi-level-like energy level. Furthermore, the spectral data analysis indicates that self-absorption of the emitted photons could be an important process in the solar cell.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the electrical, structural, and optical properties of band gap front-graded Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin films grown by a modified single-step sulfo-selenization process from copper-poor and zinc-rich precursor metallic stacks prepared by co-evaporation. To investigate how the bandgap was graded in connection with the compositional distribution, we calculated the bandgap energy distribution along the film thickness, based on the transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy composition profile. The band gap of the CZTSSe phase with high S content near the surface layer is determined to be 1.161eV. From the surface to the bottom, there is a decrease in the S content of the CZTSSe phase, and the band gap subsequently decreases to, 1.029eV, close to the value of CZTSe. From the results of dimpling-Raman and scanning transmission electron microscopy line scanning, we confirm that the S content drastically increases from the bottom to the top surface of the CZTSSe thin film. The CZTSSe thin-film solar cell exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.33%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.505 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 31.61mA/cm2, fill factor (FF) of 64.6%, and Voc deficit of 525mV. Compared with the performance of the CZTSe solar cell, which had PCE of 7.23%, Voc of 0.424 V, Jsc of 32.83mAcm−2, FF of 51.9%, and Voc deficit of 576mV, the Voc and Voc deficit of the CZTSSe cell improved considerably. The high Voc, low Voc deficit, and less loss of Jsc are attributed to the effect of band gap front-grading induced by S grading into the CZTSSe thin film.

Abstract: In this work, bentonite–based composite phase change materials (CPCMs) were fabricated by the impregnation of fatty acid eutectics into bentonite clay. In the composites, the palmitic acid (PA)–stearic acid (SA) eutectics mixtures were undertook as phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage, and the bentonite were performed as the supporting material. Expanded graphite (EG) was employed for helping restrain the eutectic mixtures from leakage as well as improving thermal conductivity of the CPCMs. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was adopted to assess the thermal properties of the composites, the results showed that the CPCMs have suitable melting temperature of around 54°C with latent heat capacity of 89.12–163.72kJ/kg. Fourier transformation infrared (FT–IR) and X–ray diffractometer (XRD) were utilized to test the chemical structure and crystalline phase of the CPCMs. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed that the organic PCMs homogenously spread to the surface and interior of the bentonite. The thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA) detected that the CPCMs were provided with good thermal stability. As the content of the EG increased, the leakage of the PA–SA eutectics reduced considerably. The results from the thermal conductivity meter (TCM) showed that the thermal conductivity of the CPCM with content of 5% EG reached to 1.51W/(mK) in liquid state and 1.66W/(mK) in solid state, which was nearly 5.6 times and 4.9 times higher than that of the CPCM without the EG. Experiments displayed that the thermal storage and release rates were noticeably enhanced by combining the EG into original CPCMs. The CPCMs maintained thermal properties after 50 heating–cooling cycling. It is envisioned that the satisfactory CPCMs maintain considerable prospects in thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Recent developments have unlocked the main issues arising from the combination of III-V and silicon and have opened a new way to fabricate tandem solar cells. In this study we provide a detailed analysis of III-V/epi-SiGe tandem devices performance using opto-electrical models and parameters acquired from previous experimental realizations of single junction devices. At first, we present the validation of our top and bottom cells models by comparison with previously published solar cells. The analysis of the current matching and the impact of the Al content in AlGaAs absorber on the open circuit voltage is performed on a very wide range of thickness and Al content. The optimal configurations for tandems with thin film absorbers are found with an empirical expression. This expression relates the required bottom absorber thickness to the Al content for current matching in a flat tandem device. Low-temperature epitaxial SiGe growth on III-V materials is an inverted growth technique, meaning that the last material grown is the Si(Ge) bottom cell. We can thus easily texture the back of the bottom cell for higher photon absorption. The proposed nanostructurization of the back reflector shows that, to reach the same efficiency, only half of the thickness is required if a 2D grating is combined with a silver reflector. The detailed influence of the bulk and interface electrical quality in the epi-SiGe bottom cell is also assessed. Finally, the prediction of the tandem device performance according to different realistic scenarios is presented.

Abstract: This work reports on the development of CdTe thin film solar cells grown on ZnO nanowire arrays. The focus was placed on utilising ZnO nanowire arrays as a replacement to the conventional ZnO thin film buffer layer, thereby requiring minimal alteration to the existing solar cell structure. Incorporation of nanowires was found to alter subsequent film growth and processing, with the nanowire dimensions changing device performance significantly. Shorter, ~100nm, wires were found to produce particularly low device performance of <0.5% whilst longer wires in the range 250–2000nm were able to produce more functional cells. Working devices of up to 9.5% efficiency were achieved through the production of “embedded tip” nanowire solar cells. Variation of the nanowires length demonstrated that the nanowires were involved in carrier recombination and that this may be the performance limiting factor.

Abstract: Advancements in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) technology are occurring at an ever-increasing rate, as the development of novel carbon-based materials, the increasing research into new 3D surface morphologies and cell design, and the focus on the development of new sensitizers and electrolytes have allowed many new possibilities for DSSCs. Solar cells that are three-dimensionally structured offer significant advantages over traditional crystalline / semi-crystalline panels in that they can convert incident photons that strike them at large incident angles, can be flexible / used in applications which require non-rigid materials, and can be substantially cheaper to produce than traditional panels, especially with the replacement of more expensive, traditional electrode materials by carbon materials in the working / counter electrode. The use of carefully selected and engineered sensitizers like quantum dots with these three-dimensionally structured solar cells have seen them achieve ever-increasing power conversion efficiencies, and it's likely that they will soon rival traditional crystalline / semi-crystalline panels for both mass power generation and use in more niche applications such as flexible photovoltaic textile fibers. This review covers DSSCs constructed with several different materials, and the advantages and disadvantages of a variety of cell designs.

Abstract: This work is a continuation of earlier work where TiC/Al2O3 spectrally selective solar absorbers were deposited onto stainless steel (SS). In this study, the optical simulation, corrosion behavior and long term thermal stability are investigated in detail. A series of TiC and Al2O3 single layers are fabricated by magnetron sputtering using the same deposition parameters as described in the previous work. The optical constants and thicknesses of glass, stainless steel, TiC and Al2O3 layers are obtained by CODE software using the suitable dielectric function model. Then, the structure model of SS/TiC/Al2O3 is constructed and the reflectance spectra of the SS/TiC/Al2O3 solar absorber is successfully simulated using CODE software. The anti-corrosion performance of SS/TiC/Al2O3 solar absorbers is evaluated through electrochemical potentiodynamic polarization measurement and salt spray test. The SS/TiC/Al2O3 solar absorbers have a good thermal stability in vacuum at 500°C for 100h. Raman analysis indicates that the increased sp2 bonds of the coating is the main reason for the degradation of the optical properties.

Abstract: (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)Se2 thin films deposited by a three-stage co-evaporation process have shown potential as mid- and wide-bandgap absorber materials for solar cell devices. Further growth optimization requires a thorough understanding of secondary phases formed in addition to the primary chalcopyrite phase, during the group-I rich growth near the end of the second stage. In this study, we investigate how the composition ratio Ag/(Ag+Cu) controls the formation of the secondary phases containing Ag, Cu and Se. Group-I rich [composition ratio (Ag+Cu)/(In+Ga)>1] ACIGS films with varying silver content—Ag/(Ag+Cu)=0, 0.1 and 0.5—are grown until the end of the second stage of three-stage processes. Secondary phases are found to locate near film surfaces. However, they intermix with the chalcopyrite phase in the surface layer when Ag/(Ag+Cu)>0, while they form a separate layer if no Ag is alloyed. The crystal structures of the secondary phases shifts along the Cu2Se - Ag2Se pseudo-binary tie-line as Ag/(Ag+Cu) increases. Concurrently, the film surfaces become smoother with reduced facets and voids, the accumulation of sodium is suppressed, and both the degree of In and Ga gradient and the film emissivity are reduced, all of which affect the subsequent deposition process and final solar device performance.

Abstract: To improve the energy utilization efficiency of solar energy, Ti4O7/PEG/SiO2 form-stable phase change material (PCM) with characters of light-heat conversion and thermal conductivity enhancement was developed by in-situ doping titanium black (Ti4O7) through acid and alkali catalytic sol-gel method. The structure and properties of PCM were investigated by SEM, FT-IR, XRD, DSC, TG, coefficient of thermal conductivity and thermal conversion testing, etc. The results showed that the Ti4O7/PEG/SiO2 could effectively absorb UV–visible light of solar radiation, simultaneously, the light energy was translated into thermal energy which was storied by PCM. Furthermore, the composite PCM exhibited good thermal stability below 360°C, excellent shape-stabilized effect and high thermal conductivity. The Ti4O7/PEG/SiO2 as novel thermal storage material can usefully enhance the utilization efficiency of solar energy.

Abstract: Background
Doxorubicin (DOX) is an anti-tumor agent that is widely used in clinical setting for cancer treatment. The application of the DOX, however, is limited by its cardiac toxicity which can induce heart failure through an undefined mechanism. Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) is a mitochondrial GTPase fusion protein that is located on the outer membrane of mitochondria (OMM). The Mfn2 plays an important role in mitochondrial fusion and fission. The aim of this study is to identify the role of the Mfn2 in DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
Methods
Cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were used in this study. Mfn2 expression in cardiomyocytes was determined after the cardiomyocytes were challenged with DOX. Cardiomyocyte mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed with mitochondrial fragmentation and MitoSOX fluorescence probe, respectively. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was determined with caspase3 activity and TUNEL staining.
Results
Challenging of the cardiomyocytes with DOX resulted in increasing in cardiomyocyte oxidative stress and apoptosis. In addition, levels of Mfn2 in cardiomyocytes were decreased after the cells were challenged with DOX which was associated with increased mitochondrial fission (fragmentation) and mitochondrial ROS production. An increase in cardiomyocyte levels of Mfn2 attenuated the DOX-induced increase in mitochondrial fission and prevented cardiomyocyte mitochondrial ROS production. An increase in cardiomyocyte levels of Mfn2 or pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with an anti-oxidant, Mito-tempo, also prevented the DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that DOX results in a decreased cardiomyocyte Mfn2 expression which promotes mitochondrial fission and ROS production further leads to cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a solvent-free, low temperature (<25–170°C) approach using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grafting and polymerization processes to passivate the unpaired electrons or “dangling” bonds on the surface of silicon. The multifunctional (dielectric and electronically conducting) passivating layers described here achieved several orders of magnitude improvement in minority carrier lifetime (>2ms) compared to bare silicon (~30μs), and remained stable in air for over 200h. These values approach that of SiNx films deposited at significantly higher temperatures. The polymer passivation processes and materials are shown to significantly reduce surface recombination rates: chemically by reducing density of surface states and electrostatically by altering band bending at the silicon interface. Passivation quality also improved on grafting using aliphatic monomers compared to aromatic ones suggesting a reduction in steric effects in the former, helping us posit design rules for polymer based surface passivation of silicon. Finally, the ability to use an electrically conducting polymer for passivation creates a direct interface between traditional silicon microelectronics and organic electronics. Beyond microelectronics and photovoltaics, these processes can enable the fabrication of hybrid or multifunctional devices, such as biosensors and light emitting diodes.

Abstract: Based on well-defined lab conditions, we have developed experimental methods to characterize bifacial laser crystallized multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) thin film solar cells fabricated on glass. Key parameters which determine the performance of the bifacial solar cells such as light intensity and incidence angle dependence on both sides have been characterized. From these parameters and the local irradiance data, the annual power output of the bifacial solar cells can be simulated easily. In addition, bifacial measurements under well-defined conditions using a single sun simulator have been performed by means of a mirror. The best bifacial mc-Si thin film solar cell shows a “bifacial efficiency” of 12.4% compared to state of the art monofacial mc-Si thin film counterpart of 12.1%. According to our simulation, even a “bifacial efficiency” above 14% is realistic if the solar cell is installed in front of a white diffuse scattering surface with a reflectance of ~90%. A threshold of 24% additional light contribution at which the bifacial mc-Si thin film solar cells outperform the monofacial ones have been determined by simulations. This shows that the advantages of the bifacial cells can already be observed at very low level (<25%) of additional reflected light contribution.

Abstract: The modification of metal/metal oxide electrode is of great importance to the performance of inverted organic optoelectronic devices. Cross-linked films provide good chance to modify the metal/metal oxide electrode and enable the fabrication of high-performance multi-layer organic optoelectronic devices due to its superior ability to resist solvent erosion. However, most of the reported methods to prepare cross-linked films are suffering from harsh processing conditions such as high-temperature thermal treatment or long-time UV radiation. Here, we develop novel robust cross-linked thin films which are prepared from an epoxy-functionalized conjugated polymer (PFEX) and an amine-based small molecule (TAA). The cross-linking processing can be realized under mild heating due to the highly-efficient amine-epoxide reaction, and the resulting cross-linked films show good solvent resistibility. Moreover, the cross-linked films showed large tolerance with the composition of PFEX and TAA, which provides opportunity to modify the metal/metal oxide electrodes in a wide range using the cross-linked films. The modified indium tin oxide (ITO) using the cross-linked films show much lowered work function and hydrophobic property than pristine ITO, which indicates great potential application in inverted organic optoelectronic devices. Inverted polymer solar cells (IPSCs) using the modified ITO show remarkable enhanced power conversion efficiency (9.4%) than those with pristine ITO (6.8%). Our design and preparation of the novel cross-linked films and the finding on the correlation between cross-linked film and photovoltaic performance will be useful to design and prepare high-performance cross-linked films for inverted organic optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: In the present work, Ge doped CZTGeS thin films are pulsed laser deposited followed by annealing treatment in selenium environment. The influence of selenization condition on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of the absorber thin films are investigated. The thin films characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy techniques confirm the formation of Kesterite CZTGeSSe thin film compound with dominant A1 mode vibration. The morphological and optical studies of the thin films reveal the formation of compact and void free microstructure with optimal band gap in the range of 1–1.2eV. The impact of selenization temperature on the quality of thin films has been studied and thin film solar cells are fabricated with CZTGeSSe absorbers grown at various annealing temperatures from 525 to 575℃ to evaluate the performance of devices as a function of an annealing temperature. The elemental Ge and Sn losses from the absorber compound confirmed from X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) depended on the annealing temperature and linearly increased with increasing temperature affecting the optical, compositional and microstructural properties of the thin films. Compositional non uniformity is one of the factors that limit the performance of solar cell device. PLD technique due to its advantage of achieving precise stoichiometry control combined with optimized selenization conditions can potentially address the issue. Compared to solar cell fabricated from absorber compound annealed at 525 and 575℃, the solar cell fabricated from the absorber annealed at 550℃ exhibited the best conversion efficiency of 3.82% with Voc 434mV, Jsc 18.33mA/cm2, FF 47.0% and retained nearly 90% power conversion efficiency (PCE) stability after time period of 60 days.

Abstract: Busulfan (Bu)-based preparative regimens in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are commonly used. Previous studies have shown that Bu at a fixed dose of 3.2mg/kg/day (FBD) given intravenously decreases variability in drug pharmacokinetics and this decreases the dependency on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of Bu. We compared the Bu dose given using TDM with the FBD of 3.2mg/kg/day. Seventy-three patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplasia, chronic myeloid leukemia, thalassemia major, and sickle cell disease were included. The mean age at transplant was 15years (range 2–55years) with 57% adults. Indication for transplantation was leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome in 46% of the patients, while the remaining 54% were transplanted for inherited blood disorders. We found that the median FBD was lower than the median TDM dose by 39mg/day with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) even after adjusting for the weight (median total FBD of 349mg, median TDM dose of 494mg, p<0.0001). Age and underlying condition (malignant vs. nonmalignant) were the main factors affecting Bu clearance (p<0.001 and p<0.07, respectively). TDM remains an important tool for the appropriate dosing of Bu in preparative regimens of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially in populations with genetic admixture.

Abstract: An easy method to obtain kesterite Cu2ZnSn(Se1−x,Sx)4 (CZTSSe) thin films as absorbers for photovoltaic solar cells is discussed in this report. Particular emphasis is directed towards preparation steps of CZTSSe, as well as its crystal structure and properties. The CZTSSe has been developed by a low-cost and sustainable aqueous precipitation method that included metal selenite´s precipitation, its reduction to metal selenides and further crystallization of kesterite. The use of an aqueous solution instead of organic compounds and sulfurization process at atmospheric conditions makes this process attractive for large-scale industrial fabrication of CZTSSe thin film solar cells. The kesterite CZTSSe solid solution has been characterized in terms of its chemical composition, structural and morphological transformations and optical and electrical properties, confirming the viability and effectiveness of the applied process. The optimal electrical parameters were found to be: 21.5mA/cm2 short circuit current (Jsc), 532mV open circuit voltage (Voc), 42.8% fill factor (FF) and total area efficiency of 4.9% (Eff) without antireflection coating.

Abstract: Generation of myelin antigen-specific T cells is a major event in neuroimmune responses that causes demyelination. The antigen-priming of T cells and its location is important in chronic and acute inflammation. In autoimmune multiple sclerosis, the effector T cells are considered to generate in periphery. However, the reasons for chronic relapsing-remitting events are obscure. Considering mechanisms, a feasible aim of research is to investigate the role of antigen-primed T cells in lupus cerebritis. Last thirty years of investigations emphasize the relevance of microglia and infiltrated dendritic cells/macrophages as antigen presenting cells in the central nervous system. The recent approach towards circulating B-lymphocytes is an important area in the context. Here, we analyze the existing findings on antigen presentation in the central nervous system. The aim is to visualize signaling events of myelin antigen presentation to T cells and lead to the strategy of future goals on immunotherapy research.

Abstract: To improve the dispersion of graphene oxide (GO) and form effective synergistic effect between GO and WS2 nanosheets, the layer-by-layer electrostatic assembly method was used to synthesize three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide/WS2 nanosheet/Mg-doped ZnO nanohybrid (rGOWMZ). The enhancement of photocatalytic activity of a reduced graphene oxide/Mg-doped ZnO composites (rGOMZ) was achieved through introducing WS2 nanoplate, in which the decomposition rate of Rhodamine B (RhB) reached 100% within 5min. Furthermore, the rGOWMZ hybrids possess better anti-bacterial activity in dark than rGOMZ hybrid. The enhanced sunlight-driven photocatalytic and anti-bacterial activities are mainly attributed to defect and efficient electron-hole separation.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the corrosion of A516 carbon steel in the binary Solar Salt (60wt% NaNO3/40wt% KNO3) by dynamic immersion test at 500°C. To this end, a novel patented experimental facility enabling dynamic degradation tests of materials in contact with molten mediums was developed and used. Experimental results showed greater corrosion rates and thicker oxide layers in samples subjected to dynamic tests than the static ones. The dynamic test facility allows the simulation of (such as flux, thermocycling, etc.) of a CSP plant. The patented experimental pilot plant is a great step forward in learning about the physicochemical properties and behaviour of molten salts and also behaviour of substrates in contact with them under realistic working conditions.

Abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis is a common outcome of a variety of pulmonary interstitial diseases, and myofibroblasts are the main culprit for this process. Recent studies have found that pericytes are one of the major sources of myofibroblasts; the transformation of which involves a complex process of activation of TGF-β/Smad2/3 and PDGFβ/Erk signaling pathways. We have reported that the transforming growth factor-β receptor and platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor (TGF-βR I and PDGFβR, respectively) are modified by glycosylation. Thus, we hope to regulate the above-mentioned signal pathways through core fucosylation (CF) catalyzed by α-1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8). Previous work has confirmed that TGF-β1 can induce the transformation of pericytes into myofibroblasts, while FUT8siRNA can inhibit such transformation. In the present study, we used an adenovirus packaging FUT8 shRNA to infect a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model and determined the effect of CF on pulmonary fibrosis by analyzing the mechanism of CF-mediated pericyte transformation. Our findings may shed new light on the mechanism of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and provide a novel therapeutic target for clinical applications.

Endoplasmic reticulum-targeting photosensitizer Hypericin confers chemo-sensitization towards oxaliplatin through inducing pro-death autophagy,

Abstract: Hypericin is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-located photosensitizer, which causes oxidative damage to ER during photodynamic therapy (PDT). Hypericin-mediated PDT (HY-PDT) has been confirmed to enhance chemo-sensitivity of oxaliplatin (L-OHP) in colon cancer cells. The present study reveals that autophagy plays a key role in chemosensitization during HY-PDT. We proved pro-death autophagy was required for sensitization and HY-PDT/L-OHP antitumor synergism. High dosage of HY-PDT induced autophagic cell death; while low dose of HY-PDT predominantly triggered protective autophagy and promoted cell proliferation. Low dose of HY-PDT reduced the cytotoxicity of L-OHP in oxaliplatin-resistant colon cancer cells. Different level of autophagy therefore contributed to the opposite effect of HY-PDT on cell fate and chemo-sensitivity. Furthermore, we revealed the role of CHOP as a regulator connecting pro-survival and pro-death autophagy under ER damage. High dose of HY-PDT induced massive ROS generation and severe ER stress, which then led to induction of CHOP. CHOP thereby activated CHOP/TRIB3/Akt/mTOR cascade and triggered autophagic cell death. Additionally, when apoptotic pathway was blocked, cells treated with high dose of HY-PDT preferentially underwent death through autophagic pathway. On the other hand, suppression of autophagy made cells more vulnerable to apoptosis under low dose of HY-PDT. These results provided new evidences for the clinical application of ER-targeting PDT in modifying chemosensitivity of colorectal cancer therapy.

Abstract: Clostridium beijerinckii 4693:int with high ferulic acid (FA) tolerance was engineered and characterized in our lab. In this study, the minimum inhibition concentrations of FA against C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 (wild-type) and 4693:int were 1.0 and 1.5g/l, respectively; cell viability was 18.5% and 106.7%, respectively, in the presence of 0.5g/l FA. A comparative transcriptome analysis was carried out at two different growth stages to evaluate sensitivity to FA. Genes that were differentially expressed included those related to redox and associated cofactors, riboflavin metabolism, two-component system, glycolysis and butanoate metabolism, and DNA replication as well as those encoding ATP-binding cassette transporters. Cbei_2134 and Cbei_2135 encoding alkyl hydroperoxide reductases are thought to be involved in antibacterial and adaptation mechanisms in C. beijerinckii in the presence of FA.

Abstract: The role of the kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a well-known protein engaged in DNA damage repair, in the regulation of neuronal responses to oxidative stress remains unexplored. Thus, the neuroprotective efficacy of KU-55933, a potent inhibitor of ATM, against cell damage evoked by oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide, H2O2) has been studied in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and compared with the efficacy of this agent in models of doxorubicin (Dox)- and staurosporine (St)-evoked cell death. KU-55933 inhibited the cell death induced by H2O2 or Dox but not by St in undifferentiated (UN-) and retinoic acid-differentiated (RA)-SH-SY5Y cells, with a more pronounced effect in the latter cell phenotype. Furthermore, this ATM inhibitor attenuated the Dox- but not H2O2-induced caspase-3 activity in both UN- and RA-SH-SY5Y cells. Although KU-55933 inhibited the H2O2- and Dox-induced activation of ATM, it attenuated the toxin-induced phosphorylation of the proteins H2AX and p53 only in the latter model of cell damage. Moreover, the ATM inhibitor prevented the H2O2-evoked increases in calpain and cathepsin D activity and attenuated cell damage to a similar degree as inhibitors of calpain (MDL28170) and cathepsin D (pepstatin A). Finally, we confirmed the neuroprotective potential of KU-55933 against the H2O2- and Dox-evoked cell damage in primary mouse cerebellar granule cells and in the mouse hippocampal HT-22 cell line. Altogether, our results extend the neuroprotective portfolio of KU-55933 to a model of oxidative stress, with this effect not involving inhibition of the γH2AX/p-p53/caspase-3 pathway and instead associated with the attenuation of calpain and cathepsin D activity.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary central nervous system malignant tumor. It responds poorly to standard therapies, such as surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Many chemotherapeutic drugs are focused on apoptosis induction and radiation sensitivity. Inhibition of histone acetylation via histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) is one such strategy. Statins (or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) are classical drugs used to lower cholesterol but also inhibitors of histone deacetylation activity. This study analyzes the combinatory effects of valproic acid (VPA) and fluvastatin on apoptosis induction in GBM8401 cells. The results show that they act synergistically in inducing γ-H2AX and apoptosis accompanied by higher acetylated histones H3 and H4. Downregulation of p53 occurred by VPA alone and fluvastatin alone, but not at their combined application; upregulation of p21 at the protein level was induced by each of the drugs alone and no further increase occurred at combined application. The drug BEZ235 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and attenuated the level of γ-H2AX as well as cleaved PARP (cPARP) induced at combined application of VPA and fluvastatin. Induction of apoptosis within a 48h incubation period was massive when measured as the subG1 peak (97%) and was detected after a 24h incubation at low level when assayed with PE Annexin V. Synergistic apoptosis induction was demonstrated also after 24h incubation by the appearance of cPARP. Partial silencing of p21 reduced cPARP as well as the percentage of apoptotic cells in the subG1 peak. However, partial silencing of p53 had no effect on apoptosis. Such findings offer a better understanding of the mechanism of action of HDACIs in combination with statins that may guide the development of a new combinatory reposition for the treatment of GBM.

Abstract: Preeclampsia (PE) is a major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PE progression are not well characterized. Here, we investigated the role of miR-218 in PE development. The expression of miR-218 and its host genes SLIT2 and SLIT3 was up-regulated in preeclamptic placentae compared to normal placentae. miR-218 expression was induced by hypoxia and decreased after knockdown of HIF-1α in an extravillous trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed direct binding of HIF-1α to the promoters of SLIT2 and SLIT3. Bioinformatics analysis identified LASP1 as a direct target of miR-218. Overexpression of miR-218 repressed the expression of LASP1 at both the mRNA and protein level. Meanwhile, miR-218 repressed the activity of a luciferase reporter containing the 3′-untranslated region of the LASP1 gene. Furthermore, expression of LASP1 rescued the inhibitory effect of miR-218 on HTR-8/SVneo cell invasion. Together, these results indicated that miR-218 contributes to PE by targeting LASP1 to inhibit trophoblast invasion.

Abstract: There is no doubt that renewable sources, such as solar energy, have played an important role in the future renewable energy system. And solar heat has great potential and a high contribution towards the future energy supply. How to directly collect, fast convert and efficiently store solar heat is still a problem to be solved in solar energy application. Herein, the di-functional nanocomposite film was designed and fabricated toward efficient conversion and storage of solar thermal energy. The di-functional nanocomposite film was feasibly prepared by uniformly imbedding phase change materials (PCMs) and Au nanoparticles into PVA matrix uniformly through the hydrogen-bonding interactions. The Au nanoparticles, as photothermal nanoabsorbers, with a low concentration (~0.23% m/m), can instantly and intensely realize solar-to-heat conversion by utilizing surface plasmon resonance. Subsequently, efficiently conversion heat could be stored into the PCMs through film-interior reversible phase transformation. Meanwhile, no leakage and evaporation of the PCMs is observed due to the strong hydrogen-bonding confinement at interface between PCMs and the film matrix. This kind of di-functional nanocomposite films is of great importance and wide usage in the fields of solar thermal energy conversion and storage, thermal interface materials, protective layers and sensing, etc.

Abstract: Organic phase change materials (PCMs) have many properties that make them desirable for integration in latent-heat solar thermal energy storage (TES) systems operating in the ambient-to-moderate temperature range, but there are significant gaps concerning their material properties, and their reliability. We present a comprehensive study of thermal and related properties (transition temperature, transition enthalpy change, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, density), thermal stability (on cycling through the transition up to 3000 times) and chemical stability (when in contact with 16 common containment materials at 75°C) for six organic phase change materials: decanoic acid (aka capric acid, [CH3(CH2)8COOH]), dodecanoic acid (aka lauric acid, [CH3(CH2)10COOH]), tetradecanoic acid (aka myristic acid, [CH3(CH2)12COOH]), hexadecanoic acid (aka palmitic acid, [CH3(CH2)14COOH]), octadecanoic acid (aka stearic acid, [CH3(CH2)16COOH]) and 1-octadecanol ([CH3(CH2)17OH]). All show melting transitions in the temperature range 30–70°C which is suitable for solar thermal applications, with substantial enthalpy changes (>145Jg-1), and all are thermally stable over 3000 cycles. These materials all have significant potential for solar thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: Seed-assisted cast quasi-single crystalline silicon (Qsc-Si) technique allows the production of efficient, low-cost solar cells. However, most of the Qsc-Si wafers still consist of single- and multi-crystalline silicon grains, which lead to difficulties when attempting to achieve high efficiency by using conventional acid or alkali texture processes. This paper highlights the fact that nano-textured Qsc-Si solar cells can reach efficiencies ranging from 18.4% to 18.9% by using the same metal-catalyzed chemical etching technique, along with a depressed color difference. A parallel sub-cell model is proposed to explain how to enhance the performance of Qsc-Si cells.

Abstract: It is a long-standing challenge in the fabrication of single-phase VO2 films at low temperature on Si substrate or glass substrate due to their thermodynamic phase-instability and the polymorphic structures. Recently, the demand for high-quality thin films deposited at low temperature is strongly pushed by their applications on devices and smart windows. Thermochromic films of VO2, as well as multilayer films of VO2/ZnO and VO2/TiO2/ZnO, were made by magnetron sputtering method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV–visible-NIR spectrophotometer, (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) and Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Films with high crystalline degree VO2 single crystal phase were obtained at a fairly low temperature of 300°C without subsequent annealing by embedding ZnO and TiO2 layers between VO2 and substrates. It is demonstrated that VO2/TiO2/ZnO films could display higher luminous transmittance and better semiconductor to metal transition (SMT) performance. Our data can serve a promising point for industrial production with high degree of crystallinity at a low temperature.

Abstract: Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) system with storage can provide consistent power and thus are attractive relative to intermittent power sources, e.g., solar photovoltaics and wind. Mixed molten salt is a promising medium for both heat transfer and energy storage in solar thermal power because of its many advantages such as large heat capacity, low vapor pressure, low cost, wide range of temperature in application, etc. However, there are the disadvantages of higher melting point and poor thermal stability with the commonly mixed molten salts, such as Solar salt (60wt%NaNO3+40wt%KNO3, melting point @220°C, limit use of temperature @565°C). In order to obtain molten salt with lower melting point and better short-term thermal stability, 14 kinds of mixed molten salts are obtained by adjusting the component ratio and adding carbonates or nitrates based on Solar salt. Through the Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric (TG) methods, their melting point, crystallization point, thermal decomposition temperature and short-term thermal stability are measured. 4 kinds of mixed molten salts are selected preliminarily at last. Their melting points and decomposition temperatures are about 100°C and 600°C respectively. They show good short-term thermal stability in the 4-days repeated heating-cooling experiments. The specific heat and sensible thermal storage cost of preferred molten salts were also obtained.

Abstract: Background
Immunoglobulins(Igs)play an important role in host defence and were initially thought to be expressed solely by B cells. However, recent data suggest that Igs are also expressed in other lineages. Recently, Ig transcripts were detected in cardiomyocytes, but whether the functional Ig protein is expressed by cardiomyocytes has not been thoroughly elucidated.
Methods
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray database analysis was used to analyse IgM heavy chain expression in the myocardium of mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), ELISA and Western blot were used to identify IgM in cardiomyocytes of both Balb/c mice and μMT mice (B cell-deficient mice), as well as in cultured cardiomyocytes of neonatal mice and in the myocardial cell line HL-1. Moreover, RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing were used to determine the VDJ rearrangement of the IgM heavy chain.
Results
In this study, we first analysed transcription of the IgM heavy chain in heart tissue in mice by mining the GEO database, and we observed that IgM heavy chain transcripts were expressed in heart tissues. Subsequently, IgM was found to be expressed in cardiomyocytes in mice; the IgM was primarily localized on the cell membranes and intercalated discs of murine heart cells and in the cytoplasm and cell membranes of isolated cardiomyocytes and HL-1. Importantly, the functional IgM heavy chain transcripts exhibit a unique VDJ rearrangement pattern. Furthermore, IgM can be secreted and deposited in the extracellular space of the myocardium under ischaemic/hypoxic conditions.
Conclusions
Our data indicate for the first time that IgM is expressed by cardiomyocytes in mice and suggest that its physiological function warrants further investigation.

Abstract: Advances in organic photovoltaics have created the opportunity for low-cost, high-throughput manufacture of solar cells using roll-to-roll printing technology; however, the performance, reliability, and production yield of these devices can be critically limited by the incorporation of defects during fabrication. The detection and elimination of all printing defects is unrealistic, so techniques are required to identify those types of defects which are most critical to solar cell functionality. Here, we combine mapping of both surface topography and photovoltaic properties in order to understand the impact of various types of defect on the functional performance. To enable this comparison, transient photocurrent and photovoltage mapping is demonstrated as a technique for measuring local variation in charge carrier dynamics. We find that dust particle contamination corresponds with localised reductions in charge extraction rate. This novel measurement technique provides a way to distinguish between different types of defect by considering both the magnitude and dynamics of the local transient responses.

Abstract: Evaluating the impact of grain boundaries on the functional properties of CdTe thin films, consistent with processes used in photovoltaic solar cells, requires a direct correlation between their crystallography and electronic behavior. In the present work, we propose a novel comprehensive approach, combining focused ion beam/electron backscatter diffraction tomography (3D-EBSD) and quantitative cathodoluminescence (CL). While the former enables a full five parameter characterization of the interfaces, the latter is used to probe the spatial distribution of recombination centers and their characteristics. In addition, critical issues associated with sample preparation are also discussed. Monte Carlo simulations, together with electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI), are employed to evaluate the effects of ion-sputtering damage on the CL response of CdTe thin films, as well as to overcome the resolution limit of EBSD characterization. The results obtained show that, at the exception of coherent twin boundaries, all interfaces behave as non-radiative recombination centers, exhibiting significant recombination velocities. Furthermore, there is no direct correlation between the misorientation parameters of the interfaces and their recombination properties. In contrast, trends can be observed when considering the crystallography of the boundary planes.

Abstract: In this work, a simple and effective method for fabricating Sb2Se3 nano-rods films by magnetron sputtering Sb2Se3 alloy target at a substrate temperature of 375°C is proposed. The thermally induced regular shape and vertically arrayed nano-rods exhibits a well-crystallized structure with a preferred crystallographic orientation of (221) and a stable valence of Sb3+ and Se 2−. The obtained thin film has a band-gap of 1.32eV and a high absorption coefficient of 105cm−1 in visible region. The photo-electrochemical measurements show that the Sb2Se3 nano-rods are p-type semiconductors with an excellent photo-response. A photovoltaic solar cell using the Sb2Se3 nano-rods film as absorber has demonstrated and a clear photovoltaic effect with an encouraging power conversion efficiency of 2.11% can be achieved.

Abstract: In recent years, a defect on the surface of photovoltaic (PV) modules called ‘snail trails’ has become a widespread reliability issue, affecting many modules installed in the field. In this work, silver acetate is identified as one component of snail trails through non-destructive Raman analysis. The chemical reaction between the silver grid line, oxygen and acetic acid on top of the micro-crack is proposed as the mechanism. The generation and/or diffusion of acetic acid released from ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant, oxygen and moisture are modeled using finite element method to predict the formation of silver acetate. The simulation results indicate that the existence of micro-crack plus cell gap are necessary for snail trail formation and act as the pathway for transport. As the source of acetic acid, encapsulant plays an important role in snail trail formation. Oxygen transmission rate of backsheet also has significant influence on snail trail formation. Water vapor transmission rate is shown to have no effect on snail trials over a wide rate of transmission rates. An accelerated aging snail trail test has been developed that can simulate snail trails within days, and is compared to modeling and field results.

Abstract: Novel nanocomposite smart multifunctional materials are emerging as promising technological advances in construction industry, where thermal-energy efficiency needs should meet environmental sustainability and mechanical performance requirements. In this view, new cement-based materials showed encouraging results in terms of added functional properties combining all the above mentioned capabilities with electrical conductivity and self-sensing potential for a variety of field scopes, e.g. vibration measurements, damage detection, structural health monitoring, electromagnetic shielding, self-heating pavements for deicing and more. The present paper deals with the development and multipurpose experimental characterization of cement-based materials doped with different carbon nanoinclusions consisting of: multi-walled carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon black, and graphene nanoplatelets. The study investigates morphology, optical features, thermal characteristics, electrical properties and strain-sensing capability of the different composites, through a campaign of in-lab experimental measurements. The results highlight the peculiar behavior of each composite material, which is strictly related to the adopted nanoinclusions, that reveal to be suitable for specific purposes. In particular, all carbon nanoinclusions are seen to reduce solar reflectance capability, while they produce negligible variations in thermal emittance. Graphene nanoplatelets represent the most effective nanoinclusion to increase thermal conductivity and diffusivity, which is related to their structural and geometrical characteristics and better capability to distribute the thermal wave. Consistently, the same graphene samples produce the largest electrical conductivity and capacitance. However, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, even though providing comparatively smaller contributions to electrical conductivity, are seen to be the best nanoinclusions for providing strain-sensing capabilities to the cement-based composites.

Abstract: Our previous studies have demonstrated that KLF4 is a critical transcription factor that promotes the odontoblastic differentiation of dental papilla cells. Klf4 mRNA was found to be regulated by multiple microRNAs (miRNAs). Competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) are a group of transcripts post-transcriptionally regulating each other by competing for their common miRNAs. However, the regulation of Klf4 by ceRNAs in odontoblastic differentiation remains unknown. In this study, we predicted a group of potential Klf4 ceRNAs with bioinformatics approach, and examined the expression of Klf4 and five interested potential ceRNAs including Sp1 using real-time PCR during odontoblastic differentiation of mDPC6T. The expression levels of both Sp1 and Klf4 were significantly upregulated during this process. In situ hybridization verified that Sp1 was co-expressed with Klf4 in the differentiating and the mature odontoblasts in vivo. Knockdown of Sp1 using siRNA resulted in a significant reduction of Klf4 and vice visa. This interaction was further confirmed to be miRNA dependent. Common miRNAs of Klf4 and Sp1 were predicted, among which miR-7a, miR-29b and miR-135a were able to downregulate both Klf4 and Sp1 expression after their separate overexpression in the mDPC6T cells. Dual luciferase assays showed that these miRNAs separately regulated the 3′UTRs of both Klf4 and Sp1, and the down-regulation of Klf4 3 ’UTR by Sp1 siRNA was abolished when these three miRNAs’ binding sites were mutated in the Klf4 3 ’UTR. Therefore, our results indicate that Sp1 functions as a ceRNA of Klf4 during odontoblastic differentiation through competing for miR-7a, miR-29b and miR-135a.

Abstract: Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are multipotent stromal cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including skin cells, and they can provide an abundant source of cells for skin tissue engineering and skin wound healing. The purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effects of activin B in combination with ADSCs and the possible signaling mechanism. In this study, we found that activin B was able to promote ADSC migration by inducing actin stress fiber formation in vitro. In vivo, activin B in combination with ADSCs was capable of enhancing α-SMA expression and wound closure. This combined treatment also promoted fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation and accelerated re-epithelialization and collagen deposition. Moreover, activin B in combination with ADSCs boosted angiogenesis in the wound area. Further study of the mechanism revealed that activation of JNK and ERK signaling, but not p38 signaling, were required for activin B-induced ADSC actin stress fiber formation and cell migration. These results showed that activin B was able to activate JNK and ERK signaling pathways to induce actin stress fiber formation and ADSC migration to promote wound healing. These results suggest that combined treatment with activin B and ADSCs is a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of serious skin wounds.

Abstract: The combination of its sorption capacity, reaction enthalpy, melting temperatures around available industrial waste heat and solar source and high thermal efficiency (compared to others salt hydrates) makes strontium bromide and its two respective hydrates a potential material for low temperature energy storage and building applications. It is considered among suitable materials for low thermochemical and sorption energy storage application (N’Tsoukpoe et al. [7]) due to its high-energy storage density and end-user temperature. Strontium bromide is simultaneously considered as a phase change and a thermochemical material. A short analysis of the general physical and chemical properties such as thermodynamics, melting temperature, density, sorption kinetics, exergy, thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity and permeability highlights the advantageous properties. The review on the use of strontium bromide in pure or modified form is further extended to applications such as building structure, composite design for thermal storage, and heating and cooling. The usefulness and disadvantages of its use in closed/open processes are discussed. Possible solutions to issues are further presented or proposed.

Abstract: The proper optical characterization of solar reflector materials is a challenging task. Although several commercial instruments exist to measure reflectance, they have been developed for other applications and often do not meet all the specific requirements demanded by the solar thermal industry. In particular, the characterization of solar reflectors involve the complete solar spectral wavelength range, an incidence angle range from near normal to 70° and most importantly a very narrow acceptance angle range from near specular to 20 mrad. The accurate measurement of reflectance as a function of all the previously mentioned parameters has not been commercially implemented. This paper reviews the different alternatives to measure reflector materials, describes reflectance models used to approximate the missing information and presents current research work on prototype reflectometers to fill the gap.

Abstract: Tantalum carbide, as a Ultra-High Temperature Ceramic, is known to be characterized by intrinsic spectral selectivity, which makes it attractive for novel high-temperature thermal solar absorbers. However, a weakness point of TaC is the solar absorbance, which, in absence of any treatment, is usually lower than that of other materials currently under development for solar absorber applications. In the present work we have investigated the effect of surface texturing by femtosecond laser machining on this superhard material. Laser-induced microstructural and optical property changes have been characterized in two samples with different starting roughness and for four laser treatments each, as a function of the accumulated laser fluence. As the interaction with the laser beam takes place and gets stronger, both surface and chemical composition changes appear. Optical properties are heavily affected: solar absorbance considerably increases, at a slight expense of spectral selectivity.

Abstract: Micro-structured surfaces for broadband and omnidirectional photon management in photovoltaic-thermoelectric systems are fabricated on the silicon wafer by inductively coupled plasma etching with self-assembly polystyrene spheres mask, KOH solution etching and magnetron sputtering method. The Si antireflection structure coated with SiO2 film is fabricated on the top surface of Si substrate to enhance the absorption of the photons with wavelengths of 0.3–1.1µm is increase the electron-hole pairs. The TiO2/SiO2 films as the back-antireflection coating are deposited at the back of Si wafer to improve the transmission of solar energy within the wavelength range of 1.1–2.5µm. The absorbed photons within the wavelength range of 0.3–1.1µm can directly be converted into electricity power by Si solar cells while the photons with wavelengths of 1.1–2.5µm transmit through the cells and are utilized by thermoelectric modules. The effects of etching parameters on the spectral features are investigated to get the optimal etching parameters. With the optimal etching parameters, the surface absorption for the wavelengths of 0.3–1.1µm is significantly increased to above 0.95 due to the effective graded refractive index and the transmission is obviously enhanced for the wavelengths of 1.1–2.5µm. The incident angle-sensitivity and polarization-sensitivity of the fabricated structured surfaces are analyzed. The results indicate that these surfaces can be selected for photovoltaic-thermoelectric systems due to their high omnidirectional absorption and transmission of the photons as well as the favorable polarization-insensitivity within the expected wavelength ranges.

Abstract: A photochromic (PC) device comprising an electrochromic film (WO3) together with a photoactive film (usually, dye sensitized TiO2) coated on glass and a redox electrolyte (e.g., iodide/triiodide together with lithium salt) reduces the optical transmission under solar illumination and bleaches, again, in dark or at low intensity of light. This work reports, for first time, on an application of sputter coated TiO2 and WO3 films for this type of PC devices. The applicability of TiO2 and WO3 films in PC device is individually investigated in dye solar cells and electrochromic cells, respectively. A dye solar cell with 180nm TiO2 was shown to be sufficient for the charge generation for electrochromic coloration of the WO3. The compatibility of WO3 and redox electrolyte was studied in electrochromic devices by considering their redox potentials. The bleaching of the PC device has to be adjusted by the so called “loss current”. To address this, a thin catalytic layer of platinum (Pt) is deposited in between the photoactive and electrochromic layers. The optimized PC device exhibits a visual (solar) transmission modulation from 74 (63) down to 30% (20%) in 40min under 1.5 A.M. illumination, and the bleaching is regained in 45min in dark.

Abstract: A simple but effective method for improving the perovskite film quality by adding bidentate halogenated additives into the precursor solution of perovskite was proposed. By comparing and analyzing the effects of the use of different additives on the film-forming performances, DIO was selected as the optimal additive. The optimal additive amount of DIO could contribute to a more uniform and non-defective growth of perovskite crystal nucleation, enabling preparation of the smooth and compact film with large grain size. The effect mechanism of the chelation between DIO and Pb2+ on the film-forming process of perovskite crystal was also analyzed. The PCE of the PSC device incorporating the DIO is runned up to 19.1%, accounting for a 73.6% enhancement as compared to pre-optimized control PSCs. Conclusively, using the proposed technology, the conversion efficiency of the prepared 5cm×5cm device reaches up to 11.2%, which can be applicable to the preparation of large-area perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Background
The t(8;14)(q24.1;q32) and its variants – the t(2;8)(p12;q24.1) and t(8;22)(q24.1;q11.2) are associated with B-cell neoplasia and result in MYC/immunoglobulin (IG) gene rearrangement.
Patients and methods
We correlated the cytogenetic, molecular and clinico-pathological findings of patients with 8q24 translocations seen in the Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, from January 2003 to December 2015.
Results
There were 34 patients with 8q24 translocations (31, ALL and three myeloma). The t(8;14) was seen in 25 patients, t(8;22) in seven and t(2;8) in two. The salient findings were as follows: 85% males; 79% adults, median age 37 years; L3 morphology in 61%; mature B immunophenotype in 77%; extra-medullary disease in 41%; additional abnormalities in 28 (85%), notably, structural abnormalities of chromosome 1q (41%) and 13q (9%) and monosomy 13 (15%); complex karyotypes in 68%. There were two double-hit lymphoma/leukemia, one with a t(14;18)(q32;q21) and the other with a t(3;14)(q27;q11.2), associated with nodal high grade B cell lymphoma and dermal leukemic infiltrates respectively. Only 13 samples were processed for DNA PCR and all these samples were positive for MYC-IgH (c-gamma type) rearrangement. Only in one patient, in addition to c-gamma, c-alpha rearrangement was also detected.
Conclusion
The frequency (1.7%) and distribution of these translocations in our series and the association with 1q and 13q abnormalities is similar to the literature. Trisomies 7 and 12 were seen in less than 10% of our patients.

Abstract: Combined suspended particle device (SPD)-vacuum glazing is a potential adaptive glazing for low energy building application. Glazing transmission is an essential parameter to determine indoor comfort level of building due to glazing. In this work, above 0.5 clearness index, a strong correlation between glazing transmission and clearness index (Atmospheric transmission) has been evaluated for south facing vertical plane glazing. Below 0.5 clearness index, isotropic diffuse transmittance was dominant and one single value of glazing transmission was found which is suitable for building energy calculation throughout the year. Below 0.5 clearness index, for south facing vertical plane SPD-vacuum glazing transmission was 17% and 1.1% for transparent and opaque states respectively.

Abstract: Solar absorber coatings are said to be “cost-effective” when significant efficiency gains are achieved with an acceptable additional cost. Here, an integrated approach to solar power technologies is used for quantifying more rigorously the cost-effectiveness of coatings in the concentrating solar power (CSP) industry. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) metric is used in an original way that attributes a cost-effectiveness value to any high-temperature absorber coating via a figure of merit named the LCOE gain efficiency. The LCOE gain efficiency is demonstrated on three different solar absorber coatings: Pyromark 2500, lanthanum strontium manganite oxide (LSM), and cobalt oxide (Co3O4), that coat a hypothetical 100MWe central tower receiver. To perform the calculation of the LCOE gain efficiency, accelerated aging tests and cost estimates are performed. Depending on the coating properties, an optimal reapplication interval may be found that minimizes the LCOE of the plant, i.e., maximizes the LCOE gain efficiency. In such optimal conditions—and for this typical power tower—Pyromark 2500 paint enables a higher LCOE gain efficiency (0.182) than both LSM (0.139) and Co3O4 (0.083). The solar absorptance is by far the most influential parameter. The cost-effectiveness of Pyromark could be outperformed by a coating that would have a high initial solar absorptance (>0.95), a low initial degradation rate (<2×10−6 cycle−1), and a low cost (<$500k per application). Application of the LCOE gain efficiency can provide a consistent and objective method to evaluate a variety of receiver designs and other components.

Abstract: Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in the perinatal period can lead to significant neurological deficits in later life. Total body cooling (TBC) is a neuroprotective strategy used in the treatment of HIE and has been shown to reduce seizures and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in treated infants. Little is known, however, about the effects of HIE/TBC on the developing gut microbiota composition and subsequent metabolic profile. Ten term infants with HIE who received TBC at 33.5°C for 72h were recruited. A control group consisted of nine healthy full term infants. Faecal samples were collected from both groups at 2 years of age and stored at −20°C. 16S rRNA amplicon Illumina sequencing was carried out to determine gut microbiota composition and 1H NMR analysis was performed to determine the metabolic profile of faecal water. The gut microbiota composition of the HIE/TBC infants were found to have significantly lower proportions of Bacteroides compared to the non-cooled healthy control group. Alpha diversity measures detected significantly lower diversity in microbial richness in the HIE/TBC infant group compared to the control infants (Shannon index, <0.05). High inter-individual variation was found in gut microbiota composition and metabolic profile of both groups. Initial principal coordinate analysis and hierarchal clustering of compounds on MetaboAnalyst 3.0 indicated no clear separation in the metabolic profile of these two infant groups. These results suggest that there is no significant impact on the gut microbial development of HIE/TBC infants compared to healthy infants at 2years of life. To our knowledge this is the first study to report the gut microbiota composition and metabolic profile of infants who have experienced HIE/TBC at birth.

Abstract: We present an optical spectroscopy study of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin films deposited on Mo/glass substrates. The [Cu]/[Zn+Sn] ratio in these films varies from nearly stoichiometric to strongly Cu deficient and Zn rich. Increasing Cu deficiency and Zn excess widens the bandgap Eg, determined using photoluminescence excitation (PLE) at 4.2K, from 0.99eV to 1.03eV and blue shifts the dominant band in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra from 0.83eV to 0.95eV. The PL spectra of the near stoichiometric film reveal two bands: a dominant band centred at 0.83eV and a lower intensity one at 0.93eV. The temperature and excitation intensity dependence of the PL spectra help to identify the recombination mechanisms of the observed emission bands as free-to-bound: recombination of free electrons with holes localised at acceptors affected by randomly distributed potential fluctuations. Both the mean depth of such fluctuations, determined by analysing the shape of the dominant bands, and the broadening energy, estimated from the PLE spectra, become smaller with increasing Cu deficiency and Zn excess which also widens Eg due to an improved ordering of the Cu/Zn atoms. These changes in the elemental composition induce a significant blue shift of the PL bands exceeding the Eg widening. This is attributed to a change of the dominant acceptor for a shallow one, and is beneficial for the solar cell performance. Film regions with a higher degree of Cu/Zn ordering are present in the near stoichiometric film generating the second PL band at 0.93eV.
