Abstract: microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play key roles in post transcriptional gene regulation that influence various fundamental cellular processes, including the cellular responses during environmental stresses. However, perusal of literatures revealed few reports on the differential expression of miRNA during thermal stress in Indian native (Bos indicus) cattle breeds. The present investigation aimed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs during thermal stress in Sahiwal (Bos indicus) dairy cattle breed of India, adapted with tropical climate over a long period of time. Stress responses of the animals were characterized by determining various physiological as well as biochemical parameters and differential expression profile of major heat shock protein genes. Ion Torrent deep sequencing and CLC-genomic analysis identified a set of differentially expressed miRNAs during summer and winter seasons. Most of the identified differentially expressed miRNAs were found to target heat shock responsive genes especially members of heat shock protein (HSP) family. Real-time quantification-based analysis of selected miRNAs revealed that bta-mir-1248, bta-mir-2332, bta-mir-2478, and bta-mir-1839 were significantly (p < 0.01) over expressed while bta-mir-16a, bta-let-7b, bta-mir-142, and bta-mir-425 were significantly (p < 0.01) under expressed during summer in comparison to winter. The present study enlists differentially expressed miRNAs at different environmental temperatures in Sahiwal (Bos indicus) that may be importance for further understanding the role of miRNAs on thermo-regulatory mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle stem cell (MuSC) function declines with age and contributes to impaired muscle regeneration in older individuals. Acting through AMPK/p27Kip1, we have identified a pathway regulating the balance between autophagy, apoptosis, and senescence in aged MuSCs. While p27Kip1 is implicated in MuSC aging, its precise role and molecular mechanism have not been elucidated. Age-related MuSC dysfunction was associated with reduced autophagy, increased apoptosis, and hypophosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target p27Kip1. AMPK activation or ectopic expression of a phosphomimetic p27Kip1 mutant was sufficient to suppress in vitro apoptosis, increase proliferation, and improve in vivo transplantation efficiency of aged MuSCs. Moreover, activation of the AMPK/p27Kip1 pathway reduced markers of cell senescence in aged cells, which was, in part, dependent on p27Kip1 phosphorylation. Thus, the AMPK/p27Kip1 pathway likely regulates the autophagy/apoptosis balance in aged MuSCs and may be a potential target for improving muscle regeneration in older individuals.

Abstract: Tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) play an important role in the escape of tumor cells from immune surveillance. However, the details of the mechanism are not fully understood. In this study, the apoptosis of CD4+ T cells increased during treatment with B16-derived exosomes in vitro and in vivo, resulting in accelerated growth of melanoma cells in mice. While the release of exosomes was blocked by disrupting the expression of Rab27a, tumor growth was clearly inhibited, and the percentage of T cells in the tumor environment increased. At the same time, Western blot showed that TEX could increase the activation of caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 but not caspase-8, down-regulating the anti-apoptotic proteins, including BCL-2, MCL-1 and BCL-xL in CD4+ T cells, and indicating that the TEX activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway of CD4+ T cells. These reductions were probably associated with the release of microRNAs, such as miR-690, from TEX to T cells. Our present study reveals for the first time that melanoma-released exosomes may directly activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway of CD4+ T cells through their microRNA cargo.

Self-complementary and tyrosine-mutant rAAV vectors enhance transduction in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells,

Abstract: Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector platforms have shown considerable therapeutic success in gene therapy for inherited disorders. In cystic fibrosis (CF), administration of first-generation rAAV2 was safe, but clinical benefits were not clearly demonstrated. Therefore, next-generation vectors that overcome rate-limiting steps in rAAV transduction are needed to obtain successful gene therapy for this devastating disease. In this study, we evaluated the effects of single-strand or self-complementary (sc) rAAV vectors containing single or multiple tyrosine-to-phenylalanine (Y-F) mutations in capsid surface-exposed residues on serotypes 2, 8 or 9. For this purpose, CF bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells were transduced with rAAV vectors, and the transgene expression of enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) was analyzed at different time points. The effects of vectors on the cell viability, host cell cycle and in association with co-adjuvant drugs that modulate intracellular vector trafficking were also investigated. Six rAAV vectors demonstrated greater percentage of eGFP+ cells compared to their counterparts at days 4, 7 and 10 post-transduction: rAAV2 Y(272,444,500,730)F, with 1.95-, 3.5- and 3.06-fold increases; rAAV2 Y(252,272,444,500,704,730)F, with 1.65-, 2.12-, and 2-fold increases; scrAAV2 WT, with 1.69-, 2.68-, and 2.32-fold increases; scrAAV8 Y773F, with 57-, 6.06-, and 7-fold increases; scrAAV9 WT, with 7.47-, 4.64-, and 3.66-fold increases; and scrAAV9 Y446F, with 8.39-, 4.62-, and 4.4-fold increases. At days 15, 20, and 30 post-transduction, these vectors still demonstrated higher transgene expression than transfected cells. Although the percentage of eGFP+ cells reduced during the time-course analysis, the delta mean fluorescence intensity increased. These vectors also led to increased percentage of cells in G1-phase without eliciting any cytotoxicity. Prior administration of bortezomib or genistein did not increase eGFP expression in cells transduced with either rAAV2 Y(272,444,500,730)F or rAAV2 Y(252,272,444,500,704,730)F. In conclusion, self-complementary and tyrosine capsid mutations on rAAV serotypes 2, 8, and 9 led to more efficient transduction than their counterparts in CFBE cells by overcoming the intracellular trafficking and second-strand DNA synthesis limitations.

Abstract: Objectives
In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression pattern, clinicopathological significance and tumour suppressive properties of miR-15a in patients with colorectal carcinomas.
Methods
Tissue samples from 87 patients with primary colorectal carcinomas, 50 matched metastatic lymph node and 37 non-neoplastic colon (control) were prospectively recruited. The expression level of miR-15a was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Restoration/overexpression of the miR-15a was achieved by exogenous transfection. Four colon cancer cell lines (SW480, CaCO2, SW48 and HCT116) and a non-cancer colon cell line (FHC) were also used for examining the miR-15a induced tumour suppression properties using various in-vitro and immunological assays.
Results
Downregulation of miR-15a was noted in ~ 62% of the colorectal carcinoma tissues and it was positively correlated with the presence of cancer recurrence in patients with colorectal carcinomas (p = 0.05). Also, these patients with low miR-15a expression showed relatively shorter survival time when compared to those with miR-15a overexpression. Following miR-15a exogenous overexpression, colon cancer cells showed reduced cell proliferation, low colony formation, less cell invasion properties and mitochondrial respiration when compared to control cells. In addition, BCL2 and SOX2 proteins showed a significant downregulation following miR-15a overexpression suggesting its regulatory role in cancer growth, apoptosis and stemness.
Conclusion
This study has confirmed the tumour suppressor properties of miR-15a in colorectal cancers. Therefore, its modulation has potential implications in controlling various biological and pathogenic processes in colon carcinogenesis via targeting its downstream proteins such as BCL2 and SOX2.

Abstract: The malaria parasite has a complex lifecycle, including several events of differentiation and stage progression, while actively evading immunity in both its mosquito and human hosts. Important parasite gene expression and regulation during these events remain hidden in rare populations of cells. Here, we combine a capillary-based platform for cell isolation with single-cell RNA-sequencing to transcriptionally profile 165 single infected red blood cells (iRBCs) during the intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC). Unbiased analyses of single-cell data grouped the cells into eight transcriptional states during IDC. Interestingly, we uncovered a gene signature from the single iRBC analyses that can successfully discriminate between developing asexual and sexual stage parasites at cellular resolution, and we verify five, previously undefined, gametocyte stage specific genes. Moreover, we show the capacity of detecting expressed genes from the variable gene families in single parasites, despite the sparse nature of data. In total, the single parasite transcriptomics holds promise for molecular dissection of rare parasite phenotypes throughout the malaria lifecycle.

Abstract: Leukemia is a malignance with complex pathogenesis and poor prognosis. Discovery of noval regulators amenable to leukemia could be of value to gain insight into the pathogenesis, diagnosis and prognosis of leukemia. Here, we conducted a large-scale shRNA library screening for functional regulators in the development of myeloid cells in primary cells. We identified eighteen candidate regulators in the primary screening. Those genes cover a wide range of cellular functions, including gene expression regulation, intracellular signaling transduction, nucleotide excision repair, cell cycle control and transcription regulation. In both primary screening and validation, shRNAs targeting Tcea1, encoding the transcription elongation factor A (SII) 1, exhibited the greatest influence on the proliferative potential of cells. Knocking down the expression of Tcea1 in the 32Dcl3 myeloid cell line led to enhanced proliferation of myeloid cells and blockage of myeloid differentiation induced by G-CSF. In addition, silence of Tcea1 inhibited apoptosis of myeloid cells. Thus, Tcea1 was identified as a gene which can influence the proliferative potential, survival and differentiation of myeloid cells. These findings have implications for how transcriptional elongation influences myeloid cell development and leukemic transformation.

Abstract: Background
Our previous studies demonstrated that adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) could modulate regulatory T cells (Treg) and prolong hind-limb allotransplant survival in vitro and in vivo. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in innate and adaptive immunity. The aim of this study is to investigate the underlying mechanism of ASCs in modulating DC maturation.
Materials and Methods
ASCs were isolated from rodent adipose tissue, DCs were derived from the bone marrow, and CD4+ T cells were purified from splenocytes. DCs were co-cultured with ASCs to evaluate the suppressive effects of ASCs. CD4+ T-cells were co-cultured with DCs pre-treated with or without ASCs. The cell surface markers of DCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. T-cell proliferation was analyzed by the BrdU proliferation test. Tolerogenic cytokines and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expressions after different treatments were detected by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA analysis.
Result
ASCs suppressed DC maturation as evidenced by low expressions of CD80, CD86, and MHC-II. Also, ASC-treated mature DCs showed higher levels of TGF-β1, IL-10, and IDO expressions, as compared to that in matured DCs (mDCs) alone. ASC-treated mDCs co-cultured with CD4+ T cells revealed a significant higher percentage of Treg than mDC without treatment. The IDO level in ASC-treated mDCs and Treg induction effects were blocked by the ASCs pre-treated with TGF-β1 siRNAs, but not IL-10 siRNAs.
Conclusion
ASC-modulated DC maturation correlated with TGF-β1 secretion, IDO expression, and Treg induction. ASCs could be used as a potential immunomodulatory strategy for clinical application in allotransplantation.

Abstract: Hypoxia is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer (PC) and is associated with gemcitabine resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced gemcitabine resistance in PC remain greatly unknown. Our previous work showed that miR-301a, a hypoxia-sensitive miRNA, is involved in PC metastasis under hypoxia via regulation of its target gene P63. Here, we showed that miR-301a was upregulated in a NF-κB independent manner and promoted gemcitabine resistance under hypoxic conditions in vitro. In addition, TAp63, a member of the P63 family, reversed hypoxia-induced gemcitabine resistance by promoting degradation of HIF-1α. Furthermore, we proved that TAp63 was a functional downstream target of miR-301a and mediated the biological properties of miR-301a in PC. Taken together, these findings indicate that miR-301a exerts as a critical regulator involved in hypoxia-induced gemcitabine resistance in PC and may have potentials to be a therapeutic target for PC patients.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence suggests a key role of BAP1 in oncogenesis, but mechanisms regulating BAP1 gene expression remain unexplored. In this report, we revealed that the BAP1 promoter contains multiple G-tracts in its negative strand with high potential of forming G-quadruplex (G4) structures. In circular dichroism studies, synthesized oligonucleotides within these G-rich regions upstream the BAP1 transcription start site showed molar ellipticity at specific wavelengths characteristic of G4 structures. Analyses of these oligonucleotides by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed formation of multiple types of G4 structures. In reporter assays, mutations or deletion of predicted G4 structures reduced BAP1 promoter activity. Additionally, DNA helicases CHD2 and CHD7 could reduce BAP1 promoter activity, likely through unwinding its G4 structures.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms underlying cancer cell death caused by inhibitors of subcellular Hsp70 proteins have been elucidated. An inhibitor of Hsp70, apoptozole (Az), is mainly translocated into lysosomes of cancer cells where it induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization, thereby promoting lysosome-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, Az impairs autophagy in cancer cells owing to its ability to disrupt the lysosomal function. However, the Az-triphenylphosphonium conjugate, Az-TPP-O3, localizes mainly to mitochondria of cancer cells where it inhibits the mortalin-p53 interaction and induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, consequently leading to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Unlike Az, Az-TPP-O3 does not have an effect on autophagy in cancer cells. Collectively, the findings indicate that inhibitors of lysosomal Hsp70 and mitochondrial mortalin enhance cancer cell death via distinctively different mechanisms. Additionally, the findings arising from this effort demonstrate that studies aimed at determining subcellular locations and functions of small-molecule modulators provide a deeper understanding of their modes of action in cells.

Abstract: Summary
Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are traditionally thought to inhibit virus infection by preventing virion entry into target cells. In addition, antibodies can engage Fc receptors (FcRs) on immune cells to activate antiviral responses. We describe a mechanism by which NAbs inhibit chikungunya virus (CHIKV), the most common alphavirus infecting humans, by preventing virus budding from infected human cells and activating IgG-specific Fcγ receptors. NAbs bind to CHIKV glycoproteins on the infected cell surface and induce glycoprotein coalescence, preventing budding of nascent virions and leaving structurally heterogeneous nucleocapsids arrested in the cytosol. Furthermore, NAbs induce clustering of CHIKV replication spherules at sites of budding blockage. Functionally, these densely packed glycoprotein-NAb complexes on infected cells activate Fcγ receptors, inducing a strong, antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity response from immune effector cells. Our findings describe a triply functional antiviral pathway for NAbs that might be broadly applicable across virus-host systems, suggesting avenues for therapeutic innovation through antibody design.

Abstract: Summary
Repeated cycles of infection-associated lower airway inflammation drive the pathogenesis of persistent wheezing disease in children. In this study, the occurrence of acute respiratory tract illnesses (ARIs) and the nasopharyngeal microbiome (NPM) were characterized in 244 infants through their first five years of life. Through this analysis, we demonstrate that >80% of infectious events involve viral pathogens, but are accompanied by a shift in the NPM toward dominance by a small range of pathogenic bacterial genera. Unexpectedly, this change frequently precedes the detection of viral pathogens and acute symptoms. Colonization of illness-associated bacteria coupled with early allergic sensitization is associated with persistent wheeze in school-aged children, which is the hallmark of the asthma phenotype. In contrast, these bacterial genera are associated with “transient wheeze” that resolves after age 3 years in non-sensitized children. Thus, to complement early allergic sensitization, monitoring NPM composition may enable early detection and intervention in high-risk children.

Abstract: Summary
Helicobacter pylori (Hp) vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) is a bacterial exotoxin that enters host cells and induces mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the extent to which VacA-dependent mitochondrial perturbations affect overall cellular metabolism is poorly understood. We report that VacA perturbations in mitochondria are linked to alterations in cellular amino acid homeostasis, which results in the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and subsequent autophagy. mTORC1, which regulates cellular metabolism during nutrient stress, is inhibited during Hp infection by a VacA-dependent mechanism. This VacA-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 signaling is linked to the dissociation of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface and results in activation of cellular autophagy through the Unc 51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1) complex. VacA intoxication results in reduced cellular amino acids, and bolstering amino acid pools prevents VacA-mediated mTORC1 inhibition. Overall, these studies support a model that Hp modulate host cell metabolism through the action of VacA at mitochondria.

Abstract: T helper 17 (Th17) cells has proven to be crucial in the pathogenesis of severe asthma. Although it is known that Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is involved in differentiation of Th17 cells but, how it affects severe asthma is uncertain. Since previous studies indicated that Methtyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) null mice was deficient in Th17 cell differentiation, the aim of the present study was to understand how MBD2 interacts with SOCS3 to regulate Th17 cell differentiation in severe asthma. Here, we show that SOCS3 expression was significantly decreased in Th17-mediated severe asthmatic mice, accompanied by elevated STAT3 phosphorylation and RORγt expression. Knock-down of SOCS3 promoted the differentiation of naïve T cells into Th17 cells through STAT3/RORγt pathway. Meanwhile, MBD2 was overexpressed in Th17-mediated severe asthmatic mice. Intervention of MBD2 expression lead to a negative change of SOCS3 expression, whereas the differentiation of Th17 cells showed positive change. In addition, MBD2 knockout (MBD2-KO) mice displayed increased SOCS3 expression and decreased Th17 differentiation after severe asthma modeling. Taken together, our results suggest that MBD2 might facilitate Th17 cell differentiation via down-regulating SOCS3 expression in severe asthma. These findings uncover new roles for SOCS3 and MBD2, and provide a potential target for treatment of severe asthma.

Abstract: The Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), belonging to a member of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family, is involved in regulating neural development. However, the role of RKIP in microglial cells stimulated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) has not been determined. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the role of RKIP and its underlying mechanism in Parkinson's disease (PD). Our results showed that the expression of RKIP was significantly reduced in BV-2 cells treated with MPP+. Overexpression of RKIP markedly rescued cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis in BV-2 cells exposed to MPP+. In addition, overexpression of RKIP inhibited MPP+-induced the production of pro-inflammatory molecules in BV-2 cells. Similar results were observed in primary microglial cells isolated from neonatal mice. Exploration of the underlying mechanisms of its action indicated that overexpression of RKIP prevented the activation of NF-κB and MEK/ERK pathways in MPP+-stimulated BV-2 cells. Taken together, these findings indicated that RKIP suppresses apoptosis and inflammation in MPP+-treated microglial cells through the inactivation of NF-κB and MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Thus, RKIP may be a promising target molecular involving in the pathogenesis of PD.

Abstract: When a cell migrates, the centrosome positions between the nucleus and the leading edge of migration via the microtubule system. The protein CrpF46 (centrosome-related protein F46) has a known role during mitosis and centrosome duplication. However, how CrpF46 efficiently regulates centrosome-related cell migration is unclear. Here, we report that knockdown of CrpF46 resulted in the disruption of microtubule arrangement, with impaired centrosomal reorientation, and slowed down cell migration. In cells that express low levels of CrpF46, stress fibers were weakened, which could be rescued by recovering Flag-CrpF46. We also found that CrpF46 interacted with non-muscle myosin high chain IIA (NMHC IIA) and that its three coiled-coil domains are pivotal for its binding to NMHC IIA. Additionally, analyses of phosphorylation of NMHC IIA and RLC (regulatory light chain) demonstrated that CrpF46 was associated with myosin IIA during filament formation. Indirect immunofluorescence images indicated that NM IIA filaments were inhibited when CrpF46 was under-expressed. Thus, CrpF46 regulates cell migration by centrosomal reorientation and altering the function of the actomyosin network by controlling specific phosphorylation of myosin.

Abstract: With their capability to self-renew and differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer a unique model to study aspects of human development in vitro. Directed differentiation towards mesendodermal lineages is a complex process, involving transition through a primitive streak (PS)-like stage. We have recently shown PS-like patterning from hPSCs into definitive endoderm, cardiac as well as presomitic mesoderm by only modulating the bulk cell density and the concentration of the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021, a potent activator of the WNT pathway. The patterning process is modulated by a complex paracrine network, whose identity and mechanistic consequences are poorly understood. To study the underlying dynamics, we here applied mathematical modeling based on ordinary differential equations. We compared time-course data of early hPSC differentiation to increasingly complex model structures with incremental numbers of paracrine factors. Model simulations suggest at least three paracrine factors being required to recapitulate the experimentally observed differentiation kinetics. Feedback mechanisms from both undifferentiated and differentiated cells turned out to be crucial. Evidence from double knock-down experiments and secreted protein enrichment allowed us to hypothesize on the identity of two of the three predicted factors. From a practical perspective, the mathematical model predicts optimal settings for directing lineage-specific differentiation. This opens new avenues for rational stem cell bioprocessing in more advanced culture systems, e.g. in perfusion-fed bioreactors enabling cell therapies.

Abstract: Endothelial dysfunction is a main feature of retinal neovascular diseases which are the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) participate in angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. Additionally, YAP can bind STAT3 in endothelial cells. In the study, dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) stimulated human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) was used as retinal endothelial hypoxia model. The proliferation of HRMECs, as well as t-YAP, p-STAT3 (Tyr705) increased, while p-YAP (Ser127), p-YAP (Ser397) decreased following hypoxia. Meanwhile, YAP and STAT3 translocated to the nucleus. YAP knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HRMECs. YAP overexpression up-regulated phosphorylation of STAT3. The YAP overexpression-induced HRMECs proliferation, migration and tube formation were reversed by S3I-201, a selective STAT3 inhibitor. YAP interacted with STAT3 to promote STAT3 nuclear translocation. Additionally, YAP and STAT3 promoted the transcription of VEGF synergistically. Finally, inhibition of YAP alleviated retinal pathological neovascularization in mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model. In summary, activated YAP interacted with STAT3 to promote the activation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, hence boosted the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HRMECs via VEGF signaling following hypoxia. The data will further elucidate the mechanisms of retinal neovascular diseases.

Abstract: Chemoresistance is one of the major barriers for tumor chemotherapy. It is clinically known that chemoresistance increases during tumor progression. Additionally, the extracellular matrix (ECM) is also remodeled during tumor progression. However, it remains unclear how ECM remodeling contributes to chemoresistance acquisition. Recently, it has been reported that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to chemoresistance acquisition. Here, how ECM remodeling contributes to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance acquisition was investigated from the viewpoints of EMT using in vitro ECM models mimicking native ECM in colorectal tumor tissue at three different malignant levels. 5-FU partially induced EMT and increased ABCB1 in colorectal HT-29 cells via TGF-β signaling (an invasive tumor cell model). When HT-29 cells were cultured on an ECM model (high malignant matrices) mimicking native ECM in highly malignant tumor tissues, the cells facilitated TGF-β-induced EMT and increased ABCB1 upregulation compared with that of other ECM models mimicking the low malignant level and normal tissues. High malignant matrices contained more chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains than those of other ECM models. Finally, CS chain-reduced high malignant matrices could not facilitate ABCB1 upregulation and TGF-β-induced EMT. These results demonstrated that ECM remodeling during tumor progression increased CS chains to facilitate EMT and ABCB1 upregulation, contributing to chemoresistance acquisition.

Abstract: Among different cancers, incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the highest. KRAS mutation is one of the underlying features in the pathogenesis of CRC with CRC tumors harboring mutant KRAS exhibiting a more aggressive behavior compared to CRC tumors with wild type KRAS. We had earlier shown that the microRNA-143 (miR-143) replenishment not only chemosensitizers CRC cell line with mutant KRAS instead of wild-type KRAS gene, to paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity, but also inhibits cell migration and invasion ability. Hence, the study aimed to determine how miR-143 replenishment is inhibiting pre-metastatic behavior in CRC cells with mutant KRAS. Top ten mRNA targets of miR-143 as predicted by TargetScan were evaluated by qRT-PCR in LoVo cells which were performed mock transfection or miR-143 mimic transfection. Evaluation of the changes in cognate mRNA target(s) was done in 30 paired CRC tissue and tumor adjacent normal tissue specimens and in LoVo cells by western blot. Effect of the mRNA target on pro-metastatic behavior was assayed by gain- and loss-of-function studies using a combination of western blotting and in vitro cell proliferation and transwell migration/invasion assay in LoVo cells and in the normal colonic epithelium cell line FHC. In vivo effect of the cognate mRNA target on CRC metastasis was assayed by xenograft assay. Of the 10 predicted mRNA targets, FOSL2 (P < 0.05) and IGFBP5 (P > 0.05) was down regulated in LoVo cells transfected with the miR-143 mimic. FOSL2 mRNA levels were significantly downregulated in CRC tissue specimens compared with adjacent normal tissue (P < 0.05). Immunoblot analysis showed that FOSL2, but not IGFBP5, protein expression is down regulated in LoVo cells after the miR-143 mimic transfection. FOSL2 overexpression in the normal colonic epithelial cell line FHC or siRNA-mediated silencing in LoVo cells induced and repressed, respectively, pro-mesenchymal cell features. Whereas manipulation of FOSL2 expression did not have any effect on cell proliferation rates, silencing its expression inhibited cell migration and invasion ability in vitro. In addition, silencing of FOSL2 expression in the LoVo cells can significantly inhibited invasion of hepatic, while no effect was found for tumorigenic potential. Our results suggest that FOSL2 is a critical regulator of CRC metastasis and might be an important marker for prognostic in CRC patients.

Abstract: miRNAs regulate gene expression and enable clinicians to distinguish between benign and malignant tissues in cancers. PH domain leucine-rich repeat-containing protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) is known to be a tumour suppressor. A lentiviral overexpression system was used to stably express miR-190, leading to the enhancement of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proliferation and metastasis as a result of inhibited PHLPP1 expression. The results showed that stable miR-190 expression increased the expression of EMT-related proteins (Snail and TCF8/ZEB1) as well as the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and the expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1 (ADAMTS1). However, restoring PHLPP1 expression counteracted the effects of miR-190 on HCC proliferation, migration and invasion. The results of the animal experiments showed that miR-190 improved the HepG2 cell tumour formation and lung metastasis ability. Stable miR-190 overexpression leads to the downregulation of PHLPP1 protein expression. miR-190 has potential as a target in the treatment and diagnosis of HCC.

Abstract: MiR-182–5p suppresses expression of Foxo1 that is a protective factor in renal disorders and is up-regulated in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Thus, we hypothesized that dys-function of miR-182–5p/Foxo1 axis contributed to development of lupus nephritis (LN). Firstly, we investigated the expressions of miR-182–5p and Foxo1 in LN patients and during growth of LN MRL/lpr mice. Then we subjected MRL/lpr mice to the injection of miR-182–5p antagomirs and assessed the effect of miR-182–5p inhibition on renal structure and function. In vitro, we administrated renal cell lines with TGF-β1 to explore the relation between renal fibrosis and miR-182–5p. The level of miR-182–5p was up-regulated in high Chronicity Index patients while the level of Foxo1 was suppressed. The progression of LN in mice was associated with the increased level of miR-182–5p and the decreased level of Foxo1. The inhibition of miR-182–5p ameliorated renal structure and function impairments associated with LN, along with the increased expression of Foxo1. The administration of TGF-β1 in vitro increased the expression of miR-182–5p in renal cells in an overall dose-dependent manner. The current study demonstrated that the expression of miR-182–5p was increased in LN patients, contributing to the suppression of Foxo1 and development of LN.

Abstract: Recently, SIRT5 was reported to be a predominant desuccinylase and demalonylase in mitochondria. Ablation of SIRT5 enhances the systemic succinylation and malonylation of mitochondrial proteins, including various metabolic enzymes; however, its function in pancreatic β cells has not yet been clarified. In this study, we evaluated the effects of SIRT5 overexpression on glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis in β cell lines. Full-length SIRT5, which preferentially targeted to mitochondria and partially to the nucleus and cytoplasm, was overexpressed in NIT-1 cells. Chronic exposure to excess palmitate and glucose (High-PA-G) induced apoptosis and suppressed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β cells. SIRT5 overexpression significantly alleviated apoptosis under the High-PA-G condition, accompanied by suppressed Caspase 3 activity and reduced malondialdehyde levels. SIRT5 overexpression also improved β cell secretory capacity in response to glucose under the High-PA-G condition, suggesting its protective role in β cell function. Furthermore, SIRT5 overexpression reversed the decreasing trend of anti-apoptotic factors BCL-2 and BCL-XL expression under High-PA-G condition. Further regulation mechanisms between SIRT5 and these anti-apoptotic factors remains to be explored in future studies. Our data reveal that SIRT5 is a potentially protective factor for pancreatic β cells against glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis and cell dysfunction.

Abstract: Heat-shock protein (Hsp) 27 is a major intracellular molecular chaperone and controller of intracellular responses to inflammatory signals. In the extracellular space, recombinant Hsp27 has been described to exert anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to assess the association between circulating levels of Hsp27 and different types of periodontitis. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and the stress proteins Hsp27 and Hsp60 with proposed anti- and pro-inflammatory properties, respectively, were measured by two-site ELISA in the serum of patients with aggressive periodontitis (AgP, n = 30), chronic periodontitis (CP, n = 29) and periodontally healthy controls (H, n = 28). Furthermore, Hsp27 and Hsp60 levels were also measured longitudinally in 12 AgP patients at 6 time points up to 3 months after treatment. AgP patients had lower levels of Hsp27 compared to CP patients and healthy subjects (adjusted one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001, followed by post hoc Tukey HSD comparisons), while no differences in levels of Hsp60 or cytokines between the three groups were detected. In CP patients and H subjects, the systemic Hsp27 levels correlated with Hsp60 (r = 0.43, p < 0.001; r = 0.59, p < 0.001, respectively) and with pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α (r = 0.48, p < 0.001; r = 0.55, p < 0.001, respectively) and IL-6 (r = 0.44, p < 0.01). However, no such correlations were detected in AgP cases. No consistent temporal patterns of changes of Hsp27 concentration were detected across AgP patients following periodontal treatment. This study provides the first evidence that Hsp27 may be differentially expressed and regulated in AgP patients as compared with CP patients and healthy individuals.

Abstract: This work investigated the effect of a 6-day heat acclimation (HA) protocol on myotube metabolic responses at baseline and in response to a subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. C2C12 myotubes were incubated for 2 h/day at 40°C for 6 days (HA) or maintained at 37°C (C). Following 24-h recovery, myotubes were challenged with 500 ng/ml LPS for 2 h, then collected for analysis of protein markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and macronutrient storage. Functional significance of these changes was confirmed with mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic measurements on a Seahorse XF-96 analyzer. HA stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis and increased indicators of mitochondrial content [SIRT1 (+ 62%); PGC-1α (+ 57%); NRF-1 (+ 40%); TFAM (+ 141%); CS (+ 25%); CytC (+ 38%); all p < 0.05]. Altered lipid biosynthesis enzymes [p-ACCa:ACC (+ 59%; p = 0.04) and FAS (− 86%; p < 0.01)] suggest fatty acid generation may have been downregulated, whereas increased GLUT4 (+ 69%; p < 0.01) and LDH-B (+ 366%; p < 0.01) suggest aerobic glycolytic capacity may have been improved. Mitochondrial biogenesis signaling in HA myotubes was suppressed by 500 ng/ml LPS (PGC-1α, NRF-1, TFAM; all p > 0.05) but increased LDH-B (+ 30%; p = 0.02) and CPT-1 (+ 55%; p < 0.01) suggesting improved catabolic function. Basal respiration was increased in HA myotubes (+ 8%; p < 0.01) and HA myotubes maintained elevated basal respiration during LPS challenge (+ 8%; p < 0.01). LPS reduced peak respiration in C myotubes (− 6%; p < 0.01) but did not impair peak respiration in HA myotubes (p > 0.05). Oxidative reliance was elevated in HA over that in control (+ 25%; p < 0.01) and in HA + LPS over C + LPS (+ 30%; p < 0.01). In summary, HA stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis in C2C12 myotubes. HA myotubes exhibited (1) elevated basal/peak mitochondrial respiration capacities; (2) greater oxidative reliance; and (3) protection against LPS-mediated respiration impairment. Collectively, these data suggest HA may improve aerobic metabolism in skeletal muscle and protect against LPS-mediated energy deficit.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common female malignant tumors in the world. It seriously affects women's physical and mental health and the leading cause of cancer death among women. Our previous study demonstrated that diet-derived IFN-γ promoted the malignant transformation of primary bovine mammary epithelial cells by accelerating arginine depletion. The current study aimed to explore whether arginine addition could inhibit the degree of malignant transformation and its molecular mechanism. The results indicate that arginine addition could alleviate the malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells induced by IFN-γ, including reducing cell proliferation, cell migration and colony formation, through the NF-κB-GCN2/eIF2α pathway. The in vivo experiments also consistently confirmed that arginine supplementation could significantly inhibit tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, the investigation of the clinical data also revealed that the plasma or tissue from human breast cancer patients owned lower arginine level and higher IFN-γ level than that from patients with benign breast disease, showing IFN-γ may be a potential control target. Our findings demonstrate that arginine supplement could antagonize the malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells induced by IFN-γ (nutritionally induced) both in vitro and in vivo, and IFN-γ was higher in breast cancer women. This might provide a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer regarding to nutrition.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related macular degeneration is caused by dysfunction and loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, and their transplantation may rescue visual functions and delay disease progression. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) may be an unlimited source of RPE cells for allotransplantation. We analyzed the immunomodulatory properties of hESC-derived RPE (hESC-RPE) cells, and showed that they inhibited T cell responses. Co-culture experiments showed that RPE cells inhibited interfon-γ secretion and proliferation of activated T cells. Furthermore, hESC-RPE cells enhanced T cell apoptosis and secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). In addition, RPE cells altered the expression of T cell activation markers, CD69 and CD25. RPE cells transplanted into RCS rats without immunosuppression survived, provided retinal rescue, and enhanced IL-10 blood levels. Our data suggest that hESC-RPE cells have immunosuppressive properties. Further studies will determine if these properties are sufficient to alleviate the need for immunosuppression therapy after their clinical allotransplantation.

Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly malignant cancer with poor prognosis. Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) may play an important role in tumor progression. Our present study aimed to explore the effect of LncRNA SOX2OT on GC progression. We observed that SOX2OT was overexpressed in GC tissues and cell lines. Overexpressed SOX2OT promoted cell proliferation and metastasis of GC cells (SGC-7901, TMK-1) and the phosphorylation of AKT2 as well, while knockdown of SOX2OT reversed these effects. Besides that, miR-194-5p was predicted to be a target of SOX2OT and decreased expression of miR-194-5p was observed in GC tissues and cell lines. Overexpressed miR-194-5p counteracted the promoting role of SOX2OT on cell proliferation and invasion of GC cells. Moreover, AKT2 was predicted to be a target of miR-194-5p. The expression of AKT2 was negatively regulated by miR-194-5p while positively regulated by SOX2OT. Overexpressed AKT2 also promoted GC cell proliferation and invasion. Our in vitro experiments suggested that SOX2OT promoted cell proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via sponging miR-194-5p from AKT2. Finally, our in vivo experiments indicated that overexpressed SOX2OT promoted GC tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice. Taken together, our present study suggested that SOX2OT contributed to GC progression via sponging miR-194-5p from AKT2 both in vitro and in vivo. The SOX2OT-miR-194-5p-AKT2 axis may provide a new perspective for treatment of GC.

Abstract: Summary
The largest diversity of neural lineages generated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) occurs early after birth and is regulated in a spatiotemporal manner depending on the expression of specific transcriptional cues. Transcriptomics and fate-mapping approaches were employed to explore the relationship between regional expression of transcription factors by neural stem cells (NSCs) and the specification of distinct neural lineages. Our results support an early priming of NSCs for the genesis of defined cell types depending on their spatial location in the SVZ and identify HOPX as a marker of a subpopulation primed toward astrocytic fates. Manipulation of HOPX expression, however, showed no effect on astrogenesis but resulted in marked changes in the number of NSCs and of their progenies. Taken together, our results highlight transcriptional and spatial heterogeneity of postnatal NSCs and reveal a key role for HOPX in controlling SVZ germinal activity.

Abstract: Animal cells divide by a process called cytokinesis which relies on the constriction of a contractile actomyosin ring leading to the production of two daughter cells. Cytokinesis is an intrinsic property of cells which occurs even for artificially isolated cells. During division, isolated cells undergo dramatic changes in shape such as rounding and membrane deformation as the division furrow ingresses. However, cells are often embedded in tissues and thus are surrounded by neighbouring cells. How these neighbours might influence, or might themselves be influenced by, the shape changes of cytokinesis is poorly understood in vertebrates. Here, we show that during cytokinesis of epithelial cells in the Xenopus embryo, lateral cell-cell contacts remain almost perpendicular to the epithelial plane. Depletion of the tight junction-associated protein GEF-H1 leads to a transient and stereotyped deformation of cell-cell contacts. Although, this deformation occurs only during cytokinesis, we show that it originates from immediate neighbours of the dividing cell. Moreover, we show that exocyst and recycling endosome regulation by GEF-H1 are involved in adaptation of cell-cell contacts to deformation. Our results highlight the crucial role of tight junctions and GEF-H1 in cell-cell contact adaptation when cells are exposed to a mechanical stress such as cytokinesis.

Abstract: Summary
Fluorescent VEGF-A isoforms have been evaluated for their ability to discriminate between VEGFR2 and NRP1 in real-time ligand binding studies in live cells using BRET. To enable this, we synthesized single-site (N-terminal cysteine) labeled versions of VEGF165a, VEGF165b, and VEGF121a. These were used in combination with N-terminal NanoLuc-tagged VEGFR2 or NRP1 to evaluate the selectivity of VEGF isoforms for these two membrane proteins. All fluorescent VEGF-A isoforms displayed high affinity for VEGFR2. Only VEGF165a-TMR bound to NanoLuc-NRP1 with a similar high affinity (4.4 nM). Competition NRP1 binding experiments yielded a rank order of potency of VEGF165a > VEGF189a > VEGF145a. VEGF165b, VEGF-Ax, VEGF121a, and VEGF111a were unable to bind to NRP1. There were marked differences in the kinetic binding profiles of VEGF165a-TMR for NRP1 and VEGFR2. These data emphasize the importance of the kinetic aspects of ligand binding to VEGFR2 and its co-receptors in the dynamics of VEGF signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Sexual transmission of filoviruses was first reported in 1968 after an outbreak of Marburg virus (MARV) disease and recently caused flare-ups of Ebola virus disease in the 2013–2016 outbreak. How filoviruses establish testicular persistence and are shed in semen remain unknown. We discovered that persistent MARV infection of seminiferous tubules, an immune-privileged site that harbors sperm production, is a relatively common event in crab-eating macaques that survived infection after antiviral treatment. Persistence triggers severe testicular damage, including spermatogenic cell depletion and inflammatory cell invasion. MARV mainly persists in Sertoli cells, leading to breakdown of the blood-testis barrier formed by inter-Sertoli cell tight junctions. This disruption is accompanied by local infiltration of immunosuppressive CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Our study elucidates cellular events associated with testicular persistence that may promote sexual transmission of filoviruses and suggests that targeting immunosuppression may be warranted to clear filovirus persistence in damaged immune-privileged sites.

Abstract: Summary
CrAssphages represent the most abundant virus in the human gut microbiota, but the lack of available genome sequences for comparison has kept them enigmatic. Recently, sequence-based classification of distantly related crAss-like phages from multiple environments was reported, leading to a proposed familial-level taxonomic group. Here, we assembled the metagenomic sequencing reads from 702 human fecal virome/phageome samples and analyzed 99 complete circular crAss-like phage genomes and 150 contigs ≥70 kb. In silico comparative genomics and taxonomic analysis enabled a classification scheme of crAss-like phages from human fecal microbiomes into four candidate subfamilies composed of ten candidate genera. Laboratory analysis was performed on fecal samples from an individual harboring seven distinct crAss-like phages. We achieved crAss-like phage propagation in ex vivo human fecal fermentations and visualized short-tailed podoviruses by electron microscopy. Mass spectrometry of a crAss-like phage capsid protein could be linked to metagenomic sequencing data, confirming crAss-like phage structural annotations.

Abstract: Summary
Tauopathies such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remain incurable to date, partially due to the lack of translational in vitro disease models. The MAPT gene, encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau, has been shown to play an important role in FTD pathogenesis. Therefore, we used zinc finger nucleases to introduce two MAPT mutations into healthy donor induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The IVS10+16 mutation increases the expression of 4R tau, while the P301S mutation is pro-aggregant. Whole-transcriptome analysis of MAPT IVS10+16 neurons reveals neuronal subtype differences, reduced neural progenitor proliferation potential, and aberrant WNT/SHH signaling. Notably, these neurodevelopmental phenotypes could be recapitulated in neurons from patients carrying the MAPT IVS10+16 mutation. Moreover, the additional pro-aggregant P301S mutation revealed additional phenotypes, such as an increased calcium burst frequency, reduced lysosomal acidity, tau oligomerization, and neurodegeneration. This series of iPSCs could serve as a platform to unravel a potential link between pathogenic 4R tau and FTD.

Abstract: An essential aspect of stem cell in vitro culture and in vivo therapy is achieving sustained levels of growth factors to support stem cell survival and expansion, while maintaining their multipotency and differentiation potential. This study investigated the ability of dextrin (~74,000 g/mol; 27.8 mol% succinoylation) conjugated to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; or FGF-2) (3.9 and 6.7% w/w protein loading, respectively) to support the expansion and differentiation of stem cells in vitro via sustained, controllable growth factor release. Supplementation of mouse neural stem cells (mNSCs) with dextrin-growth factor conjugates led to greater and prolonged proliferation compared to unbound EGF/bFGF controls, with no detectable apoptosis after 7 days of treatment. Immunocytochemical detection of neural precursor (nestin) and differentiation (Olig2, MAP2, GFAP) markers verified that controlled release of dextrin-conjugated growth factors preserves stem cell properties of mNSCs for up to 7 days. These results show the potential of dextrin-growth factor conjugates for localized delivery of bioactive therapeutic agents to support stem cell expansion and differentiation, and as an adjunct to direct neuronal repair.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 integration into the host genome favors actively transcribed genes. Prior work indicated that the nuclear periphery provides the architectural basis for integration site selection, with viral capsid-binding host cofactor CPSF6 and viral integrase-binding cofactor LEDGF/p75 contributing to selection of individual sites. Here, by investigating the early phase of infection, we determine that HIV-1 traffics throughout the nucleus for integration. CPSF6-capsid interactions allow the virus to bypass peripheral heterochromatin and penetrate the nuclear structure for integration. Loss of interaction with CPSF6 dramatically alters virus localization toward the nuclear periphery and integration into transcriptionally repressed lamina-associated heterochromatin, while loss of LEDGF/p75 does not significantly affect intranuclear HIV-1 localization. Thus, CPSF6 serves as a master regulator of HIV-1 intranuclear localization by trafficking viral preintegration complexes away from heterochromatin at the periphery toward gene-dense chromosomal regions within the nuclear interior.

Abstract: Several studies have suggested that bone marrow stromal steam cells (BMSC) exist in a quiescent state (G0) within the in vivo niche; however, an explicit analysis of the biology of G0 state-BMSC has not been reported. We hypothesized that induction of G0 in BMSC might enhance their stem cell properties. Thus, we induced quiescence in BMSC in vitro by (a) suspension culture in a viscous medium or (b) culture on soft polyacrylamide substrate; and examined their molecular and functional phenotype. Induction of G0 was confirmed by bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling and analysis of cell cycle gene expression. Upon reactivation and re-entry into cell cycle, G0 state-BMSC exhibited enhanced clonogenic self-renewal, preferential differentiation into osteoblastic rather than adipocytic cells and increased ectopic bone formation when implanted subcutaneously in vivo in immune-deficient mice, compared to asynchronous proliferating (pre-G0) BMSC. Global gene expression profiling revealed reprogramming of the transcriptome during G0 state including significant alterations in relevant pathways and expression of secreted factors, suggesting altered autocrine and paracrine signaling by G0 state-BMSC and a possible mechanism for enhanced bone formation. G0 state-BMSC might provide a clinically relevant model for understanding the in vivo biology of BMSC.

Abstract: When analyzing small stress proteins of rat and human tissues by electrophoretic methods followed by western blotting, and using the anti-HspB1/anti-HspB5 antibody clone 8A7, we unexpectedly found a protein with a molecular mass of ~44 kDa. On two-dimensional gels, this protein resolved into four distinct species. Electrophoretic and immunological evidence suggests that this 44 kDa protein is a derivative of HspB5, most likely a covalently linked HspB5 dimer. This HspB5-like 44 kDa protein (HspB5L-P44) is particularly abundant in rat heart, brain, and renal cortex and glomeruli. HspB5L-P44 was also found in human brains, including those from patients with Alexander disease, a condition distinguished by cerebral accumulation of HspB5. Gray matter of such a patient contained an elevated amount of HspB5L-P44. A spatial model of structurally ordered dimeric HspB5 α-crystallin domains reveals the exposed and adjacent position of the two peptide segments homologous to the HspB1-derived 8A7 antigen determinant peptide (epitope). This explains the observed extraordinary high avidity of the 8A7 antibody towards HspB5L-P44, as opposed to commonly used HspB5-specific antibodies which recognize other epitopes. This scenario also explains the remarkable fact that no previous study reported the existence of HspB5L-P44 species. Exposure of rat endothelial cells to UV light, an oxidative stress condition, temporarily increased HspB5L-P44, suggesting physiological regulation of the dimerization. The existence of HspB5L-P44 supports the protein speciation discourse and fits to the concept of the protein code, according to which the expression of a given gene is reflected only by the complete set of the derived protein species.

Abstract: Differentiation-dependent expression of NOSTRIN in murine trophoblast cells prompted investigation on NOSTRIN's function in trophoblast differentiation. We show here that NOSTRIN levels increased in both mouse and rat placenta during gestation. NOSTRIN expression was not co-related to expression of eNOS precluding its eNOS mediated function. NOSTRIN transcripts were identified in trophoblast cells of the placenta, predominantly in trophoblast giant cells (TGC). Precocious over-expression of NOSTRIN during differentiation of trophoblast stem cells led to up-regulation of genetic markers associated with invasion (Prl4a1, Prl2a1) and TGC formation (Prl2c2, Prl3d1, Prl3b1). The functional consequence of NOSTRIN over-expression was increased TGC formation and trophoblast cell invasion. Furthermore, number of polyploid TGCs that arise by endoreduplication, were higher in presence of NOSTRIN. Early induction of NOSTRIN was associated with substantial decrease in G/F actin ratio and augmentation of N-WASP-Dynamin-NOSTRIN ternary complex formation that might be partially responsible for nucleation of actin filaments. NOSTRIN also formed a complex with Cdk1 and increased phosphorylation of T14 and Y15 residues that inhibits cytokinesis. Interestingly, SH3 domain deleted NOSTRIN was ineffective in eliciting NOSTRIN's function in differentiating trophoblast cells. These findings demonstrate that NOSTRIN potentiates trophoblast differentiation towards TGC trajectory that is critical for hemochorial placentation.

Abstract: Free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFA1) and FFA4 mediate a variety of biological responses through binding of medium- and long-chain free fatty acids. The aim of this study was to investigate an involvement of FFA1 and FFA4 in the regulation of cellular functions during tumor progression in colon cancer cells. The long-term fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CDDP) treated cells were generated from DLD1 cells (DLD-5FU and DLD-CDDP cells, respectively). FFAR1 expressions were lower in DLD-5FU and DLD-CDDP cells than in DLD1 cells. In contrast, DLD-5FU and DLD-CDDP cells showed the high FFAR4 expressions, compared with DLD1 cells. The cell motile activities of DLD-5FU and DLD-CDDP cells were reduced by GW9508 which is an agonist of FFA1 and FFA4. Moreover, GW1100, an antagonist of FFA1, inhibited the cell motile activities of DLD-5FU and DLD-CDDP cells. To evaluate whether FFA1 and FFA4 regulate the enhancement of cell motility, invasion and colony formation, highly migratory (hmDLD1) cells were established from DLD1 cells. FFAR1 expression was significantly higher in hmDLD1 cells than in DLD1 cells, but no change of FFAR4 expression was observed. The elevated cell motile and invasive activities and colony formation of hmDLD1 cells were suppressed by FFA1 inhibition. These results suggest that FFA1 and FFA4 are involved in the regulation of cellular functions during tumor progression in colon cancer DLD1 cells.

Abstract: Ketamine, an FDA-approved N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is commonly used for general pediatric anesthesia. Accumulating evidence has indicated that prolonged exposure to ketamine induces widespread apoptotic cell death in the developing brains of experimental animals. Although mitochondria are known to play a pivotal role in cell death, little is known about the alterations in mitochondrial ultrastructure that occur during ketamine-induced neurotoxicity. The objective of this pilot study was to utilize classic and contemporary methods in electron microscopy to study the impact of ketamine on the structure of mitochondria in the developing rat brain. While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to comprehensively study mitochondrial inner membrane topology, serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) was used as a complementary technique to compare the overall mitochondrial morphology from a representative treated and untreated neuron. In this study, postnatal day 7 (PND-7) Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with ketamine or saline (6 subcutaneous injections × 20 mg/kg or 10 ml/kg, respectively, at 2-h intervals with a 6-h withdrawal period after the last injection, n=6 each group). Samples from the frontal cortex were harvested and analyzed using TEM or SBF-SEM. While classic TEM revealed that repeated ketamine exposure induces significant mitochondrial swelling in neurons, the newer technique of SBF-SEM confirmed the mitochondrial swelling in three dimensions (3D) and showed that ketamine exposure may also induce mitochondrial fission, which was not observable in the two dimensions (2D) of TEM. Furthermore, 3D statistical analysis of these reconstructed mitochondria appeared to show that ketamine-treated mitochondria had significantly larger volumes per unit surface area than mitochondria from the untreated neuron. The ultrastructural mitochondrial alterations demonstrated here by TEM and SBF-SEM support ketamine’s proposed mechanism of neurotoxicity in the developing rat brain.

Abstract: Summary
Secretory proteins translocate across the mammalian ER membrane co-translationally via the ribosome-sec61 translocation machinery. Signal sequences within the polypeptide, which guide this event, are diverse in their hydrophobicity, charge, length, and amino acid composition. Despite the known sequence diversity in the ER signals, it is generally assumed that they have a dominant role in determining co-translational targeting and translocation process. We have analyzed co-translational events experienced by secretory proteins carrying efficient versus inefficient signal sequencing, using an assay based on Xbp1 peptide-mediated translational arrest. With this method we were able to measure the functional efficiency of ER signal sequences. We show that an efficient signal sequence experiences a two-phase event whereby the nascent chain is pulled from the ribosome during its translocation, thus resuming translation and yielding full-length products. Conversely, the inefficient signal sequence experiences a single weaker pulling event, suggesting inadequate engagement by the translocation machinery of these marginally hydrophobic signal sequences.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a dynamic organelle, plays an essential role in organizing the signaling pathways involved in cellular adaptation, resilience, and survival. Impairment in the functions of ER occurs in a variety of nutritive disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Here, we hypothesize that (scopoletin) SPL, a coumarin, has the potential to alleviate ER stress induced in vitro and in vivo models by lipotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, the ability of SPL to restore the levels of proteins of ER stress was analyzed. Rat insulinoma 5f (RIN5f) cells and Sprague Dawley rats were the models used for this study. Groups of control and high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFFD)-fed rats were treated with either SPL or 4-phenylbutyric acid. Status of ER stress was enumerated by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical studies. Proximal proteins of ER stress inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) were reduced in the β-cells by SPL. The subsequent signaling proteins X-box binding protein 1, eukaryotic initiation factor2α, activating transcription factor 4, and C/EBP homologous protein were also suppressed in their expression levels when treated with SPL. IRE1, PERK signaling leads to c-Jun-N-terminal kinases phosphorylation, a kinase that interrupts insulin signaling, which was also reverted upon scopoletin treatment. Finally, we confirm that SPL has the ability to suppress the stress proteins and limit pancreatic ER stress which might help in delaying the progression of insulin resistance.

Abstract: The introduction and widespread adoption of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has opened new avenues for craniofacial regenerative medicine. Neural crest cells (NCCs) are the precursor population to many craniofacial structures, including dental and periodontal structures, and iPSC-derived NCCs may, in the near future, offer an unlimited supply of patient-specific cells for craniofacial repair interventions. Here, we used an established protocol involving simultaneous Wnt signaling activation and TGF-β signaling inhibition to differentiate three human iPSC lines to cranial NCCs. We then derived a mesenchymal progenitor cell (NCC-MPCs) population with chondrogenic and osteogenic potential from cranial NCCs and investigated their similarity to widely studied human postnatal dental or periodontal stem/progenitor cells. NCC-MPCs were quite distinct from both their precursor cells (NCCs) and bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal cells, a stromal population of mesodermal origin. Despite their similarity with dental stem/progenitor cells, NCC-MPCs were clearly differentiated by a core set of 43 genes, including ACKR3 (CXCR7), whose expression (both at transcript and protein level) appear to be specific to NCC-MPCs. Altogether, our data demonstrate the feasibility of craniofacial mesenchymal progenitor derivation from human iPSCs through a neural crest-intermediate and set the foundation for future studies regarding their full differentiation repertoire and their in vivo existence.

Abstract: Many cell types respond to electric fields (EFs) through cell migration, a process termed galvanotaxis. The galvanotactic response is critical for development and wound healing. Here we investigate whether skin-derived precursor cells (SKPs), which have the potential to differentiate into mesodermal and peripheral neural cell types, undergo directed migration in the presence of an EF. We found that EF application promotes SKP migration towards the anode. The migratory response is substrate-dependent as SKPs undergo directed migration on laminin and Matrigel, but not collagen. The majority of SKPs express the undifferentiated cell markers nestin, fibronectin and Sox2, after both EF application and in sister cultures with no EF application, suggesting that EFs do not promote cell differentiation. Co-cultures of SKPs and brain-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs), a population of cells that undergo rapid, cathode-directed migration, reveal that in the presence of NPCs an increased percentage of SKPs undergo galvanotaxis, providing evidence that cells can provide cues to modify the galvanotactic response. We propose that a better understanding of SKP migration in the presence of EFs may provide insight into improved strategies for wound repair.

Abstract: Summary
Reactivation of mutant p53 has emerged as a promising approach for cancer therapy. Recent studies have identified several mutant p53-reactivating compounds that target thiol groups in mutant p53. Here we have investigated the relationship between thiol reactivity, p53 thermostabilization, mutant p53 refolding, mutant p53-dependent growth suppression, and induction of cell death. Analysis of the National Cancer Institute database revealed that Michael acceptors show the highest selectivity for mutant p53-expressing cells among analyzed thiol-reactive compounds. Further experimental testing demonstrated that Michael acceptors, aldehydes, imines, and primary alcohols can promote thermodynamic stabilization of mutant p53. Moreover, mild thiol reactivity, often coupled with combined chemical functional groups, such as in imines, aldehydes, and primary alcohols, can stimulate mutant p53 refolding. However, strong electrophile activity was associated with cellular toxicity. Our findings may open possibilities for rational design of novel potent and selective mutant p53-reactivating compounds.

Abstract: Summary
Cartilage pellets generated from ectomesenchymal progeny of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro eventually show signs of commitment of chondrocytes to hypertrophic differentiation. When transplanted subcutaneously, most of the surviving pellets were fully mineralized by 8 weeks. In contrast, treatment with the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, in vitro resulted in slightly enlarged cartilage pellets containing an increased proportion of proliferating immature chondrocytes that expressed very low levels of hypertrophic/terminally matured chondrocyte-specific genes. Forskolin treatment also enhanced hyaline cartilage formation by reducing type I collagen gene expression and increasing sulfated glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the developed cartilage. Chondrogenic mesoderm from hPSCs and dedifferentiated nasal chondrocytes responded similarly to forskolin. Furthermore, forskolin treatment in vitro increased the frequency at which the cartilage pellets maintained unmineralized chondrocytes after subcutaneous transplantation. Thus, the post-transplantational fate of chondrocytes originating from hPSC-derived chondroprogenitors can be controlled during their genesis in vitro.

Abstract: DESI2 is a novel pro-apoptotic gene. We previously reported that DESI2 overexpression induces S phase arrest and apoptosis by activating checkpoint kinases. This work was to test whether the combination of endostatin, an endogenous antiangiogenic inhibitor, with DESI2 could improve the therapy efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The recombinant plasmid co-expressing DESI2 and endostatin was encapsulated with DOTAP/Cholesterol cationic liposome. Mice bearing CT26 colon carcinoma and LL2 lung cancer were treated with the DNA-liposome complex. We found that, in vitro, the combination of DESI2 and endostatin more efficiently inhibited proliferation of CT26, LL2, HCT116 and A549 cancer cells via apoptosis, as assessed by MTT assay, colony-formation assays, flow cytometric analysis, hoechst staining and activation of caspase-3, respectively. In addition, DESI2 overexpression caused up-regulation of RPS7, a substrate of DESI2 deubiquitination. Furthermore, siRNA targeting RPS7 partially abrogated, whereas RPS7 overexpression enhanced DESI2-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. Importantly, the combination also caused DNA lesions accumulation, which further promotes apoptosis. Mechanistic rationale suggested that endostatin first inhibits DNA-PKcs kinase, and partly abrogated DESI2-induced phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, leading to increase of DNA damage, then contributes to DESI2-induced apoptosis. In vivo, the combined gene therapy more significantly inhibited tumor growth and efficiently prolonged the survival of tumor bearing mice than mono therapy. The improved antitumor effect was associated with inhibition of cell proliferation via apoptosis, as analyzed by TUNEL assay and PCNA immunostaining. The combination also inhibited angiogenesis, as assessed by alginate-encapsulated tumor cell assay and CD31 staining. Our data suggest that the combined gene therapy of DESI2 and endostatin can significantly enhance the antitumor activity as a DNA lesions accumulator, apoptosis inducer and angiogenesis inhibitor. The present study may provide a novel method for the treatment of cancer.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers such as beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) and monothiol glycerol (MTG) are extensively used in stem cell research to prevent cellular oxidative stress. However, how these antioxidant supplements impact stem cell cardiac differentiation, a process regulated by redox-signaling remains unknown. In this study, we found that removal of BME from the conventional high-glucose, serum-based differentiation medium improved cardiac differentiation efficiency by 2-3 fold. BME and MTG treatments during differentiation significantly reduced mRNA expression of cardiac progenitor markers (NKX2.5 and ISL1) as well as sarcomeric markers (MLC2A, MLC2V, TNNI3, MYH6 and MYH7), suggesting reduced cardiomyogenesis by BME or MTG. Moreover, BME and MTG altered the expression ratios between the sarcomeric isoforms. In particular, TNNI3 to TNNI1 ratio and MLC2V to MLC2A ratio were significantly lower in BME or MTG treated cells than untreated cells, implying altered cardiomyocyte phenotype and maturity. Lastly, BME and MTG treatments resulted in less frequent beating, slower contraction and relaxation velocities than untreated cells. Interestingly, none of the above-mentioned effects was observed with Trolox, a non-thiol based antioxidant, despite its strong antioxidant activity. This work demonstrates that commonly used antioxidant supplements may cause considerable changes to cellular redox state and the outcome of differentiation.

Abstract: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are activated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and function as mesenchymal cells in liver regeneration. Activated HSCs also have proangiogenic ability in vivo. In this study, knockin of the TGF-β1 gene caused mHSCs to transform into myofibroblasts (MFs) highly expressing Jagged1 and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). These MFs promoted formation of capillary-like structures by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro, which was much reduced after blocking TGF-β1 signaling. Transplantation of TGF-β1-knockin mHSCs was followed by efficient engraftment into livers and accompanied by increased vascular organization and expression of Jagged1 and VEGFA compared with controls. Less hepatic angiogenesis and lower Jagged1 and VEGFA expression, was found in livers engrafted with TGF-β-R1-knockdown mHSCs. Increased vascularization improved liver function. The findings showed that mHSCs were regulated by TGF-β1 signaling to express Jagged1 and VEGFA, which were associated with hepatic angiogenesis, a novel mechanism of mHSC promotion of new vascular structures.

Abstract: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive cellular response that aims to relieve endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via several mechanisms, including inhibition of protein synthesis and enhancement of protein folding and degradation. There is a controversy over the effect of the UPR on ER protein export. While some investigators suggested that ER export is inhibited during ER stress, others suggested the opposite. In this article, their conflicting studies are analyzed and compared in attempt to solve this controversy. The UPR appears indeed to enhance ER export, possibly via multiple mechanisms. However, another factor, which is the integrity of the folding machinery/environment inside ER, determines whether ER export will appear increased or decreased during experimentation. Also, different methods of stress induction appear to have different effects on ER export. Thus, improvement of ER export may represent a new mechanism by which the UPR alleviates ER stress. This may help researchers to understand how the UPR works inside cells and how to manipulate it to alter cell fate during stress, either to promote cell survival or death. This may open up new approaches for the treatment of ER stress-related diseases.

Abstract: Neural stem cells are emerging as a regenerative therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI), since they differentiate into functional neural cells and secrete beneficial paracrine factors into the damaged microenvironment. Previously, we successfully isolated and cultured adult human multipotent neural cells (ahMNCs) from the temporal lobes of epileptic patients. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy and treatment mechanism of ahMNCs for SCI using rodent models. When 1 × 106 ahMNCs were transplanted into injured spinal cords at 7 days after contusion, the injection group showed significantly better functional recovery than the control group (media injection after contusion), which was determined by the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) score. Although transplanted ahMNCs disappeared continuously, remained cells expressed differentiated neural cell markers (Tuj1) or astrocyte marker (GFAP) in the injured spinal cords. Moreover, the number of CD31-positive microvessels significantly increased in the injection group than that of the control group. The paracrine pro-angiogenic activities of ahMNCs were confirmed by in vitro tube formation assay and in vivo Matrigel plug assay. Together, these results indicate that ahMNCs have significant therapeutic efficacy in SCI via replacement of damaged neural cells and pro-angiogenic effects on the microenvironment of SCI.

Role of α-Dystrobrevin in the differentiation process of HL-60 cells,

Abstract: The α-Dystrobrevin gene encodes at least five different protein isoforms, expressed in diverse tissues. The α-Dystrobrevin-1 isoform (α-Db-1) is a member of the cytoplasmic dystrophin-associated protein complex, which has a C-terminal extension comprising at least three tyrosine residues susceptible to phosphorylation in vivo. We previously described α-Db in stem-progenitor cells and blood neutrophils as playing a scaffolding role and, in association with kinesin and microtubules, α-Db promotes platelet-granule trafficking. Additionally, the microtubules must establish a balanced interaction with the lamina A/C network for appropriate nuclear morphology. Considering that the most outstanding feature during neutrophil differentiation is nuclei lobulation, we hypothesized that α-Db might possess a pivotal function during the neutrophil differentiation process. Western Blot (WB) and confocal microscope assays evidenced a differential pattern expression and a subcellular redistribution of α-Db in neutrophils derived from HL-60 cells. At the end of the differentiation process, we detected an important diminution in the expression of tubulin, kinesin, and α-Db-1. Knockdown of α-Db prevented nuclei lobulation, increased Lamin A/C and syne1 expression and augmented the roughness of derived neutrophil membrane and disturbed filopodia assembly. Our results suggest that HL-60 cells undergo extensive cytoskeletal reorganization including α-Db in order to possess lobulated nuclei when they further differentiate into neutrophils.

Abstract: Micronuclei are extra-nuclear bodies containing whole chromosomes that were not incorporated into the nucleus after cell division or damaged chromosome fragments. Even though the link between micronuclei and DNA damage is described for a long time, little is known about the functional organization of micronuclei and their contribution to tumorigenesis. We showed fusions between micronuclear membranes and lysosomes by electron microscopy and linked lysosome function to DNA damage levels in micronuclei. In addition, micronuclei drastically differ from primary nuclei in nuclear envelope composition, with a significant increase in the relative amount of nuclear envelope proteins LBR and emerin and a decrease in nuclear pore proteins. Strikingly, micronuclei lack active proteasomes, as the processing subunits and other factors of the ubiquitin proteasome system. Moreover, micronuclear chromatin shows a higher degree of compaction as compared to primary nuclei. The specific aberrations identified in micronuclei and the potential functional consequences of these defects may contribute to the role of micronuclei in catastrophic genomic rearrangements.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) display heterogeneous expression of pluripotency factors such as Nanog when cultured with serum and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In contrast, dual inhibition of the signaling kinases GSK3 and MEK (2i) converts ESC cultures into a state with more uniform and high Nanog expression. However, it is so far unclear whether 2i acts through an inductive or selective mechanism. Here, we use continuous time-lapse imaging to quantify the dynamics of death, proliferation, and Nanog expression in mouse ESCs after 2i addition. We show that 2i has a dual effect: it both leads to increased cell death of Nanog low ESCs (selective effect) and induces and maintains high Nanog levels (inductive effect) in single ESCs. Genetic manipulation further showed that presence of NANOG protein is important for cell viability in 2i medium. This demonstrates complex Nanog-dependent effects of 2i treatment on ESC cultures.

Abstract: Summary
In developing organisms, proper tuning of the number of stem cells within a niche is critical for the maintenance of adult tissues; however, the involved mechanisms remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Thickveins (Tkv), a type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, acts in the Drosophila developing ovarian soma through a Smad-independent pathway to shape the distribution of BMP signal within the niche, impacting germline stem cell (GSC) recruitment and maintenance. Somatic Tkv promotes Egfr signaling to silence transcription of Dally, which localizes BMP signals on the cell surface. In parallel, Tkv promotes Hh signaling, which promotes escort cell cellular protrusions and upregulates expression of the Drosophila BMP homolog, Dpp, forming a positive feedback loop that enhances Tkv signaling and strengthens the niche boundary. Our results reveal a role for non-canonical BMP signaling in the soma during GSC establishment and generally illustrate how complex, cell-specific BMP signaling mediates niche-stem cell interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop in the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region and subsequently relocate to fetal liver. Runx1 transcription factor is essential for HSC development, but is largely dispensable for adult HSCs. Here, we studied tamoxifen-inducible Runx1 inactivation in vivo. Induction at pre-liver stages (up to embryonic day 10.5) reduced erythromyeloid progenitor numbers, but surprisingly did not block the appearance of Runx1-null HSCs in liver. By contrast, ex vivo analysis showed an absolute Runx1 dependency of HSC development in the AGM region. We found that, contrary to current beliefs, significant Cre-inducing tamoxifen activity persists in mouse blood for at least 72 hr after injection. This deferred recombination can hit healthy HSCs, which escaped early Runx1 ablation and result in appearance of Runx1-null HSCs in liver. Such extended recombination activity in vivo is a potential source of misinterpretation, particularly in analysis of dynamic developmental processes during embryogenesis.

Abstract: Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small fraction of a tumor mass, are proposed to be highly crucial for cancer initiation, recurrence and metastasis. We have recently found that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1A3 is a CSC marker in some thyroid cancer cell lines, whose functional activity is, however, not relevant for thyroid cancer stemness. Since previous studies on malignancies in other organs suggest that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) might be a functional and targetable CSC marker, the present study was conducted to elucidate the significance of ROS as a functional CSC marker in thyroid cancer cell lines. We first found that ROS levels controlled spherogenicity; that is, ROSlow cells were more spherogenic than ROShigh cells. However, unlike typical CSCs in other cancers, CSC-like ROSlow cells in thyroid cancer cells were plastic and were not accompanied by de-differentiation status (i.e., expression of stemness markers/thyroid-specific transcription factors) or chemo-/radio-resistance. The lower levels of ROS were functionally critical because a forced increase in ROS levels by L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, and irradiation suppressed spherogenicity. ROS levels were also correlated with the number of double strand DNA breaks determined by 53BP1 staining. Lower ROS levels appear to be a result of decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and elevated GSH contents. Given the importance of CSC-targeted therapy for achieving long-term disease eradication by exhausting self-renewal and growth potential of cancer tissues, ROS may be a good candidate for CSC-targeted therapy in thyroid cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Two principal stem cell pools orchestrate the rapid cell turnover in the intestinal epithelium. Rapidly cycling Lgr5+ stem cells are intercalated between the Paneth cells at the crypt base (CBCs) and injury-resistant reserve stem cells reside above the crypt base. The intermediate filament Keratin 15 (Krt15) marks either stem cells or long-lived progenitor cells that contribute to tissue repair in the hair follicle or the esophageal epithelium. Herein, we demonstrate that Krt15 labels long-lived and multipotent cells in the small intestinal crypt by lineage tracing. Krt15+ crypt cells display self-renewal potential in vivo and in 3D organoid cultures. Krt15+ crypt cells are resistant to high-dose radiation and contribute to epithelial regeneration following injury. Notably, loss of the tumor suppressor Apc in Krt15+ cells leads to adenoma and adenocarcinoma formation. These results indicate that Krt15 marks long-lived, multipotent, and injury-resistant crypt cells that may function as a cell of origin in intestinal cancer.

Abstract: Regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1) is an evolutionarily conserved, ubiquitous protein that responds to various cell stresses. Studies have proved REDD1 is involved in many diseases, such as osteoarthritis and cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of REDD1 in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Analysis of clinical tissue samples showed REDD1 expression was up-regulated during IDD and was correlated with the grade of disc degeneration. Overexpression of REDD1 in normal human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells resulted in extracellular matrix (ECM) degeneration. Further, we investigated the function of REDD1 using a serum deprivation-induced IDD vitro model and found that REDD1 was up-regulated in a temporal manner. However, hypoxia abolished this increase through down-regulation of NF-κB. Knockdown of REDD1 or NF-κB by si-RNA significantly rescued ECM from degeneration both in normoxia and hypoxia. In addition, NF-κB/REDD1 mediated the protection of hypoxia from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis and autophagy in NP cells. These results suggest that REDD1 might play a pivotal role in IDD pathogenesis, thereby potentially providing a new therapeutic target for IDD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are central in orchestrating the clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris during inflammation, with the mechanism(s) regulating this process remaining of interest. Herein, we found that the n-3 docosapentaenoic acid-derived protectin (PDn-3 DPA) biosynthetic pathway regulated the differentiation of human monocytes, altering macrophage phenotype, efferocytosis, and bacterial phagocytosis. Using lipid mediator profiling, human primary cells and recombinant enzymes we found that human 15-lipoxygenases initiate the PDn-3 DPA pathway catalyzing the formation of an allylic epoxide. The complete stereochemistry of this epoxide was determined using stereocontrolled total organic synthesis as 16S,17S-epoxy-7Z,10Z,12E,14E,19Z-docosapentaenoic acid (16S,17S-ePDn-3 DPA). This intermediate was enzymatically converted by epoxide hydrolases to PD1n-3 DPA and PD2n-3 DPA, with epoxide hydrolase 2 converting 16S,17S-ePDn-3 DPA to PD2n-3 DPA in human monocytes. Taken together these results establish the PDn-3 DPA biosynthetic pathway in human monocytes and macrophages and its role in regulating macrophage resolution responses.

Pyroptosis occurs upon activation of proinflammatory caspases and their subsequent cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD), resulting in GSDMD N-terminal fragments that form membrane pores to induce cell lysis. Here, we show that antioxidant defense enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and its ability to decrease lipid peroxidation, negatively regulate macrophage pyroptosis, and septic lethality in mice. Conditional Gpx4 knockout in myeloid lineage cells increases lipid peroxidation-dependent caspase-11 activation and GSDMD cleavage. The resultant N-terminal GSDMD fragments then trigger macrophage pyroptotic cell death in a phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1)-dependent fashion. Administration of the antioxidant vitamin E that reduces lipid peroxidation, chemical inhibition of PLCG1, or genetic Caspase-11 deletion or Gsdmd inactivation prevents polymicrobial sepsis in Gpx4−/− mice. Collectively, this study suggests that lipid peroxidation drives GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and hence constitutes a potential therapeutic target for lethal infection.

Abstract: Summary
The polo kinase family are important oncology targets that act in regulating entry into and progression through mitosis. Structure-guided discovery of a new class of inhibitors of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) catalytic activity that interact with Cys67 of the ATP binding site is described. Compounds containing the benzothiazole N-oxide scaffold not only bind covalently to this residue, but are reversible inhibitors through the formation of Meisenheimer complexes. This mechanism of kinase inhibition results in compounds that can target PLK1 with high selectivity, while avoiding issues with irreversible covalent binding and interaction with other thiol-containing molecules in the cell. Due to renewed interest in covalent drugs and the plethora of potential drug targets, these represent prototypes for the design of kinase inhibitory compounds that achieve high specificity through covalent interaction and yet still bind reversibly to the ATP cleft, a strategy that could be applied to avoid issues with conventional covalent binders.

Abstract: Aims
Abundance of connexin 43 (Cx43), a transmembrane protein that forms hemichannels (HCs) and gap junctions (GJs), is dynamically regulated in human gingival fibroblasts (GFBLs) during wound healing. This may be important for fast and scarless gingival wound healing as Cx43 is involved in key cell functions important during this process. Our aim was to uncover the factors that regulate Cx43 expression and abundance in GFBLs. We hypothesized that cytokines and growth factors released during wound healing coordinately regulate Cx43 abundance in GFBLs.
Results
TGF-β1, -β2, -β3, PGE2 and IL-1β significantly upregulated, while TNF-α and IFN-γ downregulated Cx43 in cultured GFBLs. TGF-β1, -β2, -β3, IL-1β and IFN-γ modulated Cx43 abundance at both mRNA and protein levels, while TNF-α and PGE2 regulated only Cx43 protein abundance, suggesting involvement of distinct transcriptional/post-transcriptional and translational/post-translational mechanisms, respectively. TGF-β1-induced upregulation of Cx43 was mediated by TGFβRI (ALK5) and SMAD2/3 signaling, and this was potently suppressed by PGE2, IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ that inhibited SMAD2/3 phosphorylation.
Conclusion
Regulation of Cx43 abundance in GFBLs involves transcriptional/post-transcriptional and translational/post-translational mechanisms that are distinctly modulated by an interplay between TGF-β isoforms and PGE2, IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are key regulatory molecules that are implicated in diverse biological processes and human diseases, including preeclampsia. However, their expression and functions in the progression of preeclampsia remains largely unclear. In this study, lncRNA DLX6-AS1 was confirmed to be significantly upregulated in the placentas of patients with preeclampsia, compared with normal controls. Overexpression of DLX6-AS1 dramatically decreased proliferation, migration and invasion in trophoblast JEG3 and HTR-8/SVneo cells. Luciferase activity and RNA pull-down assays showed that DLX6-AS1 interacted with miR-376c, and that overexpression of DLX6-AS1 significantly reduced expression of miR-376c in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Also, miR-376c targeted and downregulated GADD45A in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Overexpression of GADD45A effectively attenuated a miR-376c-induced increase in the proliferation, migration and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Further research showed that DLX6-AS1-induced inhibition of trophoblast proliferation, migration and invasion was effectively neutralized by GADD45A knockdown and miR-376c overexpression. Taken together, these findings suggest that DLX6-AS1 may contribute to preeclampsia by impairing proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of trophoblasts via the miR-376c/GADD45A axis.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of the mother during pregnancy causes devastating Zika congenital syndrome in the offspring. A ZIKV vaccine with optimal safety and immunogenicity for use in pregnant women is critically needed. Toward this goal, we have developed a single-dose live-attenuated vaccine candidate that infects cells with controlled, limited infection rounds. The vaccine contains a 9-amino-acid deletion in the viral capsid protein and replicates to titers of > 106 focus-forming units (FFU)/mL in cells expressing the full-length capsid protein. Immunization of A129 mice with one dose (105 FFU) did not produce viremia, but elicited protective immunity that completely prevented viremia, morbidity, and mortality after challenge with an epidemic ZIKV strain (106 PFU). A single-dose vaccination also fully prevented infection of pregnant mice and maternal-to-fetal transmission. Intracranial injection of the vaccine (104 FFU) to 1-day-old mice did not cause any disease or death, underscoring the safety of this vaccine candidate.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the NPHS1 gene, which encodes NEPHRIN, cause congenital nephrotic syndrome, resulting from impaired slit diaphragm (SD) formation in glomerular podocytes. However, methods for SD reconstitution have been unavailable, thereby limiting studies in the field. In the present study, we established human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a patient with an NPHS1 missense mutation, and reproduced the SD formation process using iPSC-derived kidney organoids. The mutant NEPHRIN failed to become localized on the cell surface for pre-SD domain formation in the induced podocytes. Upon transplantation, the mutant podocytes developed foot processes, but exhibited impaired SD formation. Genetic correction of the single amino acid mutation restored NEPHRIN localization and phosphorylation, colocalization of other SD-associated proteins, and SD formation. Thus, these kidney organoids from patient-derived iPSCs identified SD abnormalities in the podocytes at the initial phase of congenital nephrotic disease.

Abstract: Currently, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) is being investigated as an anti-cancer drug for tumors expressing the tight junction (TJ) transmembrane proteins claudin-3 and/or claudin-4. However, the optimal conditions for CPE cytotoxicity are still unclear. Our objectives were to determine the optimal conditions for CPE as an anti-cancer drug for treating ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. In our experiments, cells at low culture density showed higher sensitivity to CPE, suggesting that claudins at TJs were poorly accessible to CPE compared with those at the edge of cell colonies. Ovarian cancer cells cultured under calcium-depleted pretreatment conditions to disrupt TJs and to knock-down TJ proteins and E-cadherin production altered CPE cytotoxicity, which was mainly dependent on claudin-4 expression. These results suggest that the condition of claudin-4 at the cell surface is important for CPE cytotoxicity. Our in vivo experiments showed that a high dose of CPE is required for the effective treatment of peritoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer cells. Here, we suggest that the accessibility of CPE to claudins is important for its cytotoxicity and depends on the conditions of claudin-4 in vitro. In addition, E-cadherin expression in ovarian cancer cells affects the efficiency of CPE in vivo.

Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection increases the risk of developing severe liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As microRNAs may modulate host – virus interactions, we here investigated if hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection modulate microRNA expression using an in vitro HepG2 cell model system with inducible HBV replication. We found that HBV replication was associated with upregulation of miR-192-5p, miR-194-5p and miR-215-5p, of which miR-192-5p and miR-215-5p have identical seed sequences. Bioinformatics analyses revealed a significant enrichment of potential target genes involved in apoptosis signaling of all three microRNAs. In line with this, transfection with a mimic of miR-192-5p suppressed the protein level of pro-apoptotic BIM and reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. In contrast, transfection with a mimic of miR-194-5p downregulated the anti-apoptotic proteins SODD and cFLIP, and sensitized HepG2 cells to both ER stress- and cytokine-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our study suggests that HBV upregulates the expression of miR-192-5p and miR-194-5p in the host cell. These microRNAs target important apoptosis-regulatory proteins, and may thus contribute to the development of HBV-related liver disease.

Abstract: Summary
To facilitate understanding of human cardiomyocyte (CM) subtype specification, and the study of ventricular CM biology in particular, we developed a broadly applicable strategy for enrichment of ventricular cardiomyocytes (VCMs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). A bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic H9 hESC line in which GFP expression was driven by the human ventricular-specific myosin light chain 2 (MYL2) promoter was generated, and screened to identify cell-surface markers specific for MYL2-GFP-expressing VCMs. A CD77+/CD200− cell-surface signature facilitated isolation of >97% cardiac troponin I-positive cells from H9 hESC differentiation cultures, with 65% expressing MYL2-GFP. This study provides a tool for VCM enrichment when using some, but not all, human pluripotent stem cell lines. Tools generated in this study can be utilized toward understanding CM subtype specification, and enriching for VCMs for therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Chemoradiation is an established approach in the treatment of advanced oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC), but therapy may cause severe side-effects due to signal interchanges between carcinoma and the tumour microenvironment (TME). In this study, we examined the potential use of our human 3D myoma disc and Myogel models in in vitro chemoradiation studies by analysing the effects of ionizing radiation (IR) and the combined effect of heparanase I (HPSE1) inhibitors and IR on OTSCC cell proliferation, invasion and MMP-2 and − 9 production. Finally, we analysed the long-term effects of IR by studying clones of previously irradiated and invaded HSC-3 cells. We found that in both human uterine leiomyoma-based extracellular matrix models IR inhibited the invasion of HSC-3 cells, but blocking HPSE1 activity combined with IR induced their invasion. Low doses of IR increased MMP expression and initiated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cells cultured on myoma discs. We conclude that myoma models offer consistent methods for testing human carcinoma cell invasion and phenotypic changes during chemoradiation treatment. In addition, we showed that IR had long-term effects on MMP-2 and − 9, which might elicit different HSC-3 invasion responses when cells were under the challenge of HPSE1 inhibitors and IR.

Abstract: Summary
Apart from their antimicrobial properties, tetracyclines demonstrate clinically validated effects in the amelioration of pathological inflammation and human cancer. Delineation of the target(s) and mechanism(s) responsible for these effects, however, has remained elusive. Here, employing quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified human 80S ribosomes as targets of the tetracyclines Col-3 and doxycycline. We then developed in-cell click selective crosslinking with RNA sequence profiling (icCL-seq) to map binding sites for these tetracyclines on key human rRNA substructures at nucleotide resolution. Importantly, we found that structurally and phenotypically variant tetracycline analogs could chemically discriminate these rRNA binding sites. We also found that tetracyclines both subtly modify human ribosomal translation and selectively activate the cellular integrated stress response (ISR). Together, the data reveal that targeting of specific rRNA substructures, activation of the ISR, and inhibition of translation are correlated with the anti-proliferative properties of tetracyclines in human cancer cell lines.

Abstract: Summary
Colonic wound repair is an orchestrated process, beginning with barrier re-establishment and followed by wound channel formation and crypt regeneration. Elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promote barrier re-establishment; however, we found that persistently elevated PGE2 hinders subsequent repair phases. The bacterial metabolite deoxycholate (DCA) promotes transition through repair phases via PGE2 regulation. During barrier re-establishment, DCA levels are locally diminished in the wound, allowing enhanced PGE2 production and barrier re-establishment. However, during transition to the wound channel formation phase, DCA levels increase to inhibit PGE2 production and promote crypt regeneration. Altering DCA levels via antibiotic treatment enhances PGE2 levels but impairs wound repair, which is rescued with DCA treatment. DCA acts via its receptor, farnesoid X receptor, to inhibit the enzyme cPLA2 required for PGE2 synthesis. Thus, colonic wound repair requires temporally regulated signals from microbial metabolites to coordinate host-associated signaling cascades.

Abstract: Summary
Mast cells are tissue-resident immune cells. Their overgrowth/overactivation results in a range of common distressing, sometimes life-threatening disorders, including asthma, psoriasis, anaphylaxis, and mastocytosis. Currently, drug discovery is hampered by use of cancer-derived mast cell lines or primary cells. Cell lines provide low numbers of mature mast cells and are not representative of in vivo mast cells. Mast cell generation from blood/bone marrow gives poor reproducibility, requiring 8–12 weeks of culture. Here we report a method for the rapid/robust production of mast cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). An advantageous Gata2Venus reporter enriches mast cells and progenitors as they differentiate from PSCs. Highly proliferative mouse mast cells and progenitors emerge after 2 weeks. This method is applicable for rapid human mast cell generation, and could enable the production of sufficient numbers of physiologically relevant human mast cells from patient induced PSCs for the study of mast cell-associated disorders and drug discovery.

Abstract: Fibronectin (Fn) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) multifunctional glycoprotein essential for regulating cells behaviors. Within ECM, Fn is found as polymerized fibrils. Apart from fibrils, Fn could also form other kind of supramolecular assemblies such as aggregates. To gain insight into the impact of Fn aggregates on cell behavior, we generated several Fn oligomeric assemblies. These assemblies displayed various amyloid-like properties but were not cytotoxic. In presence of the more amyloid-like structured assemblies of Fn, the cell-ECM networks were altered and the cell shapes shifted toward extended mesenchymal morphologies. Additionnaly, the Fn amyloid-like aggregates promoted a single-cell and sparsed migration of SKOV3 cancer cells, which was associated with a relocalization of αv integrins from plasma membrane to perinuclear vesicles. These data pointed out that the features of supramolecular Fn assemblies could represent a higher level of fine-tuning cell phenotype, and especially migration of cancer cells.

Protein kinase C mediated internalization of ErbB2 is independent of clathrin, ubiquitination and Hsp90 dissociation,

Abstract: Overexpression of ErbB2 is frequent in cancer and understanding the mechanisms which regulate its expression is important. ErbB2 is considered endocytosis resistant. It has no identified ligand, but upon heterodimerization it is a potent mediator of proliferative signaling. A recent study established a role for protein kinase C (PKC) in internalization and recycling of ErbB2. We have now further investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in PKC-mediated downregulation of ErbB2. We confirm that PMA-induced PKC activation causes ErbB2 internalization, but while the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG induced ErbB2 degradation, PMA had no such effect. When combined with 17-AAG, PMA had additive effect on ErbB2 internalization indicating that Hsp90 inhibition and PKC activation induce internalization by alternative mechanisms. We confirm that while 17-AAG-induced internalization was clathrin-mediated, PMA-induced internalization was clathrin independent. This difference may be explained by while both 17-AAG and PMA reduced the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2, only 17-AAG induced Hsp90 dissociation, Hsp70 recruitment and ubiquitination of ErbB2. Importantly, since PMA induced internalization of ErbB2, but not dissociation of Hsp90, Hsp90 does not per se retain ErbB2 at the plasma membrane. The morphology of the compartment into which receptors are sorted upon PKC activation has not previously been identified. By immuno-electron microscopy, we show that PMA sorts ErbB2 into a complex tubulovesicular or cisternal organelle resembling a previously described endocytic recycling compartment.

Abstract: The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain is a predominant animal model of type 1 diabetes. However, this mouse strain is considered to be non-permissive for embryonic stem cell (ESC) derivation using conventional methods. We examined small molecule inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) to block spontaneous cell differentiation and promote pluripotency persistence. Here we show a single pharmacological GSK3 inhibitor, 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime (BIO), in combination with leukemia inhibition factor (LIF), promoted generation of stable NOD ESC lines at >80% efficiency. Significantly, expansion of the established NOD ESC lines no longer required treatment with BIO. These NOD ESC lines contributed to chimeric mice and transmitted to germline progeny that spontaneously developed diabetes. By contrast, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AZA), a small molecule inhibitor of DNA methylation, and trichostatin A (TSA) and valproic acid (VPA), small molecule inhibitors of histone deacetylase, could not promote generation of NOD ESCs by epigenetic remodeling. These combined findings provide strategic insights for imposing pluripotency in cells isolated from a non-permissive strain.

Abstract: Ninety percent of all cancer related deaths happen due to metastatic progression. One important protein facilitating metastatic progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the metastasis associated 1 protein (MTA-1). We have earlier shown that in the context of HCC and normal liver cell lines, HuH6 and THLE-2, respectively. MTA-1 protein is actively stabilized in HCC cell lines and actively degraded in normal liver cells. We had also shown that TRIM25 is the E3 ligase that interacts with and degrades MTA-1 protein in normal liver cells. However, the exact mechanism by which TRIM25 degrades MTA-1 protein has still not been elucidated. In the study, we used both in situ prediction algorithms and mass spectrometry based post-translational modification analysis to map the lysine residues in MTA-1 that are polyubiquitinated. Whereas UbPred algorithm revealed a combination of medium and low confidence sites, it revealed only one high confidence lysine (K98) residue. The hCKSAAP_UbSite algorithm also predicted K98 site. Mass spectrometry analysis also showed that K98 has ubiquitin modification. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that in normal liver cell line, THLE-2, which has high expression of TRIM25, ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged wild-type MTA-1 was actively degraded, but the K98R mutant MTA-1 was not. In vitro ubiquitination assay using recombinant wild-type and K98R mutant MTA-1 confirmed that MTA-1 is poly-ubiquitinated at K98 residue by TRIM25. The K98R mutant had a longer half-life than wild-type MTA-1 protein in an in vitro protein stability assay. We establish that TRIM25 ubiquitinates MTA-1 at lysine 98 and degrades it normal liver cells.

Abstract: Tumor hypoxia is associated with several features of aggressive glioma growth, including migration, invasion, and stemness. Most of the cellular adaptation to hypoxia is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α, but regulation of these factors by both oxygen-dependent and –independent mechanisms in brain tumors is only partially understood. Here, we show that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is stabilized at hypoxia in murine glioma in vivo, as well as in primary human glioma cultures in vitro. Expression of p75NTR resulted in increased stabilization of HIF-1α and HIF-2α, and RNAi or pharmacologic targeting of p75NTR diminished HIF stabilization and HIF-dependent signaling at hypoxia. Consequentially, p75NTR inhibition resulted in decreased migration, invasion, and stemness in response to hypoxia, suggesting that p75NTR is a central regulator of hypoxia-induced glioma aggressiveness. Together, our findings support the literature that identifies p75NTR as a potential therapeutic target in brain tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The morphogen FGF8 plays a pivotal role in neocortical area patterning through its inhibitory effect on COUP-TFI/Nr2f1 anterior expression, but its mechanism of action is poorly understood. We established an in vitro model of mouse embryonic stem cell corticogenesis in which COUP-TFI protein expression is inhibited by the activation of FGF8 in a time window corresponding to cortical area patterning. Interestingly, overexpression of the COUP-TFI 3′UTR reduces the inhibitory effect of FGF8 on COUP-TFI translation. FGF8 induces the expression of few miRNAs targeting COUP-TFI 3′UTR in silico. We found that the functional inhibition of miR-21 can effectively counteract the inhibitory effect of FGF8 in vitro and regulate COUP-TFI protein levels in vivo. Accordingly, miR-21 expression is complementary to COUP-TFI expression during corticogenesis. These data support a translational control of COUP-TFI gradient expression by FGF8 via miR-21 and contribute to our understanding of how regionalized expression is established during neocortical area mapping.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) represent the most promising clinical source for regenerative medicine. However, given the cellular heterogeneity within cultivation and safety concerns, the development of specific and efficient tools to isolate a pure population and eliminate all residual undifferentiated PSCs from differentiated derivatives is a prerequisite for clinical applications. In this study, we raised a monoclonal antibody and identified its target antigen as desmoglein-2 (DSG2). DSG2 co-localized with human PSC (hPSC)-specific cell surface markers, and its expression was rapidly downregulated upon differentiation. The depletion of DSG2 markedly decreased hPSC proliferation and pluripotency marker expression. In addition, DSG2-negative population in hPSCs exhibited a notable suppression in embryonic body and teratoma formation. The actions of DSG2 in regulating the self-renewal and pluripotency of hPSCs were predominantly exerted through the regulation of β-catenin/Slug-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our results demonstrate that DSG2 is a valuable PSC surface marker that is essential for the maintenance of PSC self-renewal.

Abstract: An increase in tumour formation and metastasis are observed upon plakophilin3 (PKP3) loss. To identify pathways downstream of PKP3 loss that are required for increased tumour formation, a gene expression analysis was performed, which demonstrated that the expression of lipocalin2 (LCN2) was elevated upon PKP3 loss and this is consistent with expression data from human tumour samples suggesting that PKP3 loss correlates with an increase in LCN2 expression. PKP3 loss leads to an increase in invasion, tumour formation and metastasis and these phenotypes were dependent on the increase in LCN2 expression. The increased LCN2 expression was due to an increase in the activation of p38 MAPK in the HCT116 derived PKP3 knockdown clones as LCN2 expression decreased upon inhibition of p38 MAPK. The phosphorylated active form of p38 MAPK is translocated to the nucleus upon PKP3 loss and is dependent on complex formation between p38 MAPK and PKP3. WT PKP3 inhibits LCN2 reporter activity in PKP3 knockdown cells but a PKP3 mutant that fails to form a complex with p38 MAPK cannot suppress LCN2 promoter activity. Further, LCN2 expression is decreased upon loss of p38β, but not p38α, in the PKP3 knockdown cells. These results suggest that PKP3 loss leads to an increase in the nuclear translocation of p38 MAPK and p38β MAPK is required for the increase in LCN2 expression.

Abstract: Summary
It is highly desirable to specify human developmental principles in an appropriate human model with advanced genetic tools. However, genetically engineering human cells with lineage-tracing systems has not been achieved. Here we introduce strategies to construct lineage-tracing systems in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The AAVS1 locus was suitable for the integration of the conditional reporter. The Cre-LoxP and Flp-FRT systems were highly sensitive, which may cause inaccurate lineage labeling in human cells. The recombination sensitivity and tracing fidelity could be finely tuned by modification of the LoxP recombination site. Moreover, tamoxifen-controllable CreERT2-LoxP and FlpERT2-FRT systems showed compelling advantages in tightly tracing human lineages temporally. In proof-of-principle experiments, we traced human PAX6+ neuroectoderm cells and revealed their full neural lineage differentiation potency both in vitro and in vivo. Devising and optimizing of lineage-tracing systems in hESCs will thus set up a solid foundation for human developmental studies.

Abstract: High fat diet (HFD) decreases the lifespan of mice, and is a risk factor for several human diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of a HFD on lung epithelial and stem cells and its interaction with aging. Young and old mice were fed with either a standard diet (SD) or a HFD then their trachea and lung were examined for histological changes, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. Their stem cell function was examined using the in vitro organoid/colony forming efficiency (CFE) assay. Aging reduced the number of tracheal basal and alveolar type-2 (AT2) cells. HFD significantly increased the number of AT2 cells. Aging also caused a significant increase in lung inflammation, and HFD caused a similar increase, in young mice. Aging reduced mitochondrial mass and function, and increased reactive oxygen species. In young mice, HFD caused mitochondrial changes similar to the aging-induced changes. Organoid culture of tracheal and lung epithelial cells collected from both young and old HFD-fed mice showed higher CFE compared to SD-fed mice. Switching the HFD to low calorie/fat diet (LCD) efficiently reversed several of the HFD-induced effects. Thus, HFD induces several histological, inflammatory, and functional changes in the lung, and exacerbates the aging-induced lung inflammation and mitochondrial deterioration. LCD can reverse many of the HFD-induced effects.

Abstract: ETS-domain containing protein (Elk1), which is a transcription factor, is reported to be closely related to the apoptosis of primary neurons and could be activated by hypoxia in human microvascular endothelial cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of Elk1 in cortical neurons under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. The OGD model of cortical neurons was established the anoxia/hypoglycemia-induced injury and the in vivo model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Elk1 mRNA and protein expression was significantly up-regulated in neurons exposed to OGD for 24 h, and mRNA expression was also markedly increased in cerebral cortex of rats with MCAO after 10 days. The knockdown of Elk1 in neurons without OGD obviously constrained Fra-1 and promoted Nrf2 expression. Also, Elk1 inhibition suppressed neuronal apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, LDH leakage, and MDA and SOD contents, while it increased cell viability in the neurons with OGD. The overexpression of Fra-1 showed a reverse effect on caspase-3 activity, cell viability and SOD contents in neurons under OGD conditions compared with Elk1 knockdown. Thus, Elk1 inhibition has a protective effect on neurons against OGD-induced injury.

Abstract: Notch signaling functions in diverse developmental and homeostatic processes, including stem cell self-renewal and cell fate determination. Notch1-inactivating mutations are frequently detected in skin and oro-esophageal cancers, suggesting a role for Notch1 as a tumor suppressor. Here, we clarify the contribution of Notch1 deficiency to oro-esophageal tumorigenesis using a physiological experimental model. Tongue and esophageal tumors induced in mice by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) showed pathophysiological similarities to human tumors, including decreased Notch1 expression in the basal cells. We created mutant mice (N1cKO), in which the Notch1 gene was disrupted specifically in the squamous epithelium. The epithelium formed normally in N1cKO mice, and although multiple skin tumors were detected at 65 weeks, no tumors developed in the tongue and esophagus. However, 4-NQO-induced tumorigenesis assays revealed that tumor onset occurred earlier in N1cKO mice than in wild-type littermates, and the tumors arose preferentially from the Notch1-negative epithelium, indicating the tumor susceptibility of Notch1-deficient epithelium. Notch1 regulates the expression of TERT, and age-related telomere erosion was more rapid in Notch1-deficient basal cells. Our results indicated that although Notch1 deficiency had little effect on squamous epithelium formation, it predisposed the affected epithelium to tumor development, at least in part through accelerated telomere erosion.

Abstract: Summary
During reprogramming, telomere re-elongation is important for pluripotency acquisition and ensures the high quality of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), but the regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Our study showed that fully reprogrammed mature iPSCs or mouse embryonic stem cells expressed higher levels of miR-590-3p and miR-590-5p than pre-iPSCs. Ectopic expression of either miR-590-3p or miR-590-5p in pre-iPSCs improved telomere elongation and pluripotency. Activin receptor II A (Acvr2a) is the downstream target and mediates the function of miR-590. Downregulation of Acvr2a promoted telomere elongation and pluripotency. Overexpression of miR-590 or inhibition of ACTIVIN signaling increased telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (Terf1) expression. The p-SMAD2 showed increased binding to the Terf1 promoter in pre-iPSCs compared with mature iPSCs. Downregulation of Terf1 blocked miR-590- or shAcvr2a-mediated promotion of telomere elongation and pluripotency in pre-iPSCs. This study elucidated the role of the miR-590/Acvr2a/Terf1 signaling pathway in modulating telomere elongation and pluripotency in pre-iPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Tryptamine, a tryptophan-derived monoamine similar to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is produced by gut bacteria and is abundant in human and rodent feces. However, the physiologic effect of tryptamine in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract remains unknown. Here, we show that the biological effects of tryptamine are mediated through the 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) uniquely expressed in the colonic epithelium. Tryptamine increases both ionic flux across the colonic epithelium and fluid secretion in colonoids from germ-free (GF) and humanized (ex-GF colonized with human stool) mice, consistent with increased intestinal secretion. The secretory effect of tryptamine is dependent on 5-HT4R activation and is blocked by 5-HT4R antagonist and absent in 5-HT4R−/− mice. GF mice colonized by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron engineered to produce tryptamine exhibit accelerated GI transit. Our study demonstrates an aspect of host physiology under control of a bacterial metabolite that can be exploited as a therapeutic modality.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiation of astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is a tedious and variable process. This hampers the study of hPSC-generated astrocytes in disease processes and drug development. By using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inducible expression of NFIA or NFIA plus SOX9 in hPSCs, we developed a method to efficiently generate astrocytes in 4–7 weeks. The astrocytic identity of the induced cells was verified by their characteristic molecular and functional properties as well as after transplantation. Furthermore, we developed a strategy to generate region-specific astrocyte subtypes by combining differentiation of regional progenitors and transgenic induction of astrocytes. This simple and efficient method offers a new opportunity to study the fundamental biology of human astrocytes and their roles in disease processes.

Abstract: Summary
The development of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons is controlled by multiple morphogens and transcription factors. However, little is known about the role of extracellular matrix proteins in this process. Here we examined the function of roof plate-specific spondins (RSPO1-4) and the floor plate-specific, spondin 1 (SPON1). Only RSPO2 and SPON1 were expressed at high levels during mDA neurogenesis, and the receptor LGR5 was expressed by midbrain floor plate progenitors. Surprisingly, RSPO2, but not SPON1, specifically promoted the differentiation of mDA neuroblasts into mDA neurons in mouse primary cultures and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In addition, RSPO2 was found to promote not only mDA differentiation, but also mDA neurogenesis in human ESCs. Our results thus uncover an unexpected function of the matricellular protein RSPO2 and suggest an application to improve mDA neurogenesis and differentiation in human stem cell preparations destined to cell replacement therapy or drug discovery for Parkinson disease.

Abstract: Summary
O-GlcNAcylation is a reversible serine/threonine glycosylation for regulating protein activity and availability inside cells. In a given protein, O-GlcNAcylated and unoccupied O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) sites are referred to as closed and open sites, respectively. The balance between open and closed sites is believed to be dynamically regulated. In this report, closed sites are detected using in vitro incorporation of GalNAz by B3GALNT2, and open sites are detected by in vitro incorporation of GlcNAz by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), via click chemistry. For assessing total O-GlcNAc sites, a sample is O-GlcNAcylated in vitro by OGT before detecting by B3GALNT2. The methods are demonstrated on purified recombinant proteins including CK2, AKT1, and PFKFB3, and cellular extracts of HEK cells. Through O-GlcNAc imaging, the modification degree of O-GlcNAc in nuclei of Chinese hamster ovary cells was estimated. The detection and imaging of both open and closed O-GlcNAc sites provide a systematic approach to study this important post-translational modification.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 Env, a trimer of gp120-gp41 heterodimers, mediates membrane fusion after binding host receptor CD4. Receptor binding displaces V1V2 loops from Env's apex, allowing coreceptor binding and opening Env to enable gp41-mediated fusion. We present 3.54 Å and 4.06 Å cryoelectron microscopy structures of partially open soluble native-like Env trimers (SOSIPs) bound to CD4. One structure, a complex with a coreceptor-mimicking antibody that binds both CD4 and gp120, stabilizes the displaced V1V2 and reveals its structure. Comparing partially and fully open Envs with closed Envs shows that gp41 rearrangements are independent of the CD4-induced rearrangements that result in V1V2 displacement and formation of a 4-stranded bridging sheet. These findings suggest ordered conformational changes before coreceptor binding: (1) gp120 opening inducing side-chain rearrangements and a compact gp41 central helix conformation, and (2) 4-stranded bridging-sheet formation and V1V2 displacement. These analyses illuminate potential receptor-induced Env changes and inform design of therapeutics disrupting viral entry.

Abstract: Summary
The differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to hematopoietic lineages initiates with the specification of hemogenic endothelium, a transient specialized endothelial precursor of all blood cells. This in vitro system provides an invaluable model to dissect the emergence of hematopoiesis in humans. However, the study of hematopoiesis specification is hampered by a lack of consensus in the timing of hemogenic endothelium analysis and the full hematopoietic potential of this population. Here, our data reveal a sharp decline in the hemogenic potential of endothelium populations isolated over the course of hESC differentiation. Furthermore, by tracking the dynamic expression of CD31 and CD235a at the onset of hematopoiesis, we identified three populations of hematopoietic progenitors, representing primitive and definitive subsets that all emerge from the earliest specified hemogenic endothelium. Our data establish that hemogenic endothelium populations endowed with primitive and definitive hematopoietic potential are specified simultaneously from the mesoderm in differentiating hESCs.

Abstract: Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be a renewable source for generating cardiomyocyte (CM) for treating myocardial infraction. In our previous publication, we described an integrated microcarrier-based wave reactor process for the expansion and differentiation of hPSCs to CMs on a rocker based platform. However, this platform is limited in terms of linear scalability and CMs purity. The present study describes ways to overcome these limitations by the use of a stirred scalable platform and incorporation of an additional lactate based purification step which increases CM purity. Efficient CM differentiation in stirred spinners was achieved by (1) Addition of ascorbic acid (AS) during the differentiation phase which resulted in an increase of 38.42% in CM yield (0.84 ± 0.03 × 106vs 1.17 ± 0.07 × 106 CM/mL for cultures without AS and with AS respectively) and (2) Change of agitation regime to a shorter static intervals one (from 66 min off/6 min on (66/6) to 8 min off/1 min on (8/1)) during the first 3 days of differentiation which resulted in 22% increase in CM yield (1.50 ± 0.10 × 106vs 1.23 ± 0.07 × 106 CM/mL). The combination of AS addition and change in agitation regime resulted in a production yield of 1.50 ± 0.10 × 106 CM/mL which is comparable to that achieved in the rocker platform as described before (1.61 ± 0.36 × 106 CM/mL). Increase in CM purity was achieved by changing of culture medium to RPMI1640 (without glucose) + 5 mM lactate +0.6 mM AS at day 10 of differentiation which resulted in 44.5% increase in CM purity at day 15. The increase in purity of CMs was due to the death of the non-CM cells (~76% of cell death). It is important to note that in the absence of glucose, lactate was consumed at a rate of 0.01 mmol/106 cells/h. Addition of glucose, even in small amounts, during the purification step prevents the process of CM purification, due to the growth of the non-CM cell population. In summary, hPSC (hESC-HES3 and hiPSC-IMR90) can be efficiently differentiated to CMs in a scalable spinner process which integrates 7 days of expansion (3.01 ± 0.51 × 106 to 3.50 ± 0.65 × 106 cells/mL) followed by 10 days of WNT modulated CM differentiation and 5 days of lactate based purification. CM yield of 1.38 ± 0.22 × 106 to 1.29 ± 0.42 × 106 CM/mL with 72.5 ± 8.35% to 83.12 ± 8.73% cardiac troponin-T positive cells were obtained from these cultures.

Abstract: P277 is a 24 amino-acids peptide, residues 437–460 of human heat shock protein 60 (HSP60). P277 or sequence repeated 6 × P277 was previously found showing potency preventive and therapeutic anti-diabetes functions in NOD mice, but aroused atherosclerosis due to the induction of anti-HSP65 autoantibodies as reported. To determine the intrinsic B epitope sequence, we screened P277 with pepscan method and then proved by detection of sera IgG from peptide fragments vaccinated mouse and rabbits. Results indicated HSP60 443–448 (ALLRCI) is potential intrinsic B epitope sequence of P277. We modified P277 by deleting the former three amino acids of ALLRCI (VP) or replacing these six with alanine (AP). The detection of serum lipid parameter in NOD mice and aorta endothelial damage levels in high-cholesterol diets fed rabbits demonstrated that VP induced higher anti-diabetes efficacy and caused less arteriosclerosis-liked diseases separately. With less TLR2/4 activation of dendritic cells and macrophages, VP treatment reduced Th1 related P277 specific pro-inflammatory cytokines production and increased regulatory immune responses both in vivo and in vitro. These results indicated that optimized VP peptide might serve as a promising candidate for mouse type 1 diabetes therapy.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSC) are important in tissue homeostasis and regeneration due to their ability for self-renewal and multipotent differentiation. Differentiation, as well as proliferation, requires adaptations in the cell metabolism. However, only few data exist concerning the energy metabolism of non-differentiating and differentiating MSC. In this study we compared capacities of major energy metabolic pathways of MSC from human adipose tissue (adMSC) in vitro in the non-differentiated state with those of osteogenically or adipogenically differentiating adMSC. To this end we quantified the proliferation and differentiation status of adMSC and analyzed maximum enzyme capacities and several enzyme isoforms of major energy metabolic pathways regarding their activity and gene expression. We could show that non-differentiating and osteogenic cultivation conditions induced proliferation and showed increasing capacities of the glycolytic marker enzyme phosphofructokinase as well as the marker enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Adipogenic stimulation, which was accompanied by the absence of proliferation, reduced the glycolytic capacity (e.g. decreased glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase capacity) and induced an increase in mitochondrial enzyme capacities. These changes in energy metabolism might represent an adaptation of adMSC to the high energy demand during proliferation and to the specific cellular functions during osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Long-lived resting memory CD4+ T cells (TCM) are a major reservoir of latent HIV infection. We hypothesized that latent HIV-TCM cells are maintained by aberrant expression of cell survival factors, including XIAP, BIRC2/cIAP1, and beclin-1. DIABLO/SMAC mimetics are therapeutic agents that compromise cell survival by hijacking host apoptotic machinery. We found that DIABLO/SMAC mimetics (birinapant, GDC-0152, and embelin) selectively kill HIV-TCM without increasing virus production or targeting uninfected TCM. Treatment of HIV-TCM with DIABLO/SMAC mimetics promoted XIAP and BIRC2 degradation, which triggered autophagy and the formation of a cell death complex consisting of pro-apoptotic (FADD, RIPK1, RIPK3, and caspase 8) and autophagy (ATG5, ATG7, and SQSTM1) proteins. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of autophagy induction, but not autophagy-mediated degradation, abrogated this interaction and subsequent cell death. Our findings identify a mechanism whereby DIABLO/SMAC mimetics exploit autophagy and apoptotic machinery to selectively induce killing of HIV-TCM without viral reactivation while sparing uninfected cells.

Abstract: Summary
Kidney organoids made from pluripotent stem cells have the potential to revolutionize how kidney development, disease, and injury are studied. Current protocols are technically complex, suffer from poor reproducibility, and have high reagent costs that restrict scalability. To overcome some of these issues, we have established a simple, inexpensive, and robust method to grow kidney organoids in bulk from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Our organoids develop tubular structures by day 8 and show optimal tissue morphology at day 14. A comparison with fetal human kidneys suggests that day-14 organoid tissue most closely resembles late capillary loop stage nephrons. We show that deletion of HNF1B, a transcription factor linked to congenital kidney defects, interferes with tubulogenesis, validating our experimental system for studying renal developmental biology. Taken together, our protocol provides a fast, efficient, and cost-effective method for generating large quantities of human fetal kidney tissue, enabling the study of normal and aberrant kidney development.
