Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that are essential for cellular metabolism but can be functionally disrupted during pathogen infection. In neurons, mitochondria are transported on microtubules via the molecular motors kinesin-1 and dynein and recruited to energy-requiring regions such as synapses. Previous studies showed that proteins from pseudorabies virus (PRV), an alphaherpesvirus, localize to mitochondria and affect mitochondrial function. We show that PRV and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection of rodent superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons disrupts mitochondrial motility and morphology. During PRV infection, glycoprotein B (gB)-dependent fusion events result in electrical coupling of neurons and increased action potential firing rates. Consequently, intracellular [Ca2+] increases and alters mitochondrial dynamics through a mechanism involving the Ca2+-sensitive cellular protein Miro and reduced recruitment of kinesin-1 to mitochondria. This disruption in mitochondrial dynamics is required for efficient growth and spread of PRV, indicating that altered mitochondrial transport enhances alphaherpesvirus pathogenesis and infection.

Abstract: Malaria is caused by Plasmodium species, whose transmission to vertebrate hosts is facilitated by mosquito vectors. The transition from the cold blooded mosquito vector to the host represents physiological stress to the parasite, and additionally malaria blood stage infection is characterised by intense fever periods. In recent years, it has become clear that heat shock proteins play an essential role during the parasite's life cycle. Plasmodium falciparum expresses two prominent heat shock proteins: heat shock protein 70 (PfHsp70) and heat shock protein 90 (PfHsp90). Both of these proteins have been implicated in the development and pathogenesis of malaria. In eukaryotes, Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins are functionally linked by an essential adaptor protein known as the Hsp70–Hsp90 organising protein (Hop). In this study, recombinant P. falciparum Hop (PfHop) was heterologously produced in E. coli and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Using specific anti-PfHop antisera, the expression and localisation of PfHop in P. falciparum was investigated. PfHop was shown to co-localise with PfHsp70 and PfHsp90 in parasites at the trophozoite stage. Gel filtration and co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that PfHop was present in a complex together with PfHsp70 and PfHsp90. The association of PfHop with both PfHsp70 and PfHsp90 suggests that this protein may mediate the functional interaction between the two chaperones.

Abstract: Summary
Insects rely on innate immune responses controlled by the immune deficiency (IMD), Toll, and other immune signaling pathways to combat infection by a broad spectrum of pathogens. These pathways signal to downstream NF-κB family transcription factors that control specific antipathogen action via direct transcriptional control of immune effectors, hematopoiesis, and melanization. Here we show that in the Anopheles malaria vector, IMD and Toll pathways mediate species-specific defenses against Plasmodium and bacteria through the transcriptional regulation of splicing factors Caper and IRSF1 that, in turn, determine the production of pathogen-specific splice variant repertoires of the hypervariable pattern recognition receptor AgDscam. This mechanism represents an additional level of immune response regulation that may provide a previously unrecognized level of plasticity to the insect immune pathway-regulated antipathogen defenses.

Abstract: Deficiencies in brain orexins and components of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway have been reported in either human depression or animal model of depression. Brain administration of orexins affects behaviors toward improvement of depressive symptoms. However, the documentation of endogenous linkage between orexin receptor activation and MAPK signaling pathway remains to be insufficient. In this study, we report the effects of orexin 2 receptor (OX2R) activation on cell signaling in CHO cells over-expressing OX2R and in mouse hypothalamus cell line CLU172. Short-term extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and long-term cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation were subsequently observed in CHO cells that over-express OX2R while 20min of ERK phosphorylation was significantly detected in mouse adult hypothalamus neuron cell line CLU172. Orexin A, which can also activate OX2R, mediated ERK phosphorylation was as the same as orexin B in CHO cells. A MAPK inhibitor eliminated ERK phosphorylation but not CREB phosphorylation in CHO cells. Also, ERK and CREB phosphorylation was not mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) or calmodulin kinase (CaMK). However, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) by GF 109203X eliminated the phosphorylation of ERK and CREB in CHO cells. A significant decrease in ERK and CREB phosphorylation was observed with 1μM GF 109203X pre-treatment indicating that the conventional and novel isoforms of PKC are responsible for CREB phosphorylation after OX2R activation. In contrast, ERK phosphorylation induced by orexin B in CLU172 cells cannot be inhibited by 1μM of protein kinase C inhibitor. From above observation we conclude that OX2R activation by orexin B induces ERK and CREB phosphorylation and orexin A played the same role as orexin B. Several isoforms of PKC may be involved in prolonged CREB phosphorylation. Orexin B induced ERK phosphorylation in mouse hypothalamus neuron cells differs from CHO cell line and cannot be inhibited by PKC inhibitor GF 109203X. And hypothalamus neuron cells may use different downsteam pathway for orexin B induced ERK phosphorylation. This result supports findings that orexins might have anti-depressive roles.

Abstract: The capacity to follow cell type-specific signaling in intact lung remains limited. 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) is an endogenous fatty acid that mediates signaling for a number of key physiologic endpoints in the pulmonary vasculature, including cell survival and altered vascular tone. We used confocal microscopy to identify enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in endothelial cell (EC)s in intact lung evoked by two stable analogs of 20-HETE, 20-5,14-HEDE (20-hydroxyeicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoic acid) and 20-5,14-HEDGE (N-[20-hydroxyeicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoyl]glycine). These analogs generated increased ROS in cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells as well. 20-HETE analog treatment decreased apoptosis of pulmonary tissue exposed to hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) ex vivo. Enhanced ROS production and apoptosis were confirmed by biochemical assays. Our studies identify physiologically critical, graded ROS from ECs in live lung tissue ex vivo treated with 20-HETE analogs and protection from HR-induced apoptosis. These methodologies create exciting possibilities for studying signaling by stable 20-HETE analogs and other factors in pulmonary endothelial and other lung cell types in their native milieu.

Abstract: Summary
Bornaviruses are nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses that establish a persistent infection in the nucleus and occasionally integrate a DNA genome copy into the host chromosomal DNA. However, how these viruses achieve intranuclear infection remains unclear. We show that Borna disease virus (BDV), a mammalian bornavirus, closely associates with the cellular chromosome to ensure intranuclear infection. BDV generates viral factories within the nucleus using host chromatin as a scaffold. In addition, the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) interacts directly with the host chromosome throughout the cell cycle, using core histones as a docking platform. HMGB1, a host chromatin-remodeling DNA architectural protein, is required to stabilize RNP on chromosomes and for efficient BDV RNA transcription in the nucleus. During metaphase, the association of RNP with mitotic chromosomes allows the viral RNA to segregate into daughter cells and ensure persistent infection. Thus, bornaviruses likely evolved a chromosome-dependent life cycle to achieve stable intranuclear infection.

Abstract: The activation of transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1)/Smad signaling pathway and increased expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) induced by angiotensin II (AngII) have been proposed as a mechanism for atrial fibrosis. However, whether TGFβ1/non-Smad signaling pathways involved in AngII-induced fibrogenetic factor expression remained unknown. Recently tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6)/TGFβ-associated kinase 1 (TAK1) has been shown to be crucial for the activation of TGF-β1/non-Smad signaling pathways. In the present study, we explored the role of TGF-β1/TRAF6 pathway in AngII-induced CTGF expression in cultured adult atrial fibroblasts. AngII (1μM) provoked the activation of P38 mitogen activated protein kinase (P38 MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2(ERK1/2) and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK). AngII (1μM) also promoted TGFβ1, TRAF6, CTGF expression and TAK1 phosphorylation, which were suppressed by angiotensin type I receptor antagonist (Losartan) as well as p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB202190), ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) and JNK inhibitor (SP600125). Meanwhile, both TGFβ1 antibody and TRAF6 siRNA decreased the stimulatory effect of AngII on TRAF6, CTGF expression and TAK1 phosphorylation, which also attenuated AngII-induced atrial fibroblasts proliferation. In summary, the MAPKs/TGFβ1/TRAF6 pathway is an important signaling pathway in AngII-induced CTGF expression, and inhibition of TRAF6 may therefore represent a new target for reversing Ang II-induced atrial fibrosis.

Abstract: Suspension bioreactors are an attractive alternative to static culture of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) for the generation of clinically relevant cell numbers in a controlled system. In this study, we have developed a scalable suspension culture system using serum-free defined media with spinner flasks for hESC expansion as cell aggregates. With optimized cell seeding density and splitting interval, we demonstrate prolonged passaging and expansion of several hESC lines with overall expansion, yield, viability and maintenance of pluripotency equivalent to adherent culture. Human ESCs maintained in suspension as aggregates can be passaged at least 20 times to achieve over 1×1013 fold calculated expansion with high undifferentiation rate and normal karyotype. Furthermore, the aggregates are able to differentiate to cardiomyocytes in a directed fashion. Finally, we show that the cells can be cryopreserved in serum-free medium and thawed into adherent or suspension cultures to continue passaging and expansion. We have successfully used this method under cGMP or cGMP-equivalent conditions to generate cell banks of several hESC lines. Taken together, our suspension culture system provides a powerful approach for scale-up expansion of hESCs under defined and serum-free conditions for clinical and research applications.

Abstract: Summary
Many viruses induce hepatitis in humans, highlighting the need to understand the underlying mechanisms of virus-induced liver pathology. The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), causes acute hepatitis in its natural host and provides a useful model for understanding virus interaction with liver cells. The MHV accessory protein, ns2, antagonizes the type I interferon response and promotes hepatitis. We show that ns2 has 2′,5′-phosphodiesterase activity, which blocks the interferon inducible 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway to facilitate hepatitis development. Ns2 cleaves 2′,5′-oligoadenylate, the product of OAS, to prevent activation of the cellular endoribonuclease RNase L and consequently block viral RNA degradation. An ns2 mutant virus was unable to replicate in the liver or induce hepatitis in wild-type mice, but was highly pathogenic in RNase L deficient mice. Thus, RNase L is a critical cellular factor for protection against viral infection of the liver and the resulting hepatitis.

Abstract: HSPA1A is a serum and intracellular heat shock protein with antiapoptotic and antithrombotic properties. The present study examines the hypothesis that a decrease in the synthesis of this protein in relation to certain polymorphisms of the regulatory region of the HSPA1A gene can define a vascular disease risk phenotype. A randomly selected population was studied and stratified into groups according to the degree of vascular risk. After applying the Task Force Chart to 452 people, the subjects were divided into three groups: group 0 (no vascular risk factor or risk < 5%), n = 239; group 1 (moderate (10–20%) risk, with no clinical cardiovascular disease), n = 161; and group 2 (overt atherosclerosis), n = 52. Serum and intragranulocytic HSPA1A was quantified, and direct Sanger sequencing was performed in all subjects. An analysis was made of the association of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (db rs1008438 −110A/C and db rs1043618 +190 G/C) with circulating and intragranulocytic HSPA1A and the risk of atherosclerosis. The atherosclerotic subjects showed significantly lower circulating HSPA1A levels than the other groups, regardless of the genotype. The patients with CC genotype for both polymorphisms showed significantly lower intragranulocytic HSPA1A levels than the other genotypes. Serum HSPA1A concentrations could be proposed as a biomarker of cardiovascular disease. CC homozygosis for polymorphisms db rs1008438 and db rs1043618 is associated with a decrease in the intragranulocytic production of HSPA1A. Given the antiatherogenic functions of intracellular HSPA1A, the −110A and +190 G alleles could constitute potential genetic biomarkers of a less severe clinical phenotype for the risk of developing atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
After host cell entry, Salmonella replicate in membrane-bound compartments, which accumulate a dense meshwork of F-actin through the kinase activity of the Salmonella SPI-2 type III secretion effector SteC. We find that SteC promotes actin cytoskeleton reorganization by activating a signaling pathway involving the MAP kinases MEK and ERK, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and Myosin IIB. Specifically, SteC phosphorylates MEK directly on serine 200 (S200), a previously unstudied phosphorylation site. S200 phosphorylation is predicted to displace a negative regulatory helix causing autophosphorylation on the known MEK activatory residues, S218 and S222. In support of this, substitution of S200 with alanine prevented phosphorylation on S218 and S222, and phosphomimetic mutations of S200 stimulated phosphorylation of these residues. Both steC-null and kinase-deficient mutant strains displayed enhanced replication in infected cells, suggesting that SteC manipulates the actin cytoskeleton to restrain bacterial growth, thereby regulating virulence.

Abstract: Summary
The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) Tat protein, a potent activator of HIV gene expression, is essential for integrated viral genome expression and represents a potential antiviral target. Tat binds the 5′-terminal region of HIV mRNA's stem-bulge-loop structure, the transactivation-responsive (TAR) element, to activate transcription. We find that didehydro-Cortistatin A (dCA), an analog of a natural steroidal alkaloid from a marine sponge, inhibits Tat-mediated transactivation of the integrated provirus by binding specifically to the TAR-binding domain of Tat. Working at subnanomolar concentrations, dCA reduces Tat-mediated transcriptional initiation/elongation from the viral promoter to inhibit HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication in acutely and chronically infected cells. Importantly, dCA abrogates spontaneous viral particle release from CD4+T cells from virally suppressed subjects on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Thus, dCA defines a unique class of anti-HIV drugs that may inhibit viral production from stable reservoirs and reduce residual viremia during HAART.

Abstract: Current carcinogenesis theory states that only a small subset of tumor cells, the cancer stem cells or tumor initiating cells (TICs), are responsible for tumor formation and progression. Human breast cancer-initiating cells have been identified as CD44-expressing cells, which retain tumorigenic activity and display stem cell–like properties. Spontaneous feline mammary carcinoma (FMC) is an aggressive cancer, which shows biological similarities to the human tumor counterpart. We report the isolation and phenotypic characterization of FMC-derived stem/progenitor cells, showing in vitro self-renewal, long-lasting proliferation and in vivo tumorigenicity. Twenty-one FMC samples were collected, histologically classified and characterized for the expression of Ki67, EGFR, ER-α and CD44, by immunohistochemistry. By culture in stem cell permissive conditions, we isolated, from 13 FMCs, a CD44-positive subpopulation able to survive and proliferate in vitro as mammospheres of different sizes and morphologies. When injected in NOD/SCID mice, FMC stem-like cells initiate tumors, generating cell heterogeneity and recapitulating the original histotype. In serum-containing medium, spheroid cells showed differentiation properties as shown by morphological changes, the loss of CD44 expression and tumorigenic potential. These data show that stem-defined culture of FMC enriches for TICs and validate the use of these cells as a suitable model for comparative oncology studies of mammary biology and testing therapeutic strategies aimed at eradicating TICs.

Abstract: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in tumor progression, and is an early step in carcinogenesis. Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to be implicated in EMT in many tumor cell types, its exact role in EMT initiation in normal human cells, especially epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), remains unknown. To clarify whether ROS induce EMT in NHEKs, and to establish how ROS regulate EMT, we examined the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the expression of molecules involved in EMT and cell morphology in NHEKs. H2O2 altered the expression of EMT biomarkers, including downregulation of epithelial cadherin and upregulation of α-smooth muscle actin, through a transcriptional modulator, Snail1. H2O2 also induced epithelial to fibroblast-like morphological changes, together with upregulation of EMT biomarkers, and promoted phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, H2O2 stimulated the expression and secretion of TGF-β1 in NHEKs. Exogenous TGF-β1 also induced the expression of EMT biomarkers. In contrast, neutralizing antibody anti-TGF-β1 antibody or inhibitor of TGF-β receptor type I suppressed the expression of EMT biomarkers. Our results suggest that ROS stimulated TGF-β1 secretion and MAPK activation, resulting in EMT initiation in NHEKs.

Abstract: Identification of predictors of cardiovascular risk can help in the prevention of pathologic episodes and the management of patients at all stages of illness. Here, we investigated the relationships between serum levels of Hsp60 and dyslipidemia in patients with periodontitis by performing a cross-sectional study of 22 patients with mild periodontitis without any prior treatment for it (i.e., drug naïve) and 22 healthy controls, matched for age and body mass index (BMI). All subjects were evaluated for periodontal status, gingival inflammation, and oral hygiene. Levels of circulating Hsp60, C-reactive protein (CRP), and plasma lipids were measured, and small, dense low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were indirectly assessed by determining the triglycerides/high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol ratio. We also assessed by immunohistochemistry Hsp60 levels in oral mucosa of patients and controls. No difference was found in CRP levels or plasma lipids between the two groups, but subjects with periodontitis showed, in comparison to controls, higher levels of small, dense LDL (p  = 0.0355) and circulating Hsp60 concentrations (p < 0.0001). However, levels of mucosal Hsp60 did not change significantly between groups. Correlation analysis revealed that circulating Hsp60 inversely correlated with HDL-cholesterol (r  = −0.589, p  = 0.0039), and positively with triglycerides (r  = +0.877, p < 0.0001), and small, dense LDL (r  = +0.925, p < 0.0001). Serum Hsp60 significantly correlated with the degree of periodontal disease (r  = +0.403, p  = 0.0434). In brief, untreated patients with mild periodontitis had increased small, dense LDL and serum Hsp60 concentrations, in comparison to age- and BMI-matched controls and both parameters showed a strong positive correlation. Our data indicate that atherogenic dyslipidemia and elevated circulating Hsp60 tend to be linked and associated to periodontal pathology. Thus, the road is open to investigate the potential value of elevated levels of circulating Hsp60 as predictor of risk for cardiovascular disease when associated to dyslipidemia in periodontitis patients.

We have previously demonstrated that using platelet lysate (PL) instead of widely used fetal calf serum (FCS) diminished lipid accumulation in adipogenically stimulated human MSCs and identified, among others, lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS) as a gene suppressed in PL-supplemented MSCs. Here, we investigated the role of PL and putatively pro-adipogenic L-PGDS in human MSC adipogenesis. Next to strongly reduced levels of L-PGDS we show that PL-supplemented MSCs display markedly decreased expression of adipogenic master regulators and differentiation markers, both before and after induction of adipocyte differentiation. The low adipogenic differentiation capability of PL-supplemented MSCs could be partially restored by exogenous addition of L-PGDS protein. Conversely, siRNA-mediated downregulation of L-PGDS in FCS-supplemented MSCs profoundly reduced adipocyte differentiation. In contrast, inhibiting endogenous prostaglandin synthesis by aspirin did not reduce differentiation, suggesting that a mechanism such as lipid shuttling but not the prostaglandin D2 synthase activity of L-PGDS is critical for adipogenesis. Our data demonstrate that L-PGDS is a novel pro-adipogenic factor in human MSCs which might be of relevance in adipocyte metabolism and disease. L-PGDS gene expression is a potential quality marker for human MSCs, as it might predict unwanted adipogenic differentiation after MSC transplantation.

Abstract: Colorectal carcinoma is a frequent cause of cancer-related death in men and women throughout the world. MicroRNAs are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. We investigated the role of ADAM-17 (a desintegrin and metalloproteases 17) as a novel multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanism in multidrug-resistant colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and the role of miR-222 in the development of MDR in CRC cells. We found that the high expression of ADAM-17, which results in growth factor shedding and growth factor receptor activation could induce drug resistance in CRC. Pharmacological inhibition of ADAM-17, in conjunction with chemotherapy, may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of CRC. ADAM-17 is a predicted target of miR-222, which was downregulated in multidrug-resistant CRC cells. The presence of miR-222 was consistently inversely proportionate to the expression levels of ADAM-17. We found that elevated levels of miR-222 in the mimics-transfected HCT116/L-OHP and HCT-8/VCR cells reduced the ADAM-17 protein level and the luciferase activity of an ADAM-17 3′ untranslated region-based reporter and sensitized these cells’ apoptosis to some anticancer drugs. Our findings suggest that miR-222 could play a role in the development of MDR by modulation of ADAM-17, the new MDR treatment target in colorectal carcinoma cells.

Abstract: Clinically relevant in vitro methods are needed to identify new cancer drugs for solid tumors. We report on a new 3-D spheroid cell culture system aimed to mimic the properties of solid tumors in vivo. The colon cancer cell lines HCT-116 wt and HCT-116 wt/GFP were grown as monolayers and for 3 or 6days on 96-well NanoCulture® plates to form spheroids. Expression of surface markers, genes and hypoxia were assessed to characterize the spheroids and drug induced cytotoxicity was evaluated based on fluorescein diacetate (FDA) conversion by viable cells to fluorescent fluorescein or by direct measurement of fluorescence of GFP marked cells after a 72h drug incubation. The cells reproducibly formed spheroids in the NanoCulture® plates with tight cell-attachment after 6days. Cells in spheroids showed geno- and phenotypical properties reminiscent of hypoxic stem cells. Monolayer cultured cells were sensitive to standard and investigational drugs, whereas the spheroids gradually turned resistant. Similar results for cytotoxicity were observed using simplified direct measurement of fluorescence of GFP marked cells compared with FDA incubation. In conclusion, this new 3-D spheroid cell culture system provides a convenient and clinically relevant model for the identification and characterization of cancer drugs for solid tumors.

Abstract: Cell migration is a common cellular process in angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. Rudhira/BCAS3 (Breast Cancer Amplified Sequence 3) is a conserved protein expressed in the embryonic vasculature and malignant tumors. Here, we show for the first time that Rudhira plays an active role in directional cell migration. Rudhira depletion in endothelial cells inhibits Matrigel-induced tube formation and retards healing of wounded cell monolayers. We demonstrate that during wound healing, Rudhira rapidly re-localizes and promotes Cdc42 activation and recruitment to the leading edge of migrating cells. Rudhira deficient cells show impaired downstream signaling of Cdc42 leading to dramatic changes in actin organization and classic cell polarity defects such as loss of microtubule organizing center (MTOC) and Golgi re-orientation. Biochemical assays and co-localization studies show that Rudhira interacts with microtubules as well as intermediate filaments. Thus, Rudhira could control directional cell migration and angiogenesis by facilitating crosstalk between cytoskeletal elements.

Abstract: Growing evidence indicates that nerves and capillaries interact paracrinely in uninjured skin and cutaneous wounds. Although mature neurons are the predominant neural cell in the skin, neural progenitor cells have also been detected in uninjured adult skin. The aim of this study was to characterize differential paracrine effects of neural progenitor cells and mature sensory neurons on dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Our results suggest that neural progenitor cells and mature sensory neurons have unique secretory profiles and distinct effects on dermal microvascular endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and nitric oxide production. Neural progenitor cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons secrete different proteins related to angiogenesis. Specific to neural progenitor cells were dipeptidyl peptidase-4, IGFBP-2, pentraxin-3, serpin f1, TIMP-1, TIMP-4 and VEGF. In contrast, endostatin, FGF-1, MCP-1 and thrombospondin-2 were specific to dorsal root ganglion neurons. Microvascular endothelial cell proliferation was inhibited by dorsal root ganglion neurons but unaffected by neural progenitor cells. In contrast, microvascular endothelial cell migration in a scratch wound assay was inhibited by neural progenitor cells and unaffected by dorsal root ganglion neurons. In addition, nitric oxide production by microvascular endothelial cells was increased by dorsal root ganglion neurons but unaffected by neural progenitor cells.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is an essential cytokine that regulates endothelial function and angiogenesis. VEGF-A binding to endothelial receptor tyrosine kinases such as VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 triggers cellular responses including survival, proliferation and new blood vessel sprouting. Increased levels of a soluble VEGFR1 splice variant (sFlt-1) correlate with endothelial dysfunction in pathologies such as pre-eclampsia; however the cellular mechanism(s) underlying the regulation and function of sFlt-1 are unclear. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a biphasic stress response in endothelial cells, using serum deprivation as a model of endothelial dysfunction. The early phase is characterized by a high VEGFR2:sFlt-1 ratio, which is reversed in the late phase. A functional consequence is a short-term increase in VEGF-A-stimulated intracellular signaling. In the late phase, sFlt-1 is secreted and deposited at the extracellular matrix. We hypothesized that under stress, increased endothelial sFlt-1 levels reduce VEGF-A bioavailability: VEGF-A treatment induces sFlt-1 expression at the cell surface and VEGF-A silencing inhibits sFlt-1 anchorage to the extracellular matrix. Treatment with recombinant sFlt-1 inhibits VEGF-A-stimulated in vitro angiogenesis and sFlt-1 silencing enhances this process. In this response, increased VEGFR2 levels are regulated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and PKB/Akt signaling pathways and increased sFlt-1 levels by the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. We conclude that during serum withdrawal, cellular sensing of environmental stress modulates sFlt-1 and VEGFR2 levels, regulating VEGF-A bioavailability and ensuring cell survival takes precedence over cell proliferation and migration. These findings may underpin an important mechanism contributing to endothelial dysfunction in pathological states.

Abstract: Summary
Some bacteria invade host cells by triggering a process akin to phagocytosis. We analyzed the mechanisms underlying invasion vacuole formation by the bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. After engaging integrins on host cells, Yersinia resided in PI(4,5)P2-rich, membrane-bound compartments called “prevacuoles” that were inaccessible to extracellular antibodies but remained connected to the plasma membrane. The scission of prevacuoles to form separate, sealed compartments coincided with and required PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis. At the time of scission, the inositol 5-phosphatases OCRL and Inpp5b were recruited to prevacuoles. This recruitment and subsequent PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis required the association of the GTPase Rab5 with prevacuoles. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity was required for fusion of Rab5-positive vesicles with prevacuoles and scission of nascent vacuoles from the plasma membrane. Thus, Yersinia invasion involves a multistep process in which the bacteria form a protective prevacuole and then recruit host factors to induce membrane fission, allowing the bacteria to invade the cell.

Abstract: Summary
Erythrocytes carrying a variant hemoglobin allele (HbS), which causes sickle cell disease and resists infection by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The molecular basis of this resistance, which has long been recognized as multifactorial, remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) composition, of either heterozygous HbAS or homozygous HbSS erythrocytes, contributes to resistance against P. falciparum. During the intraerythrocytic life cycle of P. falciparum, a subset of erythrocyte miRNAs translocate into the parasite. Two miRNAs, miR-451 and let-7i, were highly enriched in HbAS and HbSS erythrocytes, and these miRNAs, along with miR-223, negatively regulated parasite growth. Surprisingly, we found that miR-451 and let-7i integrated into essential parasite messenger RNAs and, via impaired ribosomal loading, resulted in translational inhibition. Hence, sickle cell erythrocytes exhibit cell-intrinsic resistance to malaria in part through an atypical miRNA activity, which may represent a unique host defense strategy against complex eukaryotic pathogens.

Abstract: Fusion between cancer cells and host cells, including endothelial cells, may strongly modulate the biological behavior of tumors. However, no one is sure about the driving factors and underlying mechanism involved in such fusion. We hypothesized in this study that inflammation, one of the main characteristics in tumor microenvironment, serves as a prominent catalyst for fusion events. Our results showed that oral cancer cells can fuse spontaneously with endothelial cells in co-culture and inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) increased fusion of human umbilical vein endothelium cells and oral cancer cells by up to 3-fold in vitro. Additionally, human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and 35 out of 50 (70%) oral squamous carcinoma specimens express VLA-4, an integrin, previously implicated in fusions between human peripheral blood CD34-positive cells and murine cardiomyocytes. Expression of VCAM-1, a ligand for VLA-4, was evident on vascular endothelium of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry analysis revealed that expression of VCAM-1 increased obviously in TNF-α-stimulated endothelial cells. Anti-VLA-4 or anti-VCAM-1 treatment can decrease significantly cancer–endothelial adhesion and block such fusion. Collectively, our results suggested that TNF-α could enhance cancer–endothelial cell adhesion and fusion through VCAM-1/VLA-4 pathway. This study provides insights into regulatory mechanism of cancer–endothelial cell fusion, and has important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for prevention of metastasis.

Abstract: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been tested and proven effective in some neurodegenerative diseases, but their tracking after transplantation may be challenging. Our group has previously demonstrated the feasibility and biosafety of rat MSC labeling with iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPION). In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of SPION-labeled MSC in a rat model of Huntington's disease, a genetic degenerative disease with characteristic deletion of striatal GABAergic neurons. MSC labeled with SPION were injected into the striatum 1h after quinolinic acid injection. FJ-C analysis demonstrated that MSC transplantation significantly decreased the number of degenerating neurons in the damaged striatum 7days after lesion. In this period, MSC transplantation enhanced the striatal expression of FGF-2 but did not affect subventricular zone proliferation, as demonstrated by Ki67 proliferation assay. In addition, MSC transplantation significantly reduced the ventriculomegaly in the lesioned brain. MRI and histological techniques detected the presence of the SPION-labeled cells at the lesion site. SPION-labeled MSC produced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals that were visible for at least 60days after transplantation. Our data highlight the potential of adult MSC to reduce brain damage under neurodegenerative diseases and indicate the use of nanoparticles in cell tracking, supporting their potential as valuable tools for cell therapy.

Abstract: Gefitinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of potential use in patients with breast cancer. Unfortunately, in clinical studies, gefitinib is often ineffective indicating that resistance to EGFR inhibitors may be a common occurrence in cancer of the breast. EGFR has been shown to be overexpressed in breast cancer, and in particular remains hyperphosphorylated in cell lines such as MDA-MB-468 that are resistant to EGFR inhibitors. Here, we investigate the cause of this sustained phosphorylation and the molecular basis for the ineffectiveness of gefitinib. We show that reactive oxygen species (ROS), known to damage cellular macromolecules and to modulate signaling cascades in a variety of human diseases including cancers, appear to play a critical role in mediating EGFR TKI-resistance. Furthermore, elimination of these ROS through use of a cell-penetrating catalase derivative sensitizes the cells to gefitinib. These results suggest a new approach for the treatment of TKI-resistant breast cancer patients specifically, the targeting of ROS and attendant downstream oxidative stress and their effects on signaling cascades.

Abstract: The role of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) in high glucose-induced intracellular signal transduction has yet to be elucidated. We investigated whether Syk is implicated in high glucose-induced transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) up-regulation in cultured human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cell). High glucose increased TGF-β1 gene expression through Syk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), AP-1 and NF-κB. High glucose-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity was decreased by Syk inhibitors and U0126 (an ERK inhibitor). Syk inhibitors suppressed high glucose-induced ERK activation, whereas U0126 had no effect on Syk activation. High glucose-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity was also decreased by Syk inhibitors. High glucose increased nuclear translocation of p65 without serine phosphorylation of IκBα and without degradation of IκBα, but with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα that may account for the activation of NF-κB. Both Syk inhibitors and Syk-siRNA attenuated high glucose-induced IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation. Depletion of p21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2) by transfection of Pak2-siRNA abolished high glucose-induced Syk activation. In summary, high glucose-induced TGF-β1 gene transcription occurred through Pak2, Syk and subsequent ERK/AP-1 and NF-κB pathways. This suggests that Syk might be implicated in the diabetic kidney disease.

Abstract: The Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE) is a regulator of transcription in the thymic medulla, where it controls the expression of a large set of peripheral-tissue specific genes. AIRE interacts with the transcriptional coactivator and acetyltransferase CBP and synergistically cooperates with it in transcriptional activation. Here, we aimed to study a possible role of AIRE acetylation in the modulation of its activity. We found that AIRE is acetylated in tissue culture cells and this acetylation is enhanced by overexpression of CBP and the CBP paralog p300. The acetylated lysines were located within nuclear localization signal and SAND domain. AIRE with mutations that mimicked acetylated K243 and K253 in the SAND domain had reduced transactivation activity and accumulated into fewer and larger nuclear bodies, whereas mutations that mimicked the unacetylated lysines were functionally similar to wild-type AIRE. Analogously to CBP, p300 localized to AIRE-containing nuclear bodies, however, the overexpression of p300 did not enhance the transcriptional activation of AIRE-regulated genes. Further studies showed that overexpression of p300 stabilized the AIRE protein. Interestingly, gene expression profiling revealed that AIRE, with mutations mimicking K243/K253 acetylation in SAND, was able to activate gene expression, although the affected genes were different and the activation level was lower from those regulated by wild-type AIRE. Our results suggest that the AIRE acetylation can influence the selection of AIRE activated genes.

Abstract: This study reports an effect of taurine (1–10mM) increasing markedly (120%) the number of neural precursor cells (NPCs) from adult mouse subventricular zone, cultured as neurospheres. This effect is one of the highest reported for adult neural precursor cells. Taurine-containing cultures showed 73–120% more cells than controls, after 24 and 96h in culture, respectively. Taurine effect is due to enhanced proliferation as assessed by BrdU incorporation assays. In taurine cultures BrdU incorporation was markedly higher than controls from 1.5 to 48h, with the maximal difference found at 1.5h. This effect of taurine reproduced at every passage with the same window time. Taurine effects are not mimicked by glycine, alanine or GABA. Clonal efficiency values of 3.6% for taurine cultures and 1.3% for control cultures suggest a taurine influence on both, progenitor and stem cells. Upon differentiation, the proportion of neurons in control and taurine cultures was 3.1% (±0.5) and 10.2% (±0.8), respectively. These results are relevant for taurine implication in brain development as well as in adult neurogenesis. Possible mechanisms underlying taurine effects on cell proliferation are discussed.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are chaperones that are known to have important roles in facilitating protein synthesis, protein assembly and cellular protection. While HSPs are known to be induced by damaging exercise, little is known about how HSPs actually mediate skeletal muscle adaption to exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a heat shock pretreatment and the ensuing increase in HSP expression on early remodeling and signaling (2 and 48 h) events of the soleus (Sol) muscle following a bout of downhill running. Male Wistar rats (10 weeks old) were randomly assigned to control, eccentric exercise (EE; downhill running) or heat shock + eccentric exercise (HS; 41°C for 20 min, 48 h prior to exercise) groups. Markers of muscle damage, muscle regeneration and intracellular signaling were assessed. The phosphorylation (p) of HSP25, Akt, p70s6k, ERK1/2 and JNK proteins was also performed. As expected, following exercise the EE group had increased creatine kinase (CK; 2 h) and mononuclear cell infiltration (48 h) compared to controls. The EE group had an increase in p-HSP25, but there was no change in HSP72 expression, total protein concentration, or neonatal MHC content. Additionally, the EE group had increased p-p70s6k, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK (2 h) compared to controls; however no changes in p-Akt were seen. In contrast, the HS group had reduced CK (2 h) and mononuclear cell infiltration (48 h) compared to EE. Moreover, the HS group had increased HSP72 content (2 and 48 h), total protein concentration (48 h), neonatal MHC content (2 and 48 h), p-HSP25 and p-p70s6k (2 h). Lastly, the HS group had reduced p-Akt (48 h) and p-ERK1/2 (2 h). These data suggest that heat shock pretreatment and/or the ensuing HSP72 response may protect against muscle damage, and enhance increases in total protein and neonatal MHC content following exercise. These changes appear to be independent of Akt and MAPK signaling pathways.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrated that mature atrocytes have the capacity for de-differentiating into neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in vitro and in vivo. However, it is still unknown what signals endow astroglial cells with a de-differentiation potential. Furthermore, the signaling molecules and underlying mechanism that confer astrocytes with the competence of NSPC phenotypes have not been completely elucidated. Here, we found that sonic hedgehog (Shh) production in astrocytes following mechanical injury was significantly elevated, and that incubation of astrocyes with the injured astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) causes astrocytes to gradually lose their immunophenotypical profiles, and acquire NSPC characteristics, as demonstrated by down-regulation of typical astrocytic markers (GFAP and S100) and up-regulation of markers that are generally expressed in NSCs, (nestin, Sox2, and CD133). ACM treated astrocytes exhibit self-renewal capacity and multipotency similar to NSPCs. Concomitantly, in addition to Ptc, there was a significant up-regulation of the Shh downstream signal components Gli2 and Cyclin D1 which are involved in cell proliferation, dramatic changes in cell morphology, and the disruption of cell-cycle G1 arrest. Conversely, the depletion of Shh by administration of its neutralizing antibody (Shh n-Ab) effectively inhibited the de-differentiation process. Strikingly, Shh alone had little effect on astrocyte de-differentiation to NSPCs. These data above suggest that Shh is a key instructive molecule while other molecules secreted from insulted astrocytes may synergistically promote the de-differentiation event.

Abstract: Numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of Tβ4 on cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation after exogenous treatment, but the mechanism by which Tβ4 functions is still unclear. Previously, we demonstrated that incubation of endothelial cells with Tβ4 induced synthesis and secretion of various proteins, including plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and matrix metaloproteinases. We also showed that Tβ4 interacts with Ku80, which may operate as a novel receptor for Tβ4 and mediates its intracellular activity. In this paper, we provide evidence that Tβ4 induces cellular processes without changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. External treatment of HUVECs with Tβ4 and its mutants deprived of the N-terminal tetrapeptide AcSDKP (Tβ4AcSDKPT/4A) or the actin-binding sequence KLKKTET (Tβ4KLKKTET/7A) resulted in enhanced cell migration and formation of tubular structures in Matrigel. Surprisingly, the increased cell motility caused by Tβ4 was not associated with the intracellular Ca2+ elevation monitored with Fluo-4 NW or Fura-2 AM. Therefore, it is unlikely that externally added Tβ4 induces HUVEC migration via the surface membrane receptors known to generate Ca2+ influx. Our data confirm the concept that externally added Tβ4 must be internalized to induce intracellular mechanisms supporting endothelial cell migration.

Abstract: Trio-associated repeat on actin (Tara) is an F-actin binding protein and regulates actin cytoskeletal organization. In our previous study, we have found that Tara associates with telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) and mediates the function of TRF1 in mitotic regulation. We also found that overexpression HECTD3, a member of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, enhances the ubiquitination of Tara in vivo and promotes the degradation of Tara, and such degradation of Tara facilitates cell cycle progression. However, less is known about the post-translational modification of Tara in mitosis. Here we show that Tara is a novel Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) target protein. Plk1 interacts with and phosphorylates Tara in vivo and in vitro. Actually, the Thr-457 in Tara was a bona fide in vivo phosphorylation site for Plk1. Interestingly, we found that the centrosomal localization of Tara depended on the Thr-457 phosphorylation and the kinase activity of Plk1. Furthermore, overexpression of non-phosphorylatable mutant of Tara caused aberrant mitosis delay in HeLa cells. Our study demonstrated that Plk1-mediated phospho-dependent centrosomal localization of Tara is important for faithful chromosome segregation, and provided novel insights into understanding on the role of Plk1 in cooperation with Tara in mitotic progression.

Abstract: Mammalian cells respond to a lack of amino acids by activating a transcriptional program with the transcription factor ATF4 as one of the main actors. When cells are faced with cytoplasmic proteotoxic stress, a quite different transcriptional response is mounted, the heat shock response, which is mediated by HSF1. Here, we show that amino acid deprivation results in the inactivation of HSF1. In amino acid deprived cells, active HSF1 loses its DNA binding activity as demonstrated by EMSA and ChIP. A sharp decrease in the transcript level of HSF1 target genes such as HSPA1A (Hsp70), DNAJB1 (Hsp40), and HSP90AA1 is also seen. HSPA1A mRNA, but not DNAJB1 mRNA, was also destabilized. In cells cultured with limiting leucine, HSF1 activity also declined. Lack of amino acids thus could lead to a lower chaperoning capacity and cellular frailty. We show that the nutrient sensing response unit of the ASNS gene contains an HSF1 binding site, but we could not detect binding of HSF1 to this site in vivo. Expression of either an HSF1 mutant lacking the activation domain (HSF379) or an HSF1 mutant unable to bind DNA (K80Q) had only a minor effect on the transcript levels of amino acid deprivation responsive genes.

Abstract: Summary
Overcoming the cellular type I interferon (IFN) host defense response is critical for a virus to ensure successful infection. Investigating the effects of human adenovirus (HAdV) infection on global cellular histone posttranslational modification (hPTM), we discovered that virus infection-induced activation of IFN signaling triggers a global increase in the monoubiquitination of histone 2B (H2B) at lysine 120, which is a mark for transcriptionally active chromatin. This hPTM, catalyzed by the hBre1/RNF20 complex, is necessary for activation of the cellular IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression program in response to viruses. To establish effective infection, the HAdV E1A protein binds to and dissociates the hBre1 complex to block IFN-induced H2B monoubiquitination and associated ISG expression. Together, these data uncover a key role for H2B monoubiquitination in the type I IFN response and a viral mechanism of antagonizing this hPTM to evade the IFN response.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogens commonly utilize endocytic pathways to gain cellular access. The endosomal pattern recognition receptors TLR7 and TLR9 detect pathogen-encoded nucleic acids to initiate MyD88-dependent proinflammatory responses to microbial infection. Using genome-wide RNAi screening and integrative systems-based analysis, we identify 190 cofactors required for TLR7- and TLR9-directed signaling responses. A set of cofactors were crossprofiled for their activities downstream of several immunoreceptors and then functionally mapped based on the known architecture of NF-κB signaling pathways. Protein complexes and pathways involved in ubiquitin-protein ligase activities, sphingolipid metabolism, chromatin modifications, and ancient stress responses were found to modulate innate recognition of endosomal nucleic acids. Additionally, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) was characterized as necessary for ubiquitin-dependent TLR9 targeting to the endolysosome. Proteins and pathways identified here should prove useful in delineating strategies to manipulate innate responses for treatment of autoimmune disorders and microbial infection.

Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is often resistant to conventional chemotherapy and thus requires novel treatment regimens. Here, we investigated the effects of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in combination with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) or agonistic TRAIL receptor 1 (DR4)-specific monoclonal antibody, AY4, on sensitization of TRAIL- and AY4-resistant human HNSCC cell lines. Combination treatment of HNSCC cells synergistically induced apoptotic cell death accompanied by caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation and Bid cleavage into truncated Bid (tBid). Generation and accumulation of tBid through the cooperative action of MG132 with TRAIL or AY4 and Bik accumulation through MG132-mediated proteasome inhibition are critical to the synergistic apoptosis. In HNSCC cells, Bak was constrained by Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL, but not by Bcl-2. Conversely, Bax did not interact with Mcl-1, Bcl-XL, or Bcl-2. Importantly, tBid plays a major role in Bax activation, and Bik indirectly activates Bak by displacing it from Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL, pointing to the synergistic mechanism of the combination treatment. In addition, knockdown of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL significantly sensitized HNSCC cells to TRAIL and AY4 as a single agent, suggesting that Bak constraint by Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL is an important resistance mechanism of TRAIL receptor-mediated apoptotic cell death. Our results provide a novel molecular mechanism for the potent synergy between MG132 proteasome inhibitor and TRAIL receptor agonists in HNSCC cells, suggesting that the combination of these agents may offer a new therapeutic strategy for HNSCC treatment.

Abstract: Although (GT)n repeats in heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) promoter may modulate gene transcriptional activity, the association between (GT)n repeats polymorphism and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) from different levels of oxidative stress (OS) is unknown. We determined the allelic frequencies of (GT)n repeats in the HO-1 gene promoter and plasma malonaldehyde (MDA) as biomarkers of OS in 2,298 pairs of CHD patients and controls in the Chinese population. Furthermore, we measured MDA in culture mediums and HO-1 expressions levels in cell lysates of endothelial cells carrying various (GT)n genotypes under different concentrations of H2O2. Compared with L/L genotype (>25 repeats) carriers, the adjusted odd ratios for S/S genotype (≤25 repeats) in subjects with different levels of OS (MDA < 1.83, 1.83–2.91, >2.91 μmol/L) were 1.06 (95%CI, 0.75 to 1.49), 0.79 (95%CI, 0.55 to 1.12), and 0.60 (95%CI, 0.44 to 0.81), respectively (Pinteraction = 0.002). In biological experiments, compared with endothelial cells carrying L/L genotype, cells with S/S genotype did not have a significantly higher HO-1 expression under 0 μmol/L H2O2, but displayed a significantly higher HO-1 expression under 50 μmol/L H2O2 (Pinteraction = 0.003). S/S genotype in HO-1 gene promoter is associated with a lower risk of CHD in subjects with higher levels of OS, because under conditions of high OS, the S/S genotype has higher levels of HO-1, an antioxidant.

Abstract: Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4/GKLF/EZF) is a zinc finger type of transcription factor highly expressed in the skin, intestine, testis, lung and bone. The role played by Klf4 has been studied extensively in normal epithelial development and maintenance; however, its role in bone cells is unknown. Previous reports showed that Klf4 is expressed in the developing flat bones but its expression diminishes postnatally. We now show that in the developing long bones, Klf4 is expressed in the perichondrium, trabecular osteoblasts and prehypertrophic chondrocytes. In contrast, osteoblasts lining at the surface of the bone collar showed extremely low levels of Klf4 expression. To investigate the possible roles played by Klf4 during skeletal development, we generated transgenic mice expressing Klf4 under mouse type I collagen regulatory sequence. Transgenic mice exhibited severe skeletal deformities and died soon after birth. Transgenic mice showed delayed formation of the calvarial bones; and over-expressing Klf4 in primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts in culture resulted in strong repression of mineralization indicating that this regulation of Klf4 is through an osteoblast-autonomous effect. Surprisingly, long bones of the transgenic mice exhibited delayed marrow cavity formation. Even at E18.5, the presumptive marrow space was occupied by cartilage anlage and invasion of the vascular endothelial cells and osteoclasts were seldom observed. Instead of entering the cartilage anlage, osteoclasts accumulated at the periosteum in the transgenic mice. Significantly, osteocalcin, which is known to chemotact osteoclasts, was up-regulated at the perichindrium as early as E14.5 in the mutants. In vitro studies showed that this induction of osteocalcin by Klf4 was regulated at its transcriptional level. Our results demonstrate that Klf4 regulates normal skeletal development through coordinating the differentiation and migration of osteoblasts, chondrocytes, vascular endothelial cells and osteoclasts.

Abstract: The adapters IRS1 and IRS2 link growth factor receptors to downstream signaling pathways that regulate proliferation and survival. Both suppress factor-withdrawal-induced apoptosis and have been implicated in cancer progression. However, recent studies suggest IRS1 and IRS2 mediate differential functions in cancer pathogenesis. IRS1 promoted breast cancer proliferation, while IRS2 promoted metastasis. The role of IRS1 and IRS2 in controlling cell responses to chemotherapy is unknown. To determine the role of IRS1 and IRS2 in the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy, we treated 32D cells lacking or expressing IRS proteins with various concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents. We found that expression of IRS1, in contrast to IRS2, enhanced the sensitivity of 32D cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. When IRS2 was expressed with IRS1, the cells no longer showed enhanced sensitivity. Expression of IRS1 did not alter the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins; however, 32D-IRS1 cells expressed higher levels of Annexin A2. In 32D-IRS1 cells, IRS1 and Annexin A2 were both located in cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. We also found that IRS1 coprecipitated with Annexin A2, while IRS2 did not. Decreasing Annexin A2 levels reduced 32D-IRS1 cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. These results suggest IRS1 enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy in part through Annexin A2.

Abstract: Phospholipase C-δ1 (PLCδ1) is a widely expressed highly active PLC isoform, modulated by Ca2+ that appears to operate downstream from receptor signaling and has been linked to regulation of cytokine production. Here we investigated whether PLCδ1 modulated expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in rat C6 glioma cells. Expression of PLCδ1 was specifically suppressed by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the effects on cytokine mRNA expression, stimulated by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were examined. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results showed that PLCδ1 knockdown enhanced expression IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA by at least 100 fold after 4h of LPS stimulation compared to control siRNA treatment. PLCδ1 knock down caused persistently high Nfκb levels at 4h of LPS stimulation compared to control siRNA-treated cells. PLCδ1 knockdown was also associated with elevated nuclear levels of c-Jun after 30min of LPS stimulation, but did not affect LPS-stimulated p38 or p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation, normally associated with TLR activation of cytokine gene expression; rather, enhanced protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of cellular proteins was observed in the absence of LPS stimulation. An inhibitor of PKC, bisindolylmaleimide II (BIM), reversed phosphorylation, prevented elevation of nuclear c-Jun levels, and inhibited LPS-induced increases of IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA’s induced by PLCδ1 knockdown. Our results show that loss of PLCδ1 enhances PKC/c-Jun signaling and up-modulates pro-inflammatory cytokine gene transcription in concert with the TLR-stimulated p38MAPK/Nfκb pathway. Our findings are consistent with the idea that PLCδ1 is a suppressor of PKC activity.

Abstract: Summary
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is an enteropathogenic bacteria that disrupts the intestinal barrier and invades its host through gut-associated lymphoid tissue and Peyer's patches (PP). We show that the Y. pseudotuberculosis effector YopJ induces intestinal barrier dysfunction by subverting signaling of the innate immune receptor Nod2, a phenotype that can be reversed by pretreating with the Nod2 ligand muramyl-dipeptide. YopJ, but not the catalytically inactive mutant YopJC172A, acetylates critical sites in the activation loops of the RICK and TAK1 kinases, which are central mediators of Nod2 signaling, and decreases the affinity of Nod2 for RICK. Concomitantly, Nod2 interacts with and activates caspase-1, resulting in increased levels of IL-1β. Finally, IL-1β within PP plays an essential role in inducing intestinal barrier dysfunction. Thus, YopJ alters intestinal permeability and promotes the dissemination of Yersinia as well as commensal bacteria by exploiting the mucosal inflammatory response.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising cellular therapeutic for the treatment of a variety of disorders. On transplantation, MSCs interact with diverse extracellular matrices (ECMs) that vary dramatically in topographic feature type, size and surface order. In order to investigate the impact of these topographic cues, surfaces were fabricated with either isotropically ordered holes or anisotropically ordered ridges and grooves. To simulate the biologically relevant nano through micron size scale, a series of topographically patterned substrates possessing features of differing pitch (pitch=feature width+groove width) were created. Results document that the surface order and size of substratum topographic features dramatically modulate fundamental MSC behaviors. Topographically patterned (ridge+groove) surfaces were found to significantly impact MSC alignment, elongation, and aspect ratio. Novel findings also demonstrate that submicron surfaces patterned with holes resulted in increased MSC alignment to adjacent cells as well as increased migration rates. Overall, this study demonstrates that the presentation of substratum topographic cues dramatically influence MSC behaviors in a size and shape dependent manner. The response of MSCs to substratum topographic cues was similar to other cell types that have been studied previously with regards to cell shape on ridge and groove surfaces but differed with respect to proliferation and migration. This is the first study to compare the impact of anisotropically ordered ridge and groove topographic cues to isotropically order holed topographic cues on fundamental MSC behaviors across a range of biologically relevant size scales.

Abstract: Focal inflammation causes systemic fever. Cancer hyperthermia therapy results in shrinkage of tumors by various mechanisms, including induction of adaptive immune response. However, the physiological meaning of systemic fever and mechanisms of tumor shrinkage by hyperthermia have not been completely understood. In this study, we investigated how heat shock influences the adaptive immune system. We established a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone (#IM29) specific for survivin, one of the tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), from survivin peptide-immunized cancer patients’ peripheral blood, and the CTL activities were investigated in several temperature conditions (37–41 °C). Cytotoxicity and IFN-γ secretion of CTL were greatest under 39°C condition, whereas they were minimum under 41 °C. To address the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon, we investigated the apoptosis status of CTLs, expression of CD3, CD8, and TCRαβ by flow cytometry, and expression of perforin, granzyme B, and Fas ligand by western blot analysis. The expression of perforin and granzyme B were upregulated under temperature conditions of 39 and 41 °C. On the other hand, CTL cell death was induced under 41°C condition with highest Caspase-3 activity. Therefore, the greatest cytotoxicity activity at 39°C might depend on upregulation of cytotoxic granule proteins including perforin and granzyme B. These results suggest that heat shock enhances effector phase of the adaptive immune system and promotes eradication of microbe and tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal mucus barrier prevents pathogen invasion and maintains host-microbiota homeostasis. We show that fatty acid synthase (FAS), an insulin-responsive enzyme essential for de novo lipogenesis, helps maintain the mucus barrier by regulating Mucin 2, the dominant mucin in the colon and a central component of mucus. Inducible Cre recombinase-directed inactivation of the FAS gene in the colonic epithelium of mice is associated with disruptions in the intestinal mucus barrier as well as increased intestinal permeability, colitis, systemic inflammation, and changes in gut microbial ecology. FAS deficiency blocked the generation of palmitoylated Mucin 2, which must be S-palmitoylated at its N terminus for proper secretion and function. Furthermore, a diabetic mouse model exhibited lower FAS levels and a decreased mucus layer, which could be restored with insulin treatment. Thus, the role of FAS in maintaining intestinal barrier function may explain the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in diabetes and other disorders.

Abstract: Neuroblastoma is a solid tumor that mostly occurs in children. Malignant neuroblastomas have poor prognosis because conventional chemotherapeutic agents are hardly effective. Survivin, which is highly expressed in some malignant neuroblastomas, plays a significant role in inhibiting differentiation and apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. We examined consequences of survivin knockdown by survivin short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmid and then treatment with (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea flavonoid, in malignant neuroblastoma cells. Our Western blotting and laser scanning confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that survivin was highly expressed in malignant neuroblastoma SK-N-BE2 and SH-SY5Y cell lines and slightly in SK-N-DZ cell line. Expression of survivin was very faint in malignant neuroblastoma IMR32 cell line. We transfected SK-N-BE2 and SH-SY-5Y cells with survivin shRNA, treated with EGCG, and confirmed knockdown of survivin at mRNA and protein levels. Survivin knockdown induced morphological features of neuronal differentiation, as we observed following in situ methylene blue staining. Combination of survivin shRNA and EGCG promoted neuronal differentiation biochemically by increases in the expression of NFP, NSE, and e-cadherin and also decreases in the expression of Notch-1, ID2, hTERT, and PCNA. Our in situ Wright staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining showed that combination therapy was highly effective in inducing, respectively, morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis. Apoptosis occurred with activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid to tBid, increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and increases in the expression and activity of calpain and caspase-3. Combination therapy decreased migration of cells through matrigel and inhibited proliferative (p-Akt and NF-κB), invasive (MMP-2 and MMP-9), and angiogenic (VEGF and b-FGF) factors. Also, in vitro network formation ability of cells was significantly inhibited by survivin silencing and completely by combination of survivin silencing and EGCG treatment. Collectively, survivin silencing potentiated anti-cancer effects of EGCG in human malignant neuroblastoma cells having survivin overexpression.

Protein refolding in peroxisomes is dependent upon an HSF1-regulated function,

Abstract: Post-heat shock refolding of luciferase requires chaperones. Expression of a dominant negative HSF1 mutant (dnHSF1), which among other effects depletes cells of HSF1-regulated chaperones, blocked post-heat shock refolding of luciferase targeted to the cytoplasm, nucleus, or peroxisomes, while refolding of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted luciferase was inhibited by about 50 %. Luciferase refolding in the cytoplasm could be partially restored by expression of HSPA1A and fully by both HSPA1A and DNAJB1. For full refolding of ER luciferase, HSPA1A expression sufficed. Neither nuclear nor peroxisomal refolding was rescued by HSPA1A. A stimulatory effect of DNAJB1 on post-heat shock peroxisomal luciferase refolding was seen in control cells, while refolding in the cytoplasm or nucleus in control cells was inhibited by DNAJB1 expression in the absence of added HSPA1A. HSPB1 also improved refolding of peroxisomal luciferase in control cells, but not in dnHSF1 expressing cells. HSP90, HSPA5, HSPA6, and phosphomevalonate kinase (of which the synthesis is also downregulated by dnHSF1) had no effect on peroxisomal refolding in either control or chaperone-depleted cells. The chaperone requirement for post-heat shock refolding of peroxisomal luciferase in control cells is thus unusual in that it can be augmented by DNAJB1 or HSPB1 but not by HSPA1A; in dnHSF1 expressing cells, expression of none of the (co)-chaperones tested was effective, and an as yet to be identified, HSF1-regulated function is required.

Abstract: Stem cells are tightly regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic signals as well as the extracellular matrix (ECM) for tissue homeostasis and regenerative capacity. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteolytic enzymes, modulate the turnover of numerous substrates, including cytokine precursors, growth factors, and ECM molecules. However, the roles of MMPs in the regulation of adult stem cells are poorly understood. In the present study, we utilize the Drosophila midgut, which is an excellent model system for studying stem cell biology, to show that Mmp1 is involved in the regulation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). The results showed that Mmp1 is expressed in the adult midgut and that its expression increases with age and with exposure to oxidative stress. Mmp1 knockdown or Timp-overexpressing flies and flies heterozygous for a viable, hypomorphic Mmp1 allele increased ISC proliferation in the gut, as shown by staining with an anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody and BrdU incorporation assays. Reduced Mmp1 levels induced intestinal hyperplasia, and the Mmp1depletion-induced ISC proliferation was rescued by the suppression of the EGFR signaling pathway, suggesting that Mmp1 regulates ISC proliferation through the EGFR signaling pathway. Furthermore, adult gut-specific knockdown and whole-animal heterozygotes of Mmp1 increased additively sensitivity to paraquat-induced oxidative stress and shortened lifespan. Our data suggest that Drosophila Mmp1 is involved in the regulation of ISC proliferation for maintenance of gut homeostasis.

Abstract: The signaling pathways facilitating metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells are not fully understood. CD147 is a transmembrane glycoprotein known to induce cell migration and invasion. AGR2 is a secreted peptide also known to promote cell metastasis. Here we describe their importance in the migration and invasion of HNSCC cells (FADU and OSC-19) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, knockdown of CD147 or AGR2 decreased cellular proliferation, migration and invasion. In vivo, knockdown of CD147 or AGR2 expression decreased primary tumor growth as well as regional and distant metastasis.

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome in which there is a decrease of muscle mass and strength with aging. In age-related loss of muscle strength, there are numerous observations supporting the assertion that neural factors mediate muscle strength. A possible contributing cause may be that aging changes systemic extracellular heat shock protein (eHsp)72 activity. The present study was designed to assess the plasma levels of eHsp72 in elderly people and to investigate its potential interaction with components of sarcopenia. A total of 665 men and women participated in an official medical health examination and an integrated health examination, including psychological and physical fitness tests. Blood samples were assayed for levels of plasma Hsp72, serum C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor α, and regular biomedical parameters. We found that higher Hsp72 in plasma is associated with lower muscle mass, weaker grip strength, and slower walking speed, and may be a potential biomarker of sarcopenia in elderly people. This finding was supported by other results in the present study: (1) older age and shrinking body and lower hemoglobin levels, all of which characterize sarcopenia, were related to higher eHsp72 tertiles and (2) the ORs of the highest tertile of eHsp72 for the lowest tertiles of muscle mass, grip strength, and walking speed were 2.7, 2.6, and 1.8, respectively. These ORs were independent of age, sex, and the incidence of related diseases. Our results would reveal that eHsp72 in plasma is linked to sarcopenia factors and is a potential biomarker or predictor of sarcopenia.

Abstract: We analyzed the existence of lipid bodies (LBs) in the fast twitch rat flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) myofibers and found that these structures were scarce. However, isolation procedure of the myofibers, heath shock, viral infection or the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin induced formation of the LBs, which were stationary structures flanking Z lines. We next infected FDB myofibers with recombinant Semliki Forest virus expressing caveolin 3-yellow fluorescent protein (cav3-YFP) since this chimeric protein was targeted to the LBs facilitating their further analysis. Photobleaching experiments showed that the LBs recovered cav 3-YFP extremely slowly, indicating that they were not continuous with the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum. We found, however, that cav3-YFP could move from the LBs to the sarcolemma and this phenomenon was sensitive to Brefeldin A, suggesting that the chimeric protein could be returned from the LBs to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Abstract: Modern anti-HER2 antibody therapy tends to exploit a panel of different antibodies against different epitopes on the antigen. For this aim, nanobodies are very striking targeting agents and can be easily produced against any cell-specific membrane antigen. The oligoclonal nanobodies can be used to block more than one functional epitope on a target antigen and inhibit the generation of escape variants associated with cancer therapy. In this study, 12 nanobody clones selected from an immune camel library were examined for their ability to differ between tumor markers. These oligoclonal nanobodies targeted breast cancer cells better than each individual nanobody. In epitope mapping, several nanobodies overlapped in the epitope recognized by trastuzumab and some of the non-overlapping nanobodies could affect the binding of trastuzumab to HER2. This study demonstrates that the oligoclonal nanobodies are potential therapeutic tools that can be used instead of, or in combination with trastuzumab to assess tumor viability during treatment.

Abstract: Pluripotent cells are attached to the extracellular matrix (ECM) as they make cell fate decisions within the stem cell niche. Here we show that the ubiquitous ECM protein fibronectin is required for self-renewal decisions by cultured mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. Undifferentiated mES cells produce fibronectin and assemble a fibrillar matrix. Increasing the level of substrate fibronectin increased cell spreading and integrin receptor signaling through focal adhesion kinase, while concomitantly inducing the loss of Nanog and Oct4 self-renewal markers. Conversely, reducing fibronectin production by mES cells growing on a feeder-free gelatin substrate caused loss of cell adhesion, decreased integrin signaling, and decreased expression of self-renewal markers. These effects were reversed by providing the cells with exogenous fibronectin, thereby restoring adhesion to the gelatin substrate. Interestingly, mES cells do not adhere directly to the gelatin substrate, but rather adhere indirectly through gelatin-bound fibronectin, which facilitates self-renewal via its effects on cell adhesion. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of regulation of self-renewal by growth on a gelatin-coated surface. The effects of increasing or decreasing fibronectin levels show that self-renewal depends on an intermediate level of cell-fibronectin interactions. By providing cell adhesive signals that can act with other self-renewal factors to maintain mES cell pluripotency, fibronectin is therefore a necessary component of the self-renewal signaling pathway in culture.

Abstract: Growth and metastasis of solid tumors requires induction of angiogenesis to ensure the delivery of oxygen, nutrients and growth factors to rapidly dividing transformed cells. Through either mutations, hypoxia generated by cytoreductive therapies, or when a malignancy outgrows its blood supply, tumor cells undergo a change from an avascular to a neovascular phenotype, a transition mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcriptional regulators. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one example of a gene whose transcription is stimulated by HIF. VEGF plays a crucial role in promoting tumor growth and survival by stimulating new blood vessel growth in response to such stresses as chemotherapy or radiotherapy-induced hypoxia, and it therefore has become a tempting target for neutralizing antibodies in the treatment of advanced neoplasms. Emerging evidence has shown that the semaphorins, proteins originally associated with control of axonal growth and immunity, are regulated by changes in oxygen tension as well and may play a role in tumor-induced angiogenesis. Through the use of RNA interference, in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis assays and tumor xenograft experiments, we demonstrate that expression of semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D), which is under the control of the HIF-family of transcription factors, cooperates with VEGF to promote tumor growth and vascularity in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We use blocking antibodies to show that targeting SEMA4D function along with VEGF could represent a novel anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategy for the treatment of OSCC and other solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) encodes five type VII secretion systems, ESX-1 to ESX-5, most of which are associated with genes encoding PE/PPE proteins, named after their N-terminal Pro-Glu (PE) or Pro-Pro-Glu (PPE) motifs. Here, we describe the strong T cell immunogenicity of the ESX-5-encoded PE/PPE proteins, which share a large panel of cross-reactive CD4+ epitopes with substantial numbers of their ESX-5-nonassociated PE/PPE homologs. The immunogenicity of these numerous PE/PPE proteins is dependent on their export by a functional EccD5, the predicted transmembrane channel of the ESX-5 secretion apparatus. The Mtb Δppe25-pe19 mutant deleted for all ESX-5-associated pe and ppe genes, although highly attenuated in immunocompetent mice, remains able to induce immunity against the ESX-5-associated PE/PPE virulence factors, via cross-reactivity with their numerous homologs, and against the ESX-1 virulence factors ESAT-6/CFP-10. The Δppe25-pe19 strain is strongly protective against Mtb infection in mice and represents a potential antituberculosis vaccine candidate.

Abstract: Oligomeric association of human small heat shock proteins HspB1, HspB5, HspB6 and HspB8 was analyzed by means of size-exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation and chemical cross-linking. Wild-type HspB1 and Cys mutants of HspB5, HspB6 and HspB8 containing a single Cys residue in position homologous to that of Cys137 of human HspB1 were able to generate heterodimers cross-linked by disulfide bond. Cross-linked heterodimers between HspB1/HspB5, HspB1/HspB6 and HspB5/HspB6 were easily produced upon mixing, whereas formation of any heterodimers with participation of HspB8 was significantly less efficient. The size of heterooligomers formed by HspB1/HspB6 and HspB5/HspB6 was different from the size of the corresponding homooligomers. Disulfide cross-linked homodimers of small heat shock proteins were unable to participate in heterooligomer formation. Thus, monomers can be involved in subunit exchange leading to heterooligomer formation and restriction of flexibility induced by disulfide cross-linking prevents subunit exchange.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium parasites multiply within host erythrocytes, which contain high levels of iron, and parasite egress from these cells results in iron release and host anemia. Although Plasmodium requires host iron for replication, how host iron homeostasis and responses to these fluxes affect Plasmodium infection are incompletely understood. We determined that Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), a host protein that sequesters iron, is abundantly secreted during human (P. vivax) and mouse (P. yoeliiNL) blood-stage malaria infections and is essential to control P. yoeliiNL parasitemia, anemia, and host survival. During infection, Lcn2 bolsters both host macrophage function and granulocyte recruitment and limits reticulocytosis, or the expansion of immature erythrocytes, which are the preferred target cell of P. yoeliiNL. Additionally, a chronic iron imbalance due to Lcn2 deficiency results in impaired adaptive immune responses against Plasmodium parasites. Thus, Lcn2 exerts antiparasitic effects by maintaining iron homeostasis and promoting innate and adaptive immune responses.

Abstract: Induction of heat shock proteins (Hsp) 72 and 27 can improve insulin signalling in obesity and type 2 diabetes via inhibition of key stress kinases. In metabolic disease, altered insulin signalling, as illustrated by increased serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 (Ser312), is not confined to muscle or liver and can also affect other tissues and cell types, potentially impairing their primary biological function. This study specifically investigated insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in monocytes and examined the impact of HSP induction on insulin signalling. Control (CG, BMI < 25 kg/m2) or obese (OG, BMI > 30 kg/m2) participants were included in the study. Glucose transporter (GLUT)4 expression on monocytes, phosphorylated JNK, IKK-β and IRS-1, as well as Hsp27 and Hsp72, were measured in monocytes under fasting conditions. GLUT4 expression was also measured during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). HSP induction as well as JNK, IKK-β activation and IRS-1 serine phosphorylation was investigated following heat stress. Obese patients showed lower GLUT4 levels on monocytes during the OGTT. pJNK, pIKK-β and pIRS-1 levels were increased in OG with pJNK and pIKK-β levels positively correlated with serine pIRS-1 and negatively with GLUT4 supporting their role in insulin resistance. Heat exposure induced Hsp72 and Hps27, but only in CG for the latter, and decreased pJNK, pIKK-β and pIRS-1. Our results show that induction of Hsp72 and 27 via heat stress is associated with inactivation of stress kinases and reduced serine pIRS-1 in monocytes from obese participants. This indicates that metabolic diseases can also affect monocyte metabolism via cellular stress that can be modulated via HSP induction.

Abstract: Summary
The human SAMHD1 protein potently restricts lentiviral infection in dendritic cells and monocyte/macrophages but is antagonized by the primate lentiviral protein Vpx, which targets SAMHD1 for degradation. However, only two of eight primate lentivirus lineages encode Vpx, whereas its paralog, Vpr, is conserved across all extant primate lentiviruses. We find that not only multiple Vpx but also some Vpr proteins are able to degrade SAMHD1, and such antagonism led to dramatic positive selection of SAMHD1 in the primate subfamily Cercopithecinae. Residues that have evolved under positive selection precisely determine sensitivity to Vpx/Vpr degradation and alter binding specificity. By overlaying these functional analyses on a phylogenetic framework of Vpr and Vpx evolution, we can decipher the chronology of acquisition of SAMHD1-degrading abilities in lentiviruses. We conclude that vpr neofunctionalized to degrade SAMHD1 even prior to the birth of a separate vpx gene, thereby initiating an evolutionary arms race with SAMHD1.

Abstract: Conditioning protocols involving mechanical stress independently or with chemical cues such as growth factors (GFs) possess significant potential to enhance bone regeneration. However, utilization of thermal stress conditioning alone or with GFs for bone therapy has been under-investigated. In this study, a preosteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1) was exposed to treatment with water bath heating (44°C, 4 and 8 min) and osteoinductive GFs (bone morphogenetic protein-2 and transforming growth factor-β1) individually or in combination to investigate whether these stimuli could promote induction of bone-related markers, an angiogenic factor, and heat shock proteins (HSPs). Cells remained viable when heating durations were less than 20 min at 40ºC, 16 min at 42ºC, and 10 min at 44ºC. Increasing heating duration at 44°C, promoted gene expression of HSPs, osteocalcin (OCN), and osteopontin (OPN) at 8 h post-heating (PH). Heating in combination with GFs caused the greatest gene induction of osteoprotegerin (OPG; 6.9- and 1.6-fold induction compared to sham-treated and GF only treated groups, respectively) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 16.0- and 1.6-fold compared to sham and GF-only treated groups, respectively) at 8 h PH. Both heating and GFs independently suppressed the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gene. GF treatment caused a more significant decrease in MMP-9 protein secretion to non-detectable levels compared to heating alone at 72 h PH. Secretion of OCN, OPN, and OPG increased with the addition of GFs but diminished with heating as measured by ELISA at 72 h PH. These results suggest that conditioning protocols utilizing heating and GFs individually or in combination can induce HSPs, bone-related proteins, and VEGF while also causing downregulation of osteoclastic activity, potentially providing a promising bone therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that Ca2+ overload is one of the major contributors of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury. Since Frizzled-2 receptor, a seven transmembrane protein, transduces downstream signaling by specialized binding of Wnt5a to increase intracellular Ca2+ release, this work aimed to investigate the effect of Frizzled-2 on Ca2+ accumulation in H9c2 cells, which were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation to mimic myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. After exposing H9c2 cells to hypoxia/reoxygenation, we observed higher expression of Frizzled-2 and Wnt5a as compared to control group cells. Hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced intracellular Ca2+ accumulation approached that of cells transfected with frizzled-2 plasmid. In cells treated with RNAi specifically designed against frizzled-2, intracellular Ca2+ in both hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated cells and plasmid-treated cells were decreased. Rats that underwent ischemia/reperfusion injury exhibited increased intracellular Ca2+ with high expression levels of Frizzled-2 and Wnt5a as compared to the sham group. Our data indicates that upon binding to Wnt5a, increased Frizzled-2 expression after hypoxia/reoxygenation treatment activated intracellular calcium release in H9c2 cells. Our findings provide a new perspective in understanding calcium overload in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion.

Abstract: Cell signaling often causes changes in cellular mechanical properties. Knowledge of such changes can ultimately lead to insight into the complex network of cell signaling. In the current study, we employed a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to characterize the mechanical behavior of A431 cells in response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. From AFM, which probes the upper portion of an individual cell in a monolayer of cells, we observed increases in energy dissipation, Young's modulus, and hysteresivity. Increases in hysteresivity imply a shift toward a more fluid-like mechanical ordering state in the bodies of the cells. From QCM-D, which probes the basal area of the monolayer of cells collectively, we observed decreases in energy dissipation factor. This result suggests a shift toward a more solid-like state in the basal areas of the cells. The comparative analysis of these results indicates a regionally specific mechanical behavior of the cell in response to EGFR signaling and suggests a correlation between the time-dependent mechanical responses and the dynamic process of EGFR signaling. This study also demonstrates that a combination of AFM and QCM-D is able to provide a more complete and refined mechanical profile of the cells during cell signaling.

Abstract: Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and an important contributor to tumor radioresistance. miR-210 is the most consistently and robustly induced microRNA under hypoxia in different types of tumor cells and normal cells. In the present study, to explore the feasibility of miR-210 as an effective therapeutic target, lentiviral-mediated anti-sense miR-210 gene transfer technique was employed to downregulate miR-210 expression in hypoxic human hepatoma SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HuH7 cells, and phenotypic changes of which were analyzed. Hypoxia led to an increased hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and miR-210 expression and cell arrest in the G0/G1 phase in all cell lines. miR-210 downregulation significantly suppressed cell viability, induced cell arrest in the G0/G1 phase, increased apoptotic rate and enhanced radiosensitivity in hypoxic human hepatoma cells. Moreover, apoptosis-inducing factor, mitochondrion-associated, 3 (AIFM3) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-210. AIFM3 downregulation by siRNA attenuated radiation induced apoptosis in miR-210 downregulated hypoxic human hepatoma cells. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-210 might be a potential therapeutic target and specific inhibition of miR-210 expression in combination with radiotherapy might be expected to exert strong anti-tumor effect on hypoxic human hepatoma cells.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is one of the major MMPs that can degrade extracellular matrix. Besides normal physiological functions, MMP-9 is involved in metastasis and tumor angiogenesis. Although several inhibitors of MMP-9 have been identified, in vivo regulators of MMP-9 activation are unknown. In the present study we intended to investigate novel therapeutic target protein(s) that regulate MMP-9 activation and/or secretion. We have identified protein disulfide isomerase as a novel upstream regulator of MMP-9. Mass spectrometric analysis of post-translational modification in MMP-9 confirmed six disulfide bonds in the catalytic domain and one disulfide bond in the hemopexin domain of MMP-9. Establishment of cells that overexpressed wild-type and mutant forms of MMP-9 revealed that ‘cysteine-switch’ and disulfide bonds within the catalytic domain are necessary for the secretion and intracellular trafficking of MMP-9. However, the disulfide bond of the hemopexin domain and other cysteines have no significant role in secretion. These insights into the secretion of MMP-9 constitute the basis for the development of potential drugs against metastasis.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays an important role in the outgrowth of expanded human limbal epithelial cells on intact amniotic membranes (AM). The mechanisms of MMP-9 expression and cell outgrowth remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that MMP-9 is preferentially expressed at the leading edge of limbal epithelial outgrowth. Treatment with the inhibitors of PI3-K (LY294002), Akt (SH-5), MEK1/2 (U0126), and JNK1/2 (SP600125) attenuated the outgrowth area, indicating that PI3-K/Akt, p42/p44 MAPK, and JNK1/2 are involved in the outgrowth of intact AM-expanded limbal epithelial cells. However, MMP-9 expression at both transcriptional and translational levels was attenuated by treatment with SP600125, LY294002, or SH-5, not by U0126 and SB202190, suggesting that JNK1/2 and PI3-K/Akt participate in MMP-9 expression. Moreover, NF-κB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation was especially noted at the leading edge, which was attenuated by treatment with SP600125 or LY294002. Helenalin, a selective NF-κB inhibitor, reduced both the limbal epithelial outgrowth and MMP-9 expression. Finally, the data reveal that PI3-K/Akt is an upstream component of the JNK1/2 pathway in MMP-9 expression. Thus, both MAPKs and PI3-K/Akt are required for limbal epithelial outgrowth on intact AM, only the PI3-K/Akt/JNK is essential for MMP-9 expression mediated through activation of transcriptional factor NF-κB in this model.

Abstract: Inhibitors of protein deacetylases represent a novel therapeutic option for cancer diseases due to their effects on transcriptional regulation by interfering with histones acetylation and on several other cellular pathways. Recently, their ability to modulate several transcription factors and, interestingly, also co-factors, which actively participate in formation and modulation of transcription complexes was shown. We here investigate whether HMGA2 (High Mobility Group AT-2 hook), a nuclear non-histone transcriptional co-factor with known oncogenic properties, can be influenced by the novel pan-deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) in human hepatocellular carcinoma models. Panobinostat strongly downregulated HMGA2 in HepG2 and Hep3B cells; this effect was mediated by transcriptional upregulation and promotion of the maturation of the tumorsuppressor miRNA hsa-let-7b, which could inhibit HMGA2 expression via RNA interference pathways. siRNA knockdown of HMGA2 or transfection of hsa-let-7b mimicking oligonucleotides confirmed the role of HMGA2 in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis in liver cancer cell lines. Co-incubation with panobinostat showed an additive effect on inhibition of cell proliferation using an impedance-based real-time cell analyzer. Treatment of HepG2 xenografts with panobinostat also led to a downregulation of HMGA2 in vivo. These findings show that pan-deacetylase inhibitors also modulate other signaling pathways and networks than histone modifications to influence cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria move between cells in the epithelium using a sequential pseudopodium-mediated process but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We show that during cell-to-cell movement, Shigella-containing pseudopodia target epithelial tricellular junctions, the contact point where three epithelial cells meet. The bacteria-containing pseudopodia were engulfed by neighboring cells only in the presence of tricellulin, a protein essential for tricellular junction integrity. Shigella cell-to-cell spread, but not pseudopodium protrusion, also depended on phosphoinositide 3-kinase, clathrin, Epsin-1, and Dynamin-2, which localized beneath the plasma membrane of the engulfing cell. Depleting tricellulin, Epsin-1, clathrin, or Dynamin-2 expression reduced Shigella cell-to-cell spread, whereas AP-2, Dab2, and Eps15 were not critical for this process. Our findings highlight a mechanism for Shigella dissemination into neighboring cells via targeting of tricellular junctions and a noncanonical clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway.

Abstract: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation has emerged as a promising therapy, but it is challenged by scarcity of stem cells. Eltrombopag is a non-peptide, thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist, which selectively activates c-Mpl in humans and chimpanzees. We investigated eltrombopag's effects on human UCB hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) expansion, and its effects on hematopoiesis in vivo. Eltrombopag selectively augmented the expansion of human CD45+, CD34+, and CD41+ cells in bone marrow compartment without effects on mouse bone marrow cells in the NOD/SCID mice xenotransplant model. Consequently, eltrombopag increased peripheral human platelets and white blood cells. We further examined effects in the STAT and AKT signaling pathways in serum-free cultures. Eltrombopag expanded human CD34+ CD38−, CD34+, and CD41+ cells. Both eltrombopag and recombinant human TPO (rhTPO) induced phosphorylation of STAT5 of CD34+ CD41−, CD34− CD41+, and CD34− CD41− cells. rhTPO preferentially induced pSTAT3, pAKT, and more pSTAT5 in CD34− C41+ cells, while eltrombopag had no effects on pSTAT3. In conclusion, eltrombopag enhanced expansion of HSCs/HPCs of human UCB in vivo and in vitro, and promoted multi-lineage hematopoiesis through the expansion of bone marrow HSCs/HPCs of human UCB in vivo. Eltrombopag differed somewhat from rhTPO in the signal transduction pathways by favoring earlier HSC/HPC populations.

Abstract: Although head and neck squamous carcinoma cancer stem cells (HNSC-CSCs) can be enriched in serum-free suspension cultures, it is difficult to stably expand HNSC-CSC lines in suspension due to spontaneous apoptosis and differentiation. Here, we investigated whether HNSC-CSCs can be expanded without loss of stem cell properties by adherent culture methods. Cell culture plates were coated with type IV collagen, laminin, or fibronectin. We examined cancer stem cell traits of adherent HNSC-CSCs grown on these plates using immunocytochemistry for stem cell marker expression and analyses of chemo-resistance and xenograft tumorigenicity. We also assessed the growth rate, apoptosis rate, and gene transduction efficiency of adherent and suspended HNSC-CSCs. HNSC-CSCs grew much faster on type IV collagen-coated plates than in suspension. Adherent HNSC-CSCs expressed putative stem cell markers (OCT4 and CD44) and were chemo-resistant to various cytotoxic drugs (cisplatin, fluorouracil, paclitaxel, and docetaxel). Adherent HNSC-CSCs at the limiting dilution (1000 cells) produced tumors in nude mice. Adherent HNSC-CSCs also showed less spontaneous apoptotic cell death and were more competent to lentiviral transduction than suspended HNSC-CSCs. In conclusion, compared to suspension cultures, adherence on type IV collagen-coated culture plates provides better experimental conditions for HNSC-CSC expansion, which should facilitate various refined cellular studies.

Abstract: Neuregulin1 is a family of growth and differentiation factors involved in various functions of both peripheral and central nervous system including the regenerative processes that underlie regeneration of damaged peripheral nerves. In the present study we tested in vitro the effect of Neuregulin1 administration on dissociated rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Activity of neuregulin1 was compared to the activity of nerve growth factor in the same in vitro experimental model. Results showed that neurite outgrowth is enhanced by the addition of both neuregulin1 and nerve growth factor to the culture medium. While neuregulin1 was responsible for the growth of longer neurites, DRG neurons incubated with nerve growth factor showed shorter and more branched axons. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we also showed that the release of nerve growth factor, but not of brain derived neurotrophic factor is improved in DRG neuron treated with neuregulin1. On the other hand, the assay with growth factor blocking antibody, showed that effects exerted by neuregulin1 on neurite outgrowth is only partially due to the release of nerve growth factor. Taken together the results of this study provide a better understanding on the role of neuregulin1 in sensory neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Upon infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) metabolically alters the macrophage to create a niche that is ideally suited to its persistent lifestyle. Infected macrophages acquire a “foamy” phenotype characterized by the accumulation of lipid bodies (LBs), which serve as both a source of nutrients and a secure niche for the bacterium. While the functional significance of the foamy phenotype is appreciated, the biochemical pathways mediating this process are understudied. We found that Mtb induces the foamy phenotype via targeted manipulation of host cellular metabolism to divert the glycolytic pathway toward ketone body synthesis. This dysregulation enabled feedback activation of the anti-lipolytic G protein-coupled receptor GPR109A, leading to perturbations in lipid homeostasis and consequent accumulation of LBs in the macrophage. ESAT-6, a secreted Mtb virulence factor, mediates the enforcement of this feedback loop. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological targeting of pathways mediating this host-pathogen metabolic crosstalk provides a potential strategy for developing tuberculosis chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
In response to virus infection, cells can alter protein expression to modify cellular functions and limit viral replication. To examine host protein expression during infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), an enveloped DNA virus, we performed a semiquantitative, temporal analysis of the cell surface proteome in infected fibroblasts. We determined that resident low density lipoprotein related receptor 1 (LRP1), a plasma membrane receptor that regulates lipid metabolism, is elevated early after HCMV infection, resulting in decreased intracellular cholesterol. siRNA knockdown or antibody-mediated inhibition of LRP1 increased intracellular cholesterol and concomitantly increased the infectious virus yield. Virions produced under these conditions contained elevated cholesterol, resulting in increased infectivity. Depleting cholesterol from virions reduced their infectivity by blocking fusion of the virion envelope with the cell membrane. Thus, LRP1 restricts HCMV infectivity by controlling the availability of cholesterol for the virion envelope, and increased LRP1 expression is likely a defense response to infection.

Abstract: Summary
Asexual stage Plasmodium falciparum replicates and undergoes a tightly regulated developmental process in human erythrocytes. One mechanism involved in the regulation of this process is posttranslational modification (PTM) of parasite proteins. Palmitoylation is a PTM in which cysteine residues undergo a reversible lipid modification, which can regulate target proteins in diverse ways. Using complementary palmitoyl protein purification approaches and quantitative mass spectrometry, we examined protein palmitoylation in asexual-stage P. falciparum parasites and identified over 400 palmitoylated proteins, including those involved in cytoadherence, drug resistance, signaling, development, and invasion. Consistent with the prevalence of palmitoylated proteins, palmitoylation is essential for P. falciparum asexual development and influences erythrocyte invasion by directly regulating the stability of components of the actin-myosin invasion motor. Furthermore, P. falciparum uses palmitoylation in diverse ways, stably modifying some proteins while dynamically palmitoylating others. Palmitoylation therefore plays a central role in regulating P. falciparum blood stage development.

Abstract: α-Crystallin-type small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are expressed in many bacteria, animals, plants, and archaea. Among mycoplasmas (Mollicutes), predicted sHsp homologues so far were found only in the Acholeplasmataceae family. In this report, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of a novel sHsp orthologue, IbpA protein, present in Acholeplasma laidlawii. Importantly, similar to the endogenously expressed sHsp proteins, the recombinant IbpA protein was able to spontaneously generate oligomers in vitro and to rescue chemically denatured bovine insulin from irreversible denaturation and aggregation. Collectively, these data suggest that IbpA is a bona fide member of the sHsps family. The immune-electron microscopy data using specific antibodies against IbpA have revealed different intracellular localization of this protein in A. laidlawii cells upon heat shock, which suggests that IbpA not only may participate in the stabilization of individual polypeptides, but may also play a protective role in the maintenance of various cellular structures upon temperature stress.

Abstract: Summary
Apicomplexan parasites have an assortment of unique apical secretory organelles (rhoptries and micronemes), which have crucial functions in host infection. Here, we show that a Toxoplasma gondii sortilin-like receptor (TgSORTLR) is required for the subcellular localization and formation of apical secretory organelles. TgSORTLR is a transmembrane protein that resides within Golgi-endosomal related compartments. The lumenal domain specifically interacts with rhoptry and microneme proteins, while the cytoplasmic tail of TgSORTLR recruits cytosolic sorting machinery involved in anterograde and retrograde protein transport. Ectopic expression of the N-terminal TgSORTLR lumenal domain results in dominant negative effects with the mislocalization of both endogenous TgSORTLR as well as rhoptry and microneme proteins. Conditional ablation of TgSORTLR disrupts rhoptry and microneme biogenesis, inhibits parasite motility, and blocks both invasion into and egress from host cells. Thus, the sortilin-like receptor is essential for protein trafficking and the biogenesis of key secretory organelles in Toxoplasma.

Abstract: During cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells, an actomyosin-based contractile ring (CR) is assembled along the equator of the cell. Myosin II ATPase activity is stimulated by the phosphorylation of the myosin II regulatory light chain (MRLC) in vitro, and phosphorylated MRLC localizes at the CR in various types of cells. Previous studies have determined that phosphorylated MRLC plays an important role in CR furrowing. However, the role of phosphorylated MRLC in CR assembly remains unknown. Here, we have used confocal microscopy to observe dividing HeLa cells expressing fluorescent protein-tagged MRLC mutants and actin during CR assembly near the cortex. Di-phosphomimic MRLC accumulated at the cell equator earlier than non-phosphorylatable MRLC and actin. Interestingly, perturbation of myosin II activity by non-phosphorylatable MRLC expression or treatment with blebbistatin, a myosin II inhibitor, did not alter the time of actin accumulation at the cell equator. Furthermore, inhibition of actin polymerization by treatment with latrunculin A had no effect on MRLC accumulation at the cell equator. Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylated MRLC temporally controls its own accumulation, but not that of actin, in cultured mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Acute oncogenic stress can activate autophagy and facilitate permanent arrest of the cell cycle through a failsafe mechanism known as oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) proteins are known to subvert autophagic pathways, but the link to Kaposi's sarcoma pathogenesis is unclear. We find that oncogenic assault caused by latent KSHV infection elicits DNA damage responses (DDRs) characteristic of OIS, yet infected cells display only modest levels of autophagy and fail to senesce. These aberrant responses result from the combined activities of tandemly expressed KSHV v-cyclin and v-FLIP proteins. v-Cyclin deregulates the cell cycle, triggers DDRs, and if left unchecked can promote autophagy and senescence. However, during latency v-FLIP blocks v-cyclin-induced autophagy and senescence in a manner that requires intact v-FLIP ATG3-binding domains. Together, these data reveal a coordinated viral gene expression program that usurps autophagy, blocks senescence, and facilitates the proliferation of KSHV-infected cells.

Abstract: Zymogen granules (ZG) are specialized organelles in the exocrine pancreas which allow digestive enzyme storage and regulated secretion. To investigate ZG biogenesis, cargo sorting and packaging, suitable cellular model systems are required. Here, we demonstrate that granule formation in pancreatic AR42J cells, an acinar model system, can be modulated by altering the growth conditions in cell culture. We find that cultivation of AR42J cells in Panserin™ 401, a serum-free medium, enhances the induction of granule formation in the presence or absence of dexamethasone when compared to standard conditions including serum. Biochemical and morphological studies revealed an increase in ZG markers on the mRNA and protein level, as well as in granule size compared to standard conditions. Our data indicate that this effect is related to pronounced differentiation of AR42J cells. To address if enhanced expression of ZG proteins promotes granule formation, we expressed several zymogens and ZG membrane proteins in unstimulated AR42J cells and in constitutively secreting COS-7 cells. Neither single expression nor co-expression was sufficient to initiate granule formation in AR42J cells or the formation of granule-like structures in COS-7 cells as described for neuroendocrine cargo proteins. The importance of our findings for granule formation in exocrine cells is discussed.

Abstract: Chemoprevention would be a desirable strategy to avoid duodenectomy in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) suffering from duodenal adenomatosis. We investigated the in vitro effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and COX-2 expression of the potential chemopreventives celecoxib and tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). HT-29 colon cancer cells and LT97 colorectal micro-adenoma cells derived from a patient with FAP, were exposed to low dose celecoxib and UDCA alone or in combination with tauro-cholic acid (CA) and tauro-chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), mimicking bile of FAP patients treated with UDCA. In HT-29 cells, co-treatment with low dose celecoxib and UDCA resulted in a decreased cell growth (14–17%, p<0.01). A more pronounced decrease (23–27%, p<0.01) was observed in LT97 cells. Cell growth of HT-29 cells exposed to ‘artificial bile’ enriched with UDCA, was decreased (p<0.001), either in the absence or presence of celecoxib. In LT97 cells incubated with ‘artificial bile’ enriched with UDCA, cell growth was decreased only in the presence of celecoxib (p<0.05). No clear evidence was found for involvement of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, caspase-3, or COX-2 in the cellular processes leading to the observed changes in cell growth. In conclusion, co-treatment with low dose celecoxib and UDCA has growth inhibitory effects on colorectal adenoma cells derived from a patient with FAP, and further research on this combination as promising chemopreventive strategy is desired.

Abstract: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoactive peptide which signals through two G-protein coupled receptors, endothelin receptor A (ETA) and B (ETB). We determined that ET-1 activation of its ETB receptor in stably cDNA transfected CHO cells leads to a 55% reduction in cell number by end-point cell counting and a 35% decrease in cell growth by a real-time cell-substrate impedance-based assay after 24h of cell growth. When CHO ETB cells were synchronized in the late G1 cell cycle phase, ET-1 delayed their S phase progression compared to control by 30% as determined by [3H]-thymidine incorporation. On the other hand, no such delay was observed during late G2/M to G1 transit when cells were treated with ET-1 after release from mitotic arrest. Using the cell-substrate impedance-based assay, we observed that ET-1 induces opposing morphological changes in CHO ETA and CHO ETB cells with ETB causing an increase in the cell footprint and ETA a decrease. Likewise, in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, which express both ETA and ETB receptors, ET-1 induces an ETA-dependent contraction and an ETB dependent dilation. These results are shedding light on a possible beneficial role for ETB in diseases involving ET-1 dysfunction such as pulmonary hypertension.

Abstract: Accumulation of extracellular matrix including fibronectin in mesangium is one of the major pathologic characteristics in diabetic nephropathy. In the current study, we explored role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor in fibronectin expression and underlying molecular mechanism. Among five S1P receptors the mRNA level of S1P2 receptor was the most abundant in kidney of diabetic rats and mesangial cells under high glucose condition. S1P augmentation of fibronectin was significantly inhibited by S1P2 receptor antagonist JTE-013 and S1P2-siRNA. S1P-stimulated fibronectin expression was remarkably blocked by ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-p38MAPK level induced by S1P were markedly abrogated by JTE-013 and S1P2-siRNA. In conclusion, S1P2 receptor was significantly up-regulated under diabetic condition. S1P2 receptor mediated fibronectin expression through the activation of S1P-S1P2-MAPK (ERK1/2 and p38MAPK) axis in mesangial cells under high glucose condition, suggesting that it might be a potential therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy treatment.

Abstract: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) is shown to be a potential marker for poor prognosis in breast cancer, but the biology of TIMP-1 is only partially understood. In this study, TIMP-1 production was studied in a co-culture model of hormone-independent breast cancer cell lines and mesenchymal stem cells mimicking the stromal components of the tumor. In addition, the prognostic value of TIMP-1 was histologically evaluated in a clinical material of 168 patients with hormone-independent breast tumors. The hormone-independent breast cancer (BC) cell lines MDA-MB-231, M4A4 and NM2C5 did not produce TIMP-1 protein in measureable quantities. Six tested primary mesenchymal stem cell lines all produced TIMP-1. Co-culturing of mesenchymal stem cells and breast cancer cells resulted in positive immunocytochemical diffuse staining for TIMP-1 for both cell types. Culturing breast cancer cells with MSC-conditioned media resulted in a positive cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for TIMP-1, and TIMP-1 protein concentration in cell lysates increased 2.7-fold (range 1.1–4.7). The TIMP-1 mRNA levels remained unaffected in BC cells. This might suggest that breast cancer cells can take up TIMP-1 produced by stromal cells and are thus displaying cellular immunoreactivity. In addition, TIMP-1 was shown to improve stratification of prognosis in clinical material.

Abstract: Adult mesenchymal stem cells have self-renewal and multiple differentiation potentials, and play important roles in regenerative medicine. However, their use may be limited by senescence or age of the donor, leading to changes in stem cell functionality. We investigated morphological, molecular and functional differences between bone marrow-derived (MSC) and adipose-derived (ASC) stem cells isolated from neonatal, young and old rats compared to Schwann cells from the same animals. Immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR, proliferation assays, western blotting and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate expression of senescence markers. Undifferentiated and differentiated ASC and MSC from animals of different ages expressed Notch-2 at similar levels; protein-38 and protein-53 were present in all groups of cells with a trend towards increased levels in cells from older animals compared to those from neonatal and young rats. Following co-culture with adult neuronal cells, dMSC and dASC from animals of all ages elicited robust neurite outgrowth. Mitotracker® staining was consistent with ultrastructural changes seen in the mitochondria of cells from old rats, indicative of senescence. In conclusion, this study showed that although the cells from aged animals expressed markers of senescence, aged MSC and ASC differentiated into SC-like cells still retain potential to support axon regeneration.

Abstract: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) hold great potential for replacing neurons following injury or disease. The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of ESCs may be hindered by heterogeneity in ESC-derived populations. Drug selection has been used to purify ESC-derived cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells but has not been applied to specific neural lineages. In this study we investigated positive selection of progenitor motor neurons (pMNs) through transgenic expression of the puromycin resistance enzyme, puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (PAC), under the Olig2 promoter. The protein-coding region in one allele of Olig2 was replaced with PAC to generate the P-Olig2 cell line. This cell line provided specific puromycin resistance in cells that express Olig2, while Olig2− cells were killed by puromycin. Positive selection significantly enriched populations of Olig2+ pMNs. Committed motoneurons (MNs) expressing Hb9, a common progeny of pMNs, were also enriched by the end of the selection period. Selected cells remained viable and differentiated into mature cholinergic MNs and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Drug resistance may provide a scalable and inexpensive method for enriching desired neural cell types for use in research applications.

Abstract: Multiple signalling pathways maintain human embryonic stem cells (hESC) in an undifferentiated state. Here we sought to define the significance of G protein signal transduction in the preservation of this state distinct from other cellular processes. Continuous treatment with drugs targeting Gαs-, Gα-i/o- and Gα-q/11-subunit signalling mediators were assessed in independent hESC lines after 7days to discern effects on normalised alkaline phosphatase positive colony frequency vs total cell content. This identified PLCβ, intracellular free calcium and CAMKII kinase activity downstream of Gα-q/11 as of particular importance to the former. To confirm the significance of this finding we generated an agonist-responsive hESC line transgenic for a Gα-q/11 subunit-coupled receptor and demonstrated that an undifferentiated state could be promoted in the presence of an agonist without exogenously supplied bFGF and that this correlated with elevated intracellular calcium. Similarly, treatment of unmodified hESCs with a range of intracellular free calcium-modulating drugs in biologically defined mTESR culture system lacking exogenous bFGF promoted an hESC phenotype after 1week of continuous culture as defined by co-expression of OCT4 and NANOG. At least one of these drugs, lysophosphatidic acid significantly elevates phosphorylation of calmodulin and STAT3 in this culture system (p<0.05). These findings substantiate a role for G-protein and calcium signalling in undifferentiated hESC culture.

Abstract: Background
The early- to mid-term impact of bone-marrow-derived stem cells (BMC) on diastolic function and exercise capacity after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains controversial. We performed a systematic analysis to assess whether BMC transfer is related to an early improvement in diastolic function and exercise capacity after AMI.
Methods
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of BMC therapy after AMI were extracted from MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL and analyzed for a change in tissue Doppler annular early (Ea) and late diastolic (Aa) velocities, mitral inflow E velocity to tissue Doppler Ea (E/Ea) ratio, exercise time and exercise capacity.
Results
A total of 365 patients were included from 6 trials. A greater improvement was observed in the E/Ea ratio after 1year in the BMC group compared to the control group. Additionally, the BMC-treated patients had a larger improvement in exercise time, ventilation/CO2 production (VE/VCO2 slope) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) after 1year.
Conclusion
The results indicate that intracoronary BMC treatment in AMI patients leads to a mid-term improvement in diastolic function and exercise capacity.

Abstract: Summary
Host resistance to viral infection requires type I (α/β) and II (γ) interferon (IFN) production. Another important defense mechanism is the degradative activity of macroautophagy (herein autophagy), mediated by the coordinated action of evolutionarily conserved autophagy proteins (Atg). We show that the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 protein complex, whose prior known function is in autophagosome formation, is required for IFNγ-mediated host defense against murine norovirus (MNV) infection. Importantly, the direct antiviral activity of IFNγ against MNV in macrophages required Atg5-Atg12, Atg7, and Atg16L1, but not induction of autophagy, the degradative activity of lysosomal proteases, fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, or the Atg8-processing protein Atg4B. IFNγ, via Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1, inhibited formation of the membranous cytoplasmic MNV replication complex, where Atg16L1 localized. Thus, the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 complex performs a pivotal, nondegradative role in IFNγ-mediated antiviral defense, establishing that multicellular organisms have evolved to use portions of the autophagy pathway machinery in a cassette-like fashion for host defense.

Abstract: A variety of ion channels like acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) and several members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel family are known to be activated by protons. The present study describes proton‐gated current in mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), by using whole cell patch clamp. Rapid application of extracellular solution of pH≤6.5, evoked slow inactivating current with mean peak value of 328±31pA, (n=25) at pH 5.0. The reversal potential was close to the theoretical Na+ equilibrium potential, indicating that majority of the current is mediated by Na+ and partially carried by Ca2+ as revealed by ion substitution experiments and Ca2+ imaging. ASICs blocker amiloride (1mM) and nonselective cation channel blocker flufenamic acid (0.3mM) reduced the current amplitudes by 36±5% (n=10) and 39±7% (n=14) respectively. Co-application of flufenamic acid and amiloride further decreased the current by 70±7% (n=7). However, capsazepine, SKF 96365 and ruthenium red had no effect. 10mM of Ca2+ and 2mM of La3+ inhibited the current by 39±6% (n=5) and 46±6% (n=4) respectively. Zn2+ (300μM) and Gd3+ (500μM) had no effect on the current amplitude. Low pH mediated cell death was completely inhibited by co-application of La3+ and amiloride. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR detected expression of mRNAs of ASICs and TRP family. In summary, our results demonstrate the functional expression of low pH‐activated ion channels in mouse BMSCs.

Abstract: Dysferlin mutations cause muscular dystrophy (dysferlinopathy) characterized by adult onset muscle weakness, high serum creatine kinase levels, attenuation of muscle regeneration and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate. In order to verify the role of lymphocytes and immune cells on this disease, we generated the Scid/A/J transgenic mice and compared these animals with the age-matched A/J mice. The absence of T and B lymphocytes in this animal model of dysferlinopathy resulted in an improvement of the muscle regeneration. Scid/A/J mice showed increased specific force in the myosin heavy chain 2A-expressing fibers of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles. Moreover, a partial reduction in complement deposition was observed together with a diminution in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages. Consistent with this model, T and B lymphocytes seem to have a role in the muscle damaging immune response. The knowledge of the involvement of immune system in the development of dysferlinopathies could represent an important tool for their rescuing. By studying Scid/blAJ mice, we showed that it could be possible to modulate the pathological symptoms of these diseases by interfering with different components of the immune system.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal microbiota has been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and oral treatment with specific bacteria can ameliorate IBD. One bacterial mixture, VSL#3, containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus, was clinically shown to reduce inflammation in IBD patients and normalize intestinal levels of IP-10, a lymphocyte-recruiting chemokine, in a murine colitis model. We identified Lactobacillus paracasei prtP-encoded lactocepin as a protease that selectively degrades secreted, cell-associated, and tissue-distributed IP-10, resulting in significantly reduced lymphocyte recruitment after intraperitoneal injection in an ileitis model. A human Lactobacillus casei isolate was also found to encode lactocepin and degrade IP-10. L. casei feeding studies in a murine colitis model (T cell transferred Rag2−/− mice) revealed that a prtP-disruption mutant was significantly less potent in reducing IP-10 levels, T cell infiltration and inflammation in cecal tissue compared to the isogenic wild-type strain. Thus, lactocepin-based therapies may be effective treatments for chemokine-mediated diseases like IBD.

Abstract: Summary
Antimicrobial peptides are constituents of the first-line innate mucosal defense system that acts as a barrier to establishment of infection. The highly successful human gastric pathogen, Helicobacter pylori, is able to persistently colonize its host despite inducing expression of several antimicrobial peptides, including human β-defensin 3 (hBD3). We find that hBD3 is highly active against H. pylori in vitro and is rapidly induced during early infection via EGFR-dependent activation of MAP kinase and JAK/STAT signaling. However, during prolonged infection, hBD3 was subsequently downregulated by the H. pylori virulence determinant CagA. Upon translocation into host cells, CagA activated the cellular tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, terminating EGFR activation and downstream signaling and increasing bacterial viability. Chemical inhibition and knockdown of SHP-2 expression rescued hBD3 synthesis and bactericidal activity. Thus, we reveal how cagPAI-positive H. pylori strains use CagA to evade a key innate mucosal defense pathway to support the establishment of persistent infection.

Abstract: Morphological, qualitative observations allow pathologists to correlate the shape the cells acquire with the progressive, underlying neoplastic transformation they are experienced. Cell morphology, indeed, roughly scales with malignancy. A quantitative parameter for characterizing complex irregular structures is the Normalized Bending Energy (NBE). NBE provides a global feature for shape characterization correspondent to the amount of energy needed to transform the specific shape under analysis into its lowest energy state. We hypothesized that a chemotherapy resistant cancer cell line would experience a significant change in its shape, and that such a modification might be quantified by means of NBE parameterization. We checked out the usefulness of a mathematical algorithm to distinguish wild and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant colon cancer HCT-8 cells (HCT-8FUres). NBE values, as well as cellular and molecular parameters, were recorded in both cell populations. Results demonstrated that acquisition of drug resistance is accompanied by statistically significant morphological changes in cell membrane, as well as in biological parameters. Namely, NBE increased progressively meanwhile cells become more resistant to increasing 5-FU concentrations. These data indicate how tight the relationships between morphology and phenotype is, and they support the idea to follow a cell transition toward a drug-resistant phenotype by means of morphological monitoring.

Abstract: We have investigated the ability of optical oxygen sensors incorporated in a microplate to determine the respiratory activity of cell fractions. Different cell fractions were monitored, in particular to evaluate the long term functionality of isolated mitochondria. It is possible to continuously sense respiratory activity of isolated mitochondria over time. We found that they are functional for three hours but stop respiring at a critical limit of 20% air saturation in the system. Furthermore, inhibition and enhancement of respiratory activity were detected. In conclusion, oxygen sensors are a powerful tool to evaluate the functionality of isolated mitochondria.
