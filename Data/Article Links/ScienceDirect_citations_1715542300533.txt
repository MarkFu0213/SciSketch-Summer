Abstract: Fasudil is a clinically approved Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has been used widely to treat cerebral consequences of subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is known to have a positive effect on animal models of neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease and stroke. However, its cellular effect on progenitor populations and differentiation is not clearly understood. While recent studies suggest that fasudil promotes the mobilization of neural stem cells (NSCs) from the subventricular zone in vivo and promotes the differentiation of the C17.2 cerebellar neuroprogenitor line in vitro, it is unclear whether fasudil is involved in the differentiation of primary NSCs. Here, we tested the effect of fasudil on mouse NSCs in vitro, and observed increased gliogenesis in NSCs derived from lateral ventricles. Upon treatment, fasudil promoted characteristics of neurogenesis including phenotypic changes in neural outgrowth and interkinetic nuclear-like movements as an immediate response, while Sox2 expression was maintained and GFAP expression increased. Moreover, the gliogenic response to fasudil medium was observed in both early postnatal and adult NSC cultures. Taken together, our results show that fasudil promotes the differentiation of NSCs into astroglial lineage, suggesting that it could be used to develop novel vitro gliogenesis models and regulate differentiation for neural repair.

Abstract: Failure to eradicate hematologic cancer stem cells (hCSCs) associated with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib mesylate (IM) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients is a clinical challenge that highlights the need for discovering and developing therapeutic strategies that target and eliminate these hCSCs. Herein, we document the essential role of the interplay between histone deacetylases (HDACs), the polycomb group proteins, pluripotency transcription factors and the cell cycle machinery in the viability, oncogenicity and therapy evasion of IM-resistant CD34+/CD38- CML stem cells (CML-SCs). Using the proteotranscriptomic analyses of wild type (WT), CD34+/CD38+ and CD34+/CD38− K562 or KU812 cells, we showed that CD34+/CD38− SC-enriched cells expressed significantly higher levels of CD44, CD133, SOX2, Nanog, OCT4, and c-Myc mRNA and/or protein, compared to the WT or CD34+/CD38+ cells. This overexpression of stemness factors in the CD34+/CD38− cells positively correlates with enhanced expression of HDACs 1–6, cyclins D1/D3, CDK 2, 4 and 6, while inversely correlating with p18, p21 and p27. Enhanced co-expression of MDR1, survivin, and Bcl-2 proteins, supposedly involved in IM-resistance and CML-SC survival, was detected in both CD34+/CD38− and CD34+/CD38+ cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that in synergism with IM, SAHA reverses the tumor-promoting proteotranscriptomic profile noted above and elicits marked inhibition of the CML-SCs by up-regulating hsa-miR-196a expression. This hsa-miR-196a-mediated SC-limiting effect of SAHA is dose-dependent, low-dosed, cell cycle-modulating and accompanied by leukemic SC apoptosis. Interestingly, this anti-SC therapeutic activity of SAHA in vitro was reproduced in vivo using the NOD-SCID mice models.

Abstract: Chromosome 17p deletions (del(17p)) are present in about 11% of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients and related to inferior prognosis. Bortezomib (BTZ), the first proteasome inhibitor anticancer drug, has a good therapeutic effect for newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory MM, but is unable to improve the outcome of MM patients with del(17p). Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) PRAL is located on chromosome 17p, and is associated with the progression and prognosis of different types of cancers. However, little is known about its role in MM. Here, we found that PRAL was downregulated in primary MM cells and cell lines, especially in MM cells with del(17p), and was associated with ISS (international staging system) stage and Durie-Salmon stage in MM patients. Survival curves showed that MM patients with low PRAL expression had a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) than the patients with high PRAL expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that PRAL expression was an independent predictor for DFS and OS. Then cell proliferation, viability, Ki67 expression, and caspase-3 activity detection showed that PRAL promoted MM cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, and potentiated the anti-MM effect of BTZ in vitro. We further identified and confirmed that miR-210 was the target of PRAL, and miR-210 overexpression overturned the potentiation effect of PRAL on BTZ efficacy. Subsequently, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) was confirmed to be the target of miR-210, and PRAL positively regulated the derepression of BMP2 by sponging miR-210. Overexpression of BMP2 potentiated the anti-MM effect of BTZ in vitro. In addition, animal experiments further confirmed that PRAL potentiated BTZ efficacy in vivo. Collectively, our study first revealed a critical role of PRAL-miR-210-BMP2 axis in MM progression, prognosis and treatment with BTZ, and PRAL could become a novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic candidate for MM patients especially for the MM patients harboring del(17p) in the future.

Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) serves as a reservoir for biologically active factors, such as growth factors and proteases that influence the tumor cell behavior. ADAMTS-1 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs) is a secreted protease that has the ability to modify the ECM during physiological and pathological processes. Here, we analyzed the role played by ADAMTS-1 regulating HGF and TGF-β1 activities in the high-grade fibrosarcoma cell line (HT1080). We generated HT1080 and HEK293T cells overexpressing ADAMTS-1. HT1080 cells overexpressing ADAMTS-1 (HT1080-MPA) exhibited a significant decrease in cell proliferation and migration velocity, both in presence of HGF. We obtained similar results with ADAMTS-1-enriched conditioned medium from other cell type. However, ADAMTS-1 overexpression failed to affect TGF-β1 activity associated with HT1080 cell proliferation and migration velocity. Immunoblotting showed that ADAMTS-1 overexpression disturbs c-Met activation upon HGF stimulation. Downstream ERK1/2 and FAK signaling pathways are also influenced by this protease. Additionally, ADAMTS-1 decreased the size of the fibrosarcospheres, both under normal conditions and in the presence of HGF. Likewise, in presence of HGF, ADAMTS-1 overexpression in HT1080 disrupted microtumors formation in vivo. These microtumors, including individual cells, presented characteristics of non-invasive lesions (rounded morphology). Our results suggest that ADAMTS-1 is involved in regulating HGF-related functions on fibrosarcoma cells. This protease may then represent an endogenous mechanism in controlling the bioavailability of different growth factors that have a direct influence on tumor cell behavior.

Abstract: Parkin-related mitophagy is vital for endothelial cell viability and the development of atherosclerosis, although the upstream regulatory factor underlying Parkin-mediated mitophagy in endothelial apoptosis and atherosclerosis progression remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) is actually expressed in aortic endothelial cells (AECs) under oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) treatment in vitro or isolated from high-fat treated mice in vivo. Higher NR4A1 levels were associated with AEC apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and energy disorder. At the molecular level, ox-LDL stimulation increased NR4A1 expression, which evoked Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Excessive mitophagy overtly consumed mitochondrial mass, leading to an energy shortage and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, loss of NR4A1 protected AECs against ox-LDL induced apoptosis by inhibiting excessive mitophagy. Furthermore, we also identified that NR4A1 regulated Parkin activation via post-transcriptional modification by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Activated CaMKII via NR4A1 induced the phosphorylated activation of Parkin. In summary, our data support the role of NR4A1/CaMKII/Parkin/mitophagy in AEC apoptosis and atherosclerosis formation and provide new insights into treating atherosclerosis with respect to endothelial viability, mitophagy, and NR4A1.

Abstract: Summary
Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies are readily detected in mice and people, but the mechanisms underlying the induction of serum IgA and its role in host protection remain uncertain. We report that select commensal bacteria induce several facets of systemic IgA-mediated immunity. Exposing conventional mice to a unique but natural microflora that included several members of the Proteobacteria phylum led to T cell-dependent increases in serum IgA levels and the induction of large numbers of IgA-secreting plasma cells in the bone marrow. The resulting serum IgA bound to a restricted collection of bacterial taxa, and antigen-specific serum IgA antibodies were readily induced after intestinal colonization with the commensal bacterium Helicobacter muridarum. Finally, movement to a Proteobacteria-rich microbiota led to serum IgA-mediated resistance to polymicrobial sepsis. We conclude that commensal microbes overtly influence the serum IgA repertoire, resulting in constitutive protection against bacterial sepsis.

Abstract: TGFβ contributes to mesangial cell hypertrophy and matrix protein increase in various kidney diseases including diabetic nephropathy. Deptor is an mTOR-interacting protein and suppresses mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities. We have recently shown that TGFβ-induced inhibition of deptor increases the mTOR activity. The mechanism by which TGFβ regulates deptor expression is not known. Here we identify deptor as a target of the microRNA-181a. We show that in mesangial cells, TGFβ increases the expression of miR-181a to downregulate deptor. Decrease in deptor augments mTORC2 activity, resulting in phosphorylation/activation of Akt kinase. Akt promotes inactivating phosphorylation of PRAS40 and tuberin, leading to stimulation of mTORC1. miR-181a-mimic increased mTORC1 and C2 activities, while anti-miR-181a inhibited them. mTORC1 controls protein synthesis via phosphorylation of translation initiation and elongation suppressors 4EBP-1 and eEF2 kinase. TGFβ-stimulated miR-181a increased the phosphorylation of 4EBP-1 and eEF2 kinase, resulting in their inactivation. miR-181a-dependent inactivation of eEF2 kinase caused dephosphorylation of eEF2. Consequently, miR-181a-mimic increased protein synthesis and hypertrophy of mesangial cells similar to TGFβ. Anti-miR-181a blocked these events in a deptor-dependent manner. Finally, TGFβ-miR-181a-driven deptor downregulation increased the expression of fibronectin. Our results identify a novel mechanism involving miR-181a-driven deptor downregulation, which contributes to mesangial cell pathologies in renal complications.

Abstract: Background
Plant natural products have many different biological activities but the precise mechanisms underlying these activities remain largely unknown. Hypericum longistylum has long been recorded in Chinese medicine as a cure for depression and related disorders, but how it repairs neural lineages has not been addressed.
Methods
We extracted compounds from Hypericum longistylum and determined their effect on neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro by using the Pax6-GFP reporter system. The amount of serotonin released during differentiation was measured by HPLC. The tail suspension test and forced swimming test was performed for determining the effect of compounds on depression-like behaviors in mice.
Results
We found that one of the phloroglucinol derivatives not only facilitated differentiation of neural progenitor cells, but also increased the efficiency of differentiation into serotonergic neurons. This compound also improved the behaviors of mice placed in a stressful environment and reduced signs of depression.
Conclusions
This is the first use of Chinese herb derived-natural products to promote neurogenesis of ESCs, including the generation of serotonergic neurons, and the first attempt to identify the active compound in Hypericum longistylum responsible for its beneficial effects on depressive diseases.

Abstract: The protective effects of chitosan (CS) supplementations on oxidative stress induced by diquat in weaned piglets were investigated. A total of 36 crossbreed piglets with an average live body weight (BW) of 8.80±0.53 kg were weaned at 28 ± 2 days and randomly divided into six dietary treatments (n = 6): control (basal diet), negative control (10 mg diquat/kg BW injected to piglets fed with basal diet), and basal diet treatments containing either 250, 500, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg of CS administered to piglets injected with 10 mg diquat/kg BW. The experiment conducted for 21 days which consisted of pre-starter period (14 days) and starter period (7 days). BW, feed intake, and fecal consistency were monitored. Blood samples were collected to determine antioxidative and immune parameters. CS supplementation improved the growth performance and decreased fecal score of piglets from days 1 to 14. Diquat also induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses by decreasing the activities of antioxidant and regulating cytokines. But dietary CS alleviated these negative effects induced by diquat that showed decreasing serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines but increasing activities of antioxidant enzymes and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Results indicated that CS attenuated the oxidative stress of piglets caused by diquat injection.

Abstract: Summary
Crop disease outbreaks are often associated with clonal expansions of single pathogenic lineages. To determine whether similar boom-and-bust scenarios hold for wild pathosystems, we carried out a multi-year, multi-site survey of Pseudomonas in its natural host Arabidopsis thaliana. The most common Pseudomonas lineage corresponded to a ubiquitous pathogenic clade. Sequencing of 1,524 genomes revealed this lineage to have diversified approximately 300,000 years ago, containing dozens of genetically identifiable pathogenic sublineages. There is differentiation at the level of both gene content and disease phenotype, although the differentiation may not provide fitness advantages to specific sublineages. The coexistence of sublineages indicates that in contrast to crop systems, no single strain has been able to overtake the studied A. thaliana populations in the recent past. Our results suggest that selective pressures acting on a plant pathogen in wild hosts are likely to be much more complex than those in agricultural systems.

Abstract: Summary
Cooperative action of a transcription factor complex containing OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and KLF4 maintains the naive pluripotent state; however, less is known about the mechanisms that disrupt this complex, initiating exit from pluripotency. We show that, as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) exit pluripotency, KLF4 protein is exported from the nucleus causing rapid decline in Nanog and Klf4 transcription; as a result, KLF4 is the first pluripotency transcription factor removed from transcription-associated complexes during differentiation. KLF4 nuclear export requires ERK activation, and phosphorylation of KLF4 by ERK initiates interaction of KLF4 with nuclear export factor XPO1, leading to KLF4 export. Mutation of the ERK phosphorylation site in KLF4 (S132) blocks KLF4 nuclear export, the decline in Nanog, Klf4, and Sox2 mRNA, and differentiation. These findings demonstrate that relocalization of KLF4 to the cytoplasm is a critical first step in exit from the naive pluripotent state and initiation of ESC differentiation.

Abstract: Silicosis is an incurable and progressive lung disease characterized by chronic inflammation and fibroblasts accumulation. Studies have indicated a vital role for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in fibroblasts accumulation. NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical mediator of inflammation in response to a wide range of stimuli (including silica particles), and plays an important role in many respiratory diseases. However, whether NLRP3 inflammasome regulates silica-induced EMT remains unknown. Our results showed that silica induced EMT in human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE cells) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, silica persistently activated NLRP3 inflammasome as indicated by continuously elevated extracellular levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition by short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of NLRP3, selective inhibitor MCC950, and caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK attenuated silica-induced EMT. Western blot analysis indicated that TAK1-MAPK-Snail/NF-κB pathway involved NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated EMT. Moreover, pirfenidone, a commercially and clinically available drug approved for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), effectively suppressed silica-induced EMT of 16HBE cells in line with NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. Collectively, our results indicate that NLRP3 inflammasome is a promising target for blocking or retarding EMT-mediated fibrosis in pulmonary silicosis. On basis of this mechanism, pirfenidone might be a potential drug for the treatment of silicosis.

Abstract: Summary
For kinase inhibitors, intracellular target selectivity is fundamental to pharmacological mechanism. Although a number of acellular techniques have been developed to measure kinase binding or enzymatic inhibition, such approaches can fail to accurately predict engagement in cells. Here we report the application of an energy transfer technique that enabled the first broad-spectrum, equilibrium-based approach to quantitatively profile target occupancy and compound affinity in live cells. Using this method, we performed a selectivity profiling for clinically relevant kinase inhibitors against 178 full-length kinases, and a mechanistic interrogation of the potency offsets observed between cellular and biochemical analysis. For the multikinase inhibitor crizotinib, our approach accurately predicted cellular potency and revealed improved target selectivity compared with biochemical measurements. Due to cellular ATP, a number of putative crizotinib targets are unexpectedly disengaged in live cells at a clinically relevant drug dose.

Abstract: Oxidative stress-mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia is critical in the development of neurodegerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD). However, the mechanism underlying oxidative stress activates NLRP3 inflammasome remains exclusive. Here we demonstrated cathepsin B (CTSB) as a regulator of the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by H2O2·H2O2 induced IL-1β secretion in NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner·H2O2 treatment increased CTSB activity, which in turn activated NLRP3 inflammasome, and subsequently processed pro-caspase-1 cleavage into caspase-1, resulting in IL-1 β secretion. Genetic inhibition or pharmacological inhibition of CTSB blocked the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into caspase-1 and subsequent IL-1 β secretion induced by H2O2. Importantly, CTSB activity, IL-1β levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) were remarkably elevated in plasma of AD patients compared to healthy controls, while glutathione was significantly lower than healthy controls. Correlation analyses showed that CTSB activity was positively correlated with IL-1β and MDA levels, but negatively correlated with GSH levels in plasma of AD patients. Taken together, our results indicate that oxidative stress activates NLRP3 through upregulating CTSB activity. Our results identify an important biological function of CTSB in neuroinflammation, suggesting that CTSB is a potential target in AD therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Gut-associated bacteria produce metabolites that both have a local influence on the intestinal tract and act at a distance on remote organs. In Drosophila, bacteria-derived peptidoglycan (PGN) displays such a dual role. PGN triggers local antimicrobial peptide production by enterocytes; it also activates systemic immune responses in fat-body cells and modulates fly behavior by acting on neurons. How these responses to a single microbiota-derived compound are simultaneously coordinated is not understood. We show here that the PGRP-LB locus generates both cytosolic and secreted PGN-cleaving enzymes. Through genetic analysis, we demonstrate that the cytosolic PGRP-LB isoforms cell-autonomously control the intensity of NF-κB activation in enterocytes, whereas the secreted isoform prevents massive and detrimental gut-derived PGN dissemination throughout the organism. This study explains how Drosophila are able to uncouple the modulation of local versus systemic responses to a single gut-bacteria-derived product by using isoform-specific enzymes.

Abstract: This study demonstrates highly dynamic spatial and temporal pattern of SULF1/SULF2 expression in a number of neuronal cell types growing in normal culture medium that included their transient nuclear mobilisation. Their nuclear translocation became particularly apparent during cell proliferation as both SULF1/SULF2 demonstrated not only cell membrane associated expression, their known site of function but also transient nuclear mobilisation during nuclear cell division. Nuclear localisation was apparent not only by immunocytochemical staining but also confirmed by immunoblotting staining of isolated nuclear fractions of C6, U87 and N2A cells. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated rapid nuclear exit of both SULF1/SULF2 following cell division that was slightly delayed but not blocked in a fraction of the polyploid cells observed in C6 cells. The overexpression of both Sulf1 and Sulf2 genes in C6 and U87 cells markedly promoted in vitro growth of these cells accompanied by nuclear mobilisation while inhibition of both these genes inhibited cell proliferation with little or no nuclear SULF1/SULF2 mobilisation. SULF1/SULF2 activity in these cells thus demonstrated a clear co-ordination of extracellular cell signalling with nuclear events related to cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii triggers severe small intestinal immunopathology characterized by IFN-γ- and intestinal microbiota-mediated inflammation, Paneth cell loss, and bacterial dysbiosis. Paneth cells are a prominent secretory epithelial cell type that resides at the base of intestinal crypts and releases antimicrobial peptides. We demonstrate that the microbiota triggers basal Paneth cell-specific autophagy via induction of IFN-γ, a known trigger of autophagy, to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Deletion of the autophagy protein Atg5 specifically in Paneth cells results in exaggerated intestinal inflammation characterized by complete destruction of the intestinal crypts resembling that seen in pan-epithelial Atg5-deficient mice. Additionally, lack of functional autophagy in Paneth cells within intestinal organoids and T. gondii-infected mice causes increased sensitivity to the proinflammatory cytokine TNF along with increased intestinal permeability, leading to exaggerated microbiota- and IFN-γ-dependent intestinal immunopathology. Thus, Atg5 expression in Paneth cells is essential for tissue protection against cytokine-mediated immunopathology during acute gastrointestinal infection.

Abstract: Summary
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), one of the most frequent inherited peripheral neuropathies, is associated with PMP22 gene duplication. Previous studies of CMT1A mainly relied on rodent models, and it is not yet clear how PMP22 overexpression leads to the phenotype in patients. Here, we generated the human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines from two CMT1A patients as an in vitro cell model. We found that, unlike the normal control cells, CMT1A hiPSCs rarely generated Schwann cells through neural crest stem cells (NCSCs). Instead, CMT1A NCSCs produced numerous endoneurial fibroblast-like cells in the Schwann cell differentiation system, and similar results were obtained in a PMP22-overexpressing iPSC model. Therefore, despite the demyelination-remyelination and/or dysmyelination theory for CMT1A pathogenesis, developmental disabilities of Schwann cells may be considered as an underlying cause of CMT1A. Our results may have important implications for the uncovering of the underlying mechanism and the development of a promising therapeutic strategy for CMT1A neuropathy.

Abstract: Summary
Malaria is a serious threat to human health and additional classes of antimalarial drugs are greatly needed. The human defense protein, platelet factor 4 (PF4), has intrinsic antiplasmodial activity but also undesirable chemokine properties. We engineered a peptide containing the isolated PF4 antiplasmodial domain, which through cyclization, retained the critical structure of the parent protein. The peptide, cPF4PD, killed cultured blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum with low micromolar potency by specific disruption of the parasite digestive vacuole. Its mechanism of action involved selective penetration and accumulation inside the intraerythrocytic parasite without damaging the host cell or parasite membranes; it did not accumulate in uninfected cells. This selective activity was accounted for by observations of the peptide's specific binding and penetration of membranes with exposed negatively charged phospholipid headgroups. Our findings highlight the tremendous potential of the cPF4PD scaffold for developing antimalarial peptide drugs with a distinct and selective mechanism of action.

Abstract: Fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2), the enzyme catalyzing α-1,2-fucosylation in mammals, has been implicated in cancer. The up-regulation of FUT2 has been observed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and FUT2 can enhance the cell migration and invasion of LUAD cell lines. However, the underlying mechanism of FUT2 in LUAD remains largely unknown. Abundant studies have revealed that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) played a pivotal role during lung cancer metastasis and progression. In the present study, we showed that knocking down FUT2 in LUAD cell lines increased the expression of E-cadherin and reduced the expression of Vimentin, N-cadherin, TβRII, p-Smad2, p-Smad3 and Snail, which were the makers of EMT. Meanwhile, the expression of E-cadherin was decreased, and the expression of Vimentin was increased by restoring the expression of FUT2 in RNA interference FUT2 (RNAi-FUT2) cells, suggesting that FUT2 enhanced the EMT process in LUAD. Additionally, silencing FUT2 expression can up-regulate E-cadherin and down-regulate Vimentin, significantly attenuated EMT in vivo. Treated with the SIS3, a new-type inhibitor of p-Smad3 of TGF-β signaling, the expression of E-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail were not affected by RNAi-FUT2 cells, indicating that the effect of FUT2 on EMT depended on TGF-β/Smad signaling. Overall, the current results indicated that FUT2 might promote LUAD metastasis through the EMT initiated by TGF-β/Smad signaling. Therefore, FUT2 might be a prognostic factor and therapeutic target for LUAD.

Abstract: Heat stress is exacerbated by global warming and affects human and animal health, leading to heart damage caused by imbalances in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant system, acid-base chemistry, electrolytes and respiratory alkalosis. Vitamin C scavenges excess ROS, and sodium bicarbonate maintains acid-base and electrolyte balance, and alleviates respiratory alkalosis. Herein, we explored the ability of vitamin C alone and in combination with equimolar sodium bicarbonate (Vitamin C-Na) to stimulate endogenous antioxidants and heat shock proteins (HSPs) to relieve heat stress in H9C2 cells. Control, vitamin C (20 μg/ml vitamin C for 16 h) and vitamin C-Na (20 μg/ml vitamin C-Na for 16 h) groups were heat-stressed for 1, 3 or 5 h. Granular and vacuolar degeneration, karyopyknosis and damage to nuclei and mitochondria were clearly reduced in treatment groups, as were apoptosis, lactate dehydrogenase activity and ROS and malondialdehyde levels, while superoxide dismutase activity was increased. Additionally, CRYAB, Hsp27, Hsp60 and Hsp70 mRNA levels were upregulated at 3 h (p < 0.01), and protein levels were increased for CRYAB at 0 h (p < 0.05) and 1 h (p < 0.01), and for Hsp70 at 3 and 5 h (p < 0.01). Thus, pre-treatment with vitamin C or vitamin C-Na might protect H9C2 cells against heat damage by enhancing the antioxidant ability and upregulating CRYAB and Hsp70.

Abstract: The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp31p protein belongs to the ubiquitous DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI family. The most prominent member of this family is human DJ-1; defects of this protein are associated with Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis. Numerous recent findings reported by our group and others have revealed the importance of Hsp31p for survival in the post-diauxic phase of cell growth and under diverse environmental stresses. Hsp31p was shown to possess glutathione-independent glyoxalase III activity and to function as a protein chaperone, suggesting that it has multiple cellular roles. Our previous work also revealed that HSP31 gene expression was controlled by multiple stress-related transcription factors, which mediated HSP31 promoter responses to oxidative, osmotic, and thermal stresses, toxic products of glycolysis, and the diauxic shift. Nevertheless, the exact role of Hsp31p within budding yeast cells remains elusive. Here, we aimed to obtain insights into the function of Hsp31p based on its intracellular localization. We have demonstrated that the Hsp31p-GFP fusion protein is localized to the cytosol under most environmental conditions and that it becomes particulate in response to oxidative stress. However, the particles do not colocalize with other granular subcellular structures present in budding yeast cells. The observed particulate localization does not seem to be important for Hsp31p functionality. Instead, it is likely the result of oxidative damage, as the particle abundance increases when Hsp31p is nonfunctional, when the cellular oxidative stress response is affected, or when cellular maintenance systems that optimize the state of the proteome are compromised.

Abstract: Collagen prolyl hydroxylases (P3H) are required for proper collagen biosynthesis. One of the family members P3H3 was downregulated in breast cancer and lymphoma due to DNA methylation. However the role of P3H3 in lung cancer has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we analyzed P3H3 expression in a panel of lung cancer cell lines and primary lung tumors. Epigenetic regulation was explored and the function of P3H3 was investigated by stable transfection and RNA interference. We found that P3H3 was downregulated in 6 out of 10 lung cancer cell lines. A heterogeneous methylation pattern of P3H3 was found in the exon region. In primary lung tumors, immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray (TMA) showed that higher expression of P3H3 was significantly associated with lower tumor N stage and grade (p = 0.035 and p = 0.026, respectively). Ectopic expression of P3H3 inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration as well as invasion, and induced apoptosis together with cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Knockdown of P3H3 led to increased migratory and invasive potential. These Phenomena are accompanied by enhanced p21, decreased cyclin A1 levels and increased caspase 3/7 activities. Taken together, we feel that P3H3 is a novel tumor suppressor and its protein expression is inversely related to lymph node metastasis and tumor differentiation in lung cancer.

Abstract: Arhgap21 is a member of the Rho GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP) family, which function as negative regulators of Rho GTPases. Arhgap21 has been implicated in adhesion and migration of cancer cells. However, the role of Arhgap21 has never been investigated in hematopoietic cells. Herein, we evaluated functional aspects of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) using a haploinsufficient (Arhgap21+/−) mouse. Our results show that Arhgap21+/− mice have an increased frequency of phenotypic HSC, impaired ability to form progenitor colonies in vitro and decreased hematopoietic engraftment in vivo, along with a decrease in LSK cell frequency during serial bone marrow transplantation. Arhgap21+/− hematopoietic progenitor cells have impaired adhesion and enhanced mobilization of immature LSK and myeloid progenitors. Arhgap21+/− mice also exhibit reduced erythroid commitment and differentiation, which was recapitulated in human primary cells, in which knockdown of ARHGAP21 in CMP and MEP resulted in decreased erythroid commitment. Finally, we observed enhanced RhoC activity in the bone marrow cells of Arhgap21+/− mice, indicating that Arhgap21 functions in hematopoiesis may be at least partially mediated by RhoC inactivation.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal epithelium in the Drosophila midgut is maintained by intestinal stem cells (ISCs), which are capable of generating both enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells (EEs) via alternative cell fate specification. Activation of Delta-Notch signaling directs ISCs for enterocyte generation, but how EEs are generated from ISCs remains poorly understood. Here, we identified Phyllopod (Phyl) as a key regulator that drives EE generation from ISCs. Phyl, which is normally suppressed by Notch, functions as an adaptor protein that bridges Tramtrack 69 (Ttk69) and E3 ubiquitin ligase Sina for degradation. Degradation of Ttk69 allows the activation of the Achaete-Scute Complex (AS-C)-Pros regulatory axis, which promotes EE specification. Interestingly, expression of AS-C genes in turn further induces Phyl expression, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop for continuous EE fate specification and commitment. This positive feedback circuit-driven regulatory mechanism could represent a common strategy for reliable and irreversible cell fate determination from progenitor cells.

Abstract: Cell extensions are critical structures that enable matrix remodeling in wound healing and cancer invasion but the regulation of their formation is not well-defined. We searched for new proteins that mediated cell extension formation over collagen by tandem mass tagged mass spectrometry analysis of purified extensions in 3T3 fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, importin-5, ENH isoform 1b (PDLIM5) and 26 S protease regulatory subunit 6B (PSMC4) were more abundant (> 10-fold) in membrane-penetrating cell extensions than cell bodies, which was confirmed by immunostaining and immunoblotting and also observed in human gingival fibroblasts. After siRNA knockdown of these proteins and plating cells on grid-supported floating collagen gels for 6 h, formation of cell extensions and collagen remodeling were examined. Knockdown of importin-5 reduced collagen compaction (1.9-fold), pericellular collagen degradation (~ 1.8-fold) and number of cell extensions (~ 69%). Knockdown of PSMC4 reduced collagen compaction (~ 1.5-fold), pericellular collagen degradation (~ 1.7-fold) and number of cell extensions (~ 42%). Knockdown of PDLIM5 reduced collagen compaction (~ 1.6-fold) and number of cell extensions (~ 21%). Inhibition of the TGF-β RI kinase, Smad3 or ROCK-II signaling pathways reduced the abundance of PDLIM5 in cell extensions but PSMC4 and importin-5 were reduced only by Smad3 or ROCK-II inhibitors. We conclude that these novel proteins are required for cell extension formation and their recruitment into extensions involves the Smad3 and ROCK signaling pathways.

Abstract: Long-term neural differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is associated with enhanced neuronal maturation, which is a necessity for creation of representative in vitro models. It also induces neurogenic-to-gliogenic fate switch, increasing proportion of endogenous astrocytes formed from the common neural progenitors. However, the significance of prolonged differentiation on the neural cell type composition and functional development of hPSC-derived neuronal cells has not been well characterized. Here, we studied two hPSC lines, both of which initially showed good neuronal differentiation capacity. However, the propensity for endogenous astrogenesis and maturation state after extended differentiation varied. Live cell calcium imaging revealed that prolonged differentiation facilitated maturation of GABAergic signaling. According to extracellular recordings with microelectrode array (MEA), neuronal activity was limited to fewer areas of the culture, which expressed more frequent burst activity. Efficient maturation after prolonged differentiation also promoted organization of spontaneous activity by burst compaction. These results suggest that although prolonged neural differentiation can be challenging, it has beneficial effect on functional maturation, which can also improve transition to different neural in vitro models and applications.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we show that HEMATOLOGICAL AND NEUROLOGICAL EXPRESSED 1-LIKE (HN1L) is a targetable breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) gene that is altered in 25% of whole breast cancer and significantly correlated with shorter overall or relapse-free survival in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. HN1L silencing reduced the population of BCSCs, inhibited tumor initiation, resensitized chemoresistant tumors to docetaxel, and hindered cancer progression in multiple TNBC cell line-derived xenografts. Additionally, gene signatures associated with HN1L correlated with shorter disease-free survival of TNBC patients. We defined HN1L as a BCSC transcription regulator for genes involved in the LEPR-STAT3 signaling axis as HN1L binds to a putative consensus upstream sequence of STAT3, LEPTIN RECEPTOR, and MIR-150. Our data reveal that BCSCs in TNBC depend on the transcription regulator HN1L for the sustained activation of the LEPR-STAT3 pathway, which makes it a potentially important target for both prognosis and BCSC therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Human breast cancer cells are known to activate adjacent “normal-like” cells to enhance their own growth, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We now show by both phenotypic and functional measurements that normal human mammary progenitor cells are significantly under-represented in the mammary epithelium of patients' tumor-adjacent tissue (TAT). Interestingly, fibroblasts isolated from TAT samples showed a reduced ability to support normal EGF-stimulated mammary progenitor cell proliferation in vitro via their increased secretion of transforming growth factor β. In contrast, TAT fibroblasts promoted the proliferation of human breast cancer cells when these were co-transplanted in immunodeficient mice. The discovery of a common stromal cell-mediated mechanism that has opposing growth-suppressive and promoting effects on normal and malignant human breast cells and also extends well beyond currently examined surgical margins has important implications for disease recurrence and its prevention.

Chitosan oligosaccharides enhance lipid droplets via down-regulation of PCSK9 gene expression in HepG2 cells,

Abstract: Chitosan oligosaccharides (COS), linear polymers of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and deacetylated glucosamine, exhibit diverse pharmacological effects such as antimicrobial, antitumor, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we explored their hypocholesterolemic effects in vivo and the molecular mechanisms of COS in hepatic cells. Our in vivo study of dyslipidemic ApoE-/- male mice showed that COS treatment of 500 mg kg−1 d−1 for 4 weeks clearly reduced the lipid deposits in the aorta and significantly decreased the hepatic proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) protein levels versus HFD groups (p < 0.05). To elucidate the mechanisms behind these effects, the HepG2 cell line was treated with COS. We found that COS (200 μg/ml) increased the amount of cell-surface low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and enhanced the lipid droplets in HepG2 cells (p < 0.05). The mRNA levels of LDLR and HMG-CoA protein levels were not altered, and the mRNA levels of PCSK9 were down-regulated by COS treatment for 24 h. We also observed that the expression levels of SREBP-2 (125 kD) and HNF-1α were increased in total cell lysates, but nuclear SREBP-2 (nSREBP-2, 68 kD, the active subunit of SREBP-2) levels were decreased and FOXO3a levels increased in nuclear lysates after COS treatment for 24 h. We demonstrated that one of the reasons for regulation of lipid transfer with COS is that FOXO3a levels are up-regulated by COS, leading to a reduction in the PCSK9 promoter binding capacity of HNF-1α and thus suppressing PCSK9 gene expression, up-regulating LDLR levels, and enhancing the lipid droplets in HepG2 cells. In addition, decreased expression of the PCSK9 gene was also contributed to by down-regulation of SREBP-2 by COS. We further confirmed the effect of suppression of PCSK9 expression by COS by utilizing RNA interference to silence HNF-1α and SREBP-2. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that PCSK9 expression and LDLR activity are synergistically changed by a combination of HNF-1α and SREBP-2 after COS treatment. Our findings indicate that COS may regulate PCSK9 to modulate hepatic LDLR abundance and activity.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogenesis requires retinoic acid (RA) induction of the undifferentiated to differentiating transition in transit amplifying (TA) progenitor spermatogonia, whereas continuity of the spermatogenic lineage relies on the RA response being suppressed in spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Here, we discovered that, in mouse testes, both spermatogonial populations possess intrinsic RA-response machinery and exhibit hallmarks of the differentiating transition following direct exposure to RA, including loss of SSC regenerative capacity. We determined that SSCs are only resistant to RA-driven differentiation when situated in the normal topological organization of the testis. Furthermore, we show that the soma is instrumental in “priming” TA progenitors for RA-induced differentiation through elevated RA receptor expression. Collectively, these findings indicate that SSCs and TA progenitor spermatogonia inhabit disparate niche microenvironments within seminiferous tubules that are critical for mediating extrinsic cues that drive fate decisions.

Abstract: Summary
Protein phosphorylation regulates diverse processes in eukaryotic cells. Strategies for installing site-specific phosphorylation in target proteins in eukaryotic cells, through routes that are orthogonal to enzymatic post-translational modification, would provide a powerful route for defining the consequences of particular phosphorylations. Here we show that the SepRSv1.0/tRNAv1.0CUA pair (created from the Methanococcus maripaludis phosphoseryl-transfer RNA synthetase [MmSepRS]/Methanococcus janaschii [Mj]tRNAGCACys pair) is orthogonal in mammalian cells. We create a eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1α) variant, EF-1α-Sep, that enhances phosphoserine incorporation, and combine this with a mutant of eRF1, and manipulations of the cell’s phosphoserine biosynthetic pathway, to enable the genetically encoded incorporation of phosphoserine and its non-hydrolyzable phosphonate analog. Using this approach we demonstrate synthetic activation of a protein kinase in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Never in mitosis A-related kinase 2A (Nek2A), a centrosomal serine/threonine kinase, is involved in mitotic progression by regulating the centrosome cycle. Particularly, Nek2A is necessary for dissolution of the intercentriole linkage between the duplicated centrosomes prior to mitosis. Nek2A activity roughly parallels its cell cycle-dependent expression levels, but the precise mechanism regulating its activity remains unclear. In this study, we found that γ-taxilin co-localized with Nek2A at the centrosome during interphase and interacted with Nek2A in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays and that γ-taxilin regulated centrosome disjunction in a Nek2A-dependent manner. γ-Taxilin depletion increased the number of cells with striking splitting of centrosomes. The precocious splitting of centrosomes induced by γ-taxilin depletion was attenuated by Nek2A depletion, suggesting that γ-taxilin depletion induces the Nek2A-mediated dissolution of the intercentriole linkage between the duplicated centrosomes nevertheless mitosis does not yet begin. Taken together with the result that γ-taxilin protein expression levels were decreased at the onset of mitosis, we propose that γ-taxilin participates in Nek2A-mediated centrosome disjunction as a negative regulator through its interaction with Nek2A.

Abstract: In this study, we studied the effect of 2.0 GHz radio frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) and 50 Hz extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) exposure on prion generation and propagation using two budding yeast strains, NT64C and SB34, as model organisms. Under exposure to RF-EMF or ELF-EMF, the de novo generation and propagation of yeast prions [URE3] were elevated in both strains. The elevation increased over time, and the effects of ELF-EMF occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The transcription and expression levels of the molecular chaperones Hsp104, Hsp70-Ssa1/2, and Hsp40-Ydj1 were not statistically significantly changed after exposure. Furthermore, the levels of ROS, as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), were significantly elevated after short-term, but not long-term exposure. This work demonstrated for the first time that EMF exposure could elevate the de novo generation and propagation of yeast prions and supports the hypothesis that ROS may play a role in the effects of EMF on protein misfolding. The effects of EMF on protein folding and ROS levels may mediate the broad effects of EMF on cell function.

Abstract: Arterial calcification is a common feature of cardiovascular disease. Sortilin is involved in the development of atherosclerosis, but the specific mechanism is unclear. In this study, we established calcification models in vivo and in vitro by using vitamin D3 and β-glycerophosphate, respectively. In vivo, the expression of SORT1 was up-regulated and the expression of miR-182 was down-regulated in calcified arterial tissues. Meanwhile there was a negative correlation between SORT1 expression and miR-182 levels. In vitro, downregulating SORT1 expression using shRNA inhibited β-glycerophosphoric induced vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) calcification. Moreover, reduced sortilin levels followed transfection of miR-182 mimics, whereas there was a significant increase in sortilin levels after transfection of miR-182 inhibitors. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed that SORT1 is the direct target of miR-182. Our study suggests that SORT1 plays a vital role in the development of arterial calcification and is regulated by miR-182.

Abstract: Summary
Nosiheptide, an archetypal member of thiopeptide antibiotics, arises from post-translational modifications of a ribosomally synthesized precursor peptide that contains an N-terminal leader peptide (LP) sequence and a C-terminal core peptide (CP) sequence. Despite extensive efforts concerning the biosynthesis of thiopeptide antibiotics, the regulatory mechanisms in this process remain poorly understood. Using the nosiheptide-producing Streptomyces actuosus strain as a model system, we report here that NosP, a Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein, serves as the only cluster-situated regulator and activates the transcription of all structural genes, which are organized into two divergently transcribed operons in the nos cluster, by binding to their intergenic region. NocP, the counterpart of NosP in Nocardia sp., regulates the production of structurally related nocathiacin I in a similar manner. NosP activity senses the nosiheptide biosynthetic process by interactions with both peptidyl and small-molecule ligands that result from the LP and CP parts of the precursor peptide, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
The bone marrow niche plays a critical role in controlling the fate of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by integrating intrinsic and extrinsic signals. However, the molecular events in the HSC niche remain to be investigated. Here, we report that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) maintains HSC quiescence and repopulation capacity in the niche. ICAM-1-deficient mice (ICAM-1−/−) displayed significant expansion of phenotypic long-term HSCs with impaired quiescence, as well as favoring myeloid cell expansion. ICAM-1-deficient HSCs presented normal reconstitution capacity during serial transplantation; however, reciprocal transplantation experiments showed that ICAM-1 deficiency in the niche impaired HSC quiescence and repopulation capacity. In addition, ICAM-1 deletion caused failure to retain HSCs in the bone marrow and changed the expression profile of stroma cell-derived factors, possibly representing the mechanism for defective HSCs in ICAM-1−/− mice. Collectively, these observations identify ICAM-1 as a regulator in the bone marrow niche.

Abstract: Neural progenitor cell (NPC) fate is influenced by a variety of biological cues elicited from the surrounding microenvironment and recent studies suggest their possible role in pediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Since a few GBM cells also display NPC characteristics, it is not clear whether NPCs transform to tumor cell phenotype leading to the onset of GBM formation, or NPCs migrate to developing tumor sites in response to paracrine signaling from GBM cells. Elucidating the paracrine interactions between GBM cells and NPCs in vivo is challenging due to the inherent complexity of the CNS. Here, we investigated the interactions between human NPCs (ReNcell) and human pediatric GBM-derived cells (SJ-GBM2) using a Transwell® coculture setup to assess the effects of GBM cells on ReNcells (cytokine and chemokine release, viability, phenotype, differentiation, migration). Standalone ReNcell or GBM cultures served as controls. Qualitative and quantitative results from ELISA®, Live/Dead® and BrdU assays, immunofluorescence labeling, western blot analysis, and scratch test suggests that although ReNcell viability remained unaffected in the presence of pediatric GBM cells, their morphology, phenotype, differentiation patterns, neurite outgrowth, migration patterns (average speed, distance, number of cells) and GSK-3β expression were significantly influenced. The cumulative distance migrated by the cells in each condition was fit to Furth's formula, derived formally from Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. ReNcell differentiation into neural lineage was compromised and astrogenesis promoted within cocultures. Such coculture platform could be extended to identify the specific molecules contributing to the observed phenomena, to investigate whether NPCs could be transplanted to replace lesions of excised tumor sites, and to elucidate the underlying molecular pathways involved in GBM-NPC interactions within the tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) have the innate capacity to sense pathogens and orchestrate immune responses. However, DCs do not mount efficient immune responses to HIV-1, primarily due to restriction of virus reverse transcription, which prevents accumulation of viral cDNA and limits its detection through the cGAS-STING pathway. By allowing reverse transcription to proceed, we find that DCs detect HIV-1 in distinct phases, before and after virus integration. Blocking integration suppresses, but does not abolish, activation of the transcription factor IRF3, downstream interferon (IFN) responses, and DC maturation. Consistent with two stages of detection, HIV-1 “primes” chromatin accessibility of innate immune genes before and after integration. Once primed, robust IFN responses can be unmasked by agonists of the innate adaptor protein, MyD88, through a process that requires cGAS, STING, IRF3, and nuclear factor κB. Thus, HIV-1 replication increases material available for sensing, and discrete inflammatory inputs tune cGAS signaling to drive DC maturation.

Abstract: Adult skeletal muscles are comprised of multinuclear muscle cells called myofibers. During skeletal muscle development and regeneration, mononuclear progenitor cells (myoblasts) fuse to form multinuclear myotubes, which mature and become myofibers. The molecular events mediating myoblast fusion are not fully understood. Here we report that Shisa2, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, regulates the fusion of muscle satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts. Shisa2 expression is repressed by Notch signaling, elevated in activated compared to quiescent satellite cells, and further upregulated during myogenic differentiation. Knockdown of Shisa2 inhibits the fusion of myoblasts without affecting proliferation. Conversely, Shisa2 overexpression in proliferating myoblasts inhibits their proliferation but promotes premature fusion. Interestingly, Shisa2-overexpressing nascent myotubes actively recruit myoblasts to fuse with. At the molecular level, Rac1/Cdc42-mediated cytoskeletal F-actin remodeling is required for Shisa2 to promote myoblast fusion. These results provide a novel mechanism through which an ER protein regulates myogenesis.

Abstract: Background
Metastatic and/or recurrent breast carcinomas are leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) have been implicated in cancer metastases and progression, thus, the need for the discovery and development of effective BCSCs-specific therapies against metastatic and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The expression of SCUBE2, originally identified in vascular endothelia, then in several non-endothelial cell types, is downregulated in invasive breast carcinomas. However, the role of SCUBE2 in BCSCs remains unknown. This present study investigated the probable involvements of SCUBE2 in BCSCs and TNBC metastasis.
Methods
The mRNA expression of SCUBE2, stemness and EMT markers in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T tumorspheres or adherent cells were evaluated by qRT-PCR and microarray analyses. Using gene overexpression, in vitro migration and invasion assays, as well as in vivo bioluminescence imaging, we evaluated the role of SCUBE2 in MDA-MB-231 or Hs578T BCSCs. Western blot and cytotoxicity assays helped identify and validate SCUBE2 molecular target(s) and inhibitor(s).
Results
Concurrently increased SCUBE2 expression and cell motility were observed in TNBC tumorspheres compared to the parental adherent cells. SCUBE2 overexpression augmented BCSCs motility in vitro, and enhanced TNBC metastasis in vivo. While SCUBE2 overexpression activated Notch signaling its downregulation suppressed Notch signal effectors NICD, Jagged 1, HEY1, and HES1.
Conclusions
We demonstrate that SCUBE2 expression is upregulated in BCSCs, promote EMT and enhance TNBC metastasis by activating Notch signaling. This reveals a potential druggable molecular target and an effective therapeutic strategy against metastatic and aggressive TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
Pepsin-family aspartic peptidases are biosynthesized as inactive zymogens in which the propeptide blocks the active site until its proteolytic removal upon enzyme activation. Here, we describe a novel dual regulatory function for the propeptide using a set of crystal structures of the parasite cathepsin D IrCD1. In the IrCD1 zymogen, intramolecular autoinhibition by the intact propeptide is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved exosite on the enzyme core. After activation, the mature enzyme employs the same exosite to rebind a small fragment derived from the cleaved propeptide. This fragment functions as an effective natural inhibitor of mature IrCD1 that operates in a pH-dependent manner through a unique allosteric inhibition mechanism. The study uncovers the propeptide-binding exosite as a target for the regulation of pepsin-family aspartic peptidases and defines the structural requirements for exosite inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
ATOH1 is a master transcription factor for the secretory lineage differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, the comprehensive contribution of ATOH1+ secretory lineage IECs to the homeostasis, repair, and tumorigenesis of the intestinal epithelium remains uncertain. Through our ATOH1+ cell-lineage tracing, we show here that a definite number of ATOH1+ IECs retain stem cell properties and can form ATOH1+IEC-derived clonal ribbons (ATOH1+ICRs) under completely homeostatic conditions. Interestingly, colonic ATOH1+ IECs appeared to exhibit their stem cell function more frequently compared with those of the small intestine. Consistently, the formation of ATOH1+ICRs was significantly enhanced upon dextran sodium sulfate colitis-induced mucosal damage. In addition, colonic ATOH1+ IECs acquired tumor stem cell-like properties in the azoxymethane-DSS tumor model. Our results reveal an unexpected contribution of colonic ATOH1+ IECs to maintaining the stem cell population under both homeostatic and pathologic conditions and further illustrate the high plasticity of the crypt-intrinsic stem cell hierarchy.

Abstract: Summary
Animal-microbe facultative symbioses play a fundamental role in ecosystem and organismal health. Yet, due to the flexible nature of their association, the selection pressures that act on animals and their facultative symbionts remain elusive. Here we apply experimental evolution to Drosophila melanogaster associated with its growth-promoting symbiont Lactobacillus plantarum, representing a well-established model of facultative symbiosis. We find that the diet of the host, rather than the host itself, is a predominant driving force in the evolution of this symbiosis. Furthermore, we identify a mechanism resulting from the bacterium's adaptation to the diet, which confers growth benefits to the colonized host. Our study reveals that bacterial adaptation to the host's diet may be the foremost step in determining the evolutionary course of a facultative animal-microbe symbiosis.

Abstract: Inflammatory cells such as macrophages can play a pro-tumorigenic role in the tumor stroma. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) generally display an M2 phenotype with tumor-promoting activity; however, the mechanisms regulating the TAM phenotype remain unclear. Complement 5a (C5a) is a cytokine-like polypeptide that is generated during complement system activation and is known to promote tumor growth. Herein, we investigated the role of C5a on macrophage polarization in colon cancer metastasis in mice. We found that deficiency of the C5a receptor (C5aR) severely impairs the metastatic ability of implanted colon cancer cells. C5aR was expressed on TAMs, which exhibited an M2-like functional profile in colon cancer liver metastatic lesions. Furthermore, C5a mediated macrophage polarization and this process relied substantially on activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Finally, analysis of human colon carcinoma indicated that C5aR expression is negatively associated with tumor differentiation grade. Our results demonstrate that C5aR has a central role in regulating the M2 phenotype of TAMs, which in turn, contributes to hepatic metastasis of colon cancer through NF-κB signaling. C5a is a potential novel marker for cancer prognosis and drugs targeting complement system activation, specifically the C5aR pathway, may offer new therapeutic opportunities for colon cancer management.

Abstract: The aorta-gonad-mesonephros region, from which definitive hematopoiesis first arises in midgestation mouse embryos, has intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters (IAHCs) containing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). We previously reported expression of the transcription factor Sox17 in IAHCs, and overexpression of Sox17 in CD45lowc-KIThigh cells comprising IAHCs maintains the formation of cell clusters and their multipotency in vitro over multiple passages. Here, we demonstrate the importance of NOTCH1 in IAHC formation and maintenance of the HSC/HPC phenotype. We further show that Notch1 expression is positively regulated by SOX17 via direct binding to its gene promoter. SOX17 and NOTCH1 were both found to be expressed in vivo in cells of IAHCs by whole mount immunostaining. We found that cells transduced with the active form of NOTCH1 or its downstream target, Hes1, maintained their multipotent colony-forming capacity in semisolid medium. Moreover, cells stimulated by NOTCH1 ligand, Jagged1, or Delta-like protein 1, had the capacity to form multilineage colonies. Conversely, knockdown of Notch1 and Hes1 led to a reduction of their multipotent colony-forming capacity. These results suggest that the Sox17-Notch1-Hes1 pathway is critical for maintaining the undifferentiated state of IAHCs.

Abstract: Fish oil has been widely recognized as an excellent dietary source of polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA. However, it can undergo oxidation easily resulting in the formation of toxic off flavor compounds such as hydroperoxides. These compounds adversely affect the nutritional quality and may induce several stress reactions in body. To solve this problem, a new antioxidant bio-material, vanillic acid-grafted chitosan (Va-g-Ch), was synthesized and used as a wall material for microencapsulation of fish oil. The sardine oil loaded Va-g-Ch microparticles could be a potential functional food ingredient considering the numerous health benefits of fish oil, chitosan, and vanillic acid. The current study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of sardine oil-loaded Va-g-Ch microparticles against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms. In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation was conducted using H9c2 cardiomyocytes. MTT assay revealed that effective cytoprotective effect was induced by a sample concentration of 12.5 μg/mL. Results of apoptosis by double fluorescent staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide and caspase-3 evaluation by ELISA substantiated the above findings. Further, flow cytometric determination of membrane potential, relative expression of NF-κB by PCR, and ROS determination using DCFH-DA also confirmed the protective effect of encapsulated sardine oil against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.

Abstract: Aberrant cellular cholesterol accumulation contributes to the pathophysiology of many diseases including neurodegenerative disorders such as Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) and Alzheimer's Disease1–4. Many aspects of cholesterol efflux from cells remain elusive. Here we describe the utility of cholesterol-rich giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) as a means to monitor cholesterol that is translocated to the plasma membrane for secretion. We demonstrate that small molecules known to enhance lipid efflux, including those in clinical trials for lipid storage disorders, enhance this GPMV formation. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of cholesterol efflux blocks GPMV formation. We show that microtubule stabilization via paclitaxel treatment and increased tubulin acetylation via HDAC6 inhibition promotes the formation of GPMVs with concomitant reduction in cellular cholesterol in a cell model of NPC disease. The pan-deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat, which has been shown to reduce the severity of cholesterol storage in NPC, elicited a similar response. Further, the disruption of actin polymerization inhibits the formation of GPMVs, whereas the small GTP-binding protein Arl4c promotes actin remodeling at sites overlapping with GPMV formation. Thus, monitoring the formation of GPMVs provides a new avenue to better understand diseases whose pathology may be sensitive to alterations in cellular cholesterol.

Abstract: Introduction
Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have been shown to enhance wound healing via their paracrine function. Exosomes, as one of the most important paracrine factors, play an essential role in this process. However, the concrete mechanisms that underlie this effect are poorly understood. In this study, we aim to explore the potential roles and molecular mechanisms of exosomes derived from ADSCs in cutaneous wound healing.
Methods
Normal human skin fibroblasts and ADSCs were isolated from patient skin and adipose tissues. ADSCs were characterized by using flow cytometric analysis and adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation assays. Exosomes were purified from human ADSCs by differential ultracentrifugation and identified by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking, fluorescence confocal microscopy and western blotting. Fibroblasts were treated with different concentrations of exosomes, and the synthesis of collagen was analyzed by western blotting; the levels of growth factors were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and ELISA; and the proliferation and migration abilities of fibroblasts were analyzed by real-time cell analysis, CCK-8 assays and scratch assays. A mouse model with a full-thickness incision wound was used to evaluate the effect of ADSC-derived exosomes on wound healing. The level of p-Akt/Akt was analyzed by western blotting. Ly294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) inhibitor, was used to identify the underlying mechanisms by which ADSC-derived exosomes promote wound healing.
Results
ADSC-derived exosomes were taken up by the fibroblasts, which showed significant, dose-dependent increases in cell proliferation and migration compared to the behavior of cells without exosome treatment. More importantly, both the mRNA and protein levels of type I collagen (Col 1), type III collagen (Col 3), MMP1, bFGF, and TGF-β1 were increased in fibroblasts after stimulation with exosomes. Furthermore, exosomes significantly accelerated wound healing in vivo and increased the level of p-Akt/Akt in vitro. However, Ly294002 alleviated these exosome-induced changes, suggesting that exosomes from ADSCs could promote and optimize collagen deposition in vitro and in vivo and further promote wound healing via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that ADSC-derived exosomes can promote fibroblast proliferation and migration and optimize collagen deposition via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to further accelerate wound healing. Our results suggest that ADSCs likely facilitate wound healing via the release of exosomes, and the PI3K/Akt pathway may play a role in this process. Our data also suggest that the clinical application of ADSC-derived exosomes may shed new light on the use of cell-free therapy to accelerate full-thickness skin wound healing and attenuate scar formation.

Abstract: The stimulatory heterotrimeric Gs protein alpha subunit (Gsα) is a ubiquitous guanine nucleotide-binding protein that regulates the intracellular cAMP signaling pathway and consequently participates in a wide range of biological events. In the reproductive system, despite Gsα being associated with oocyte meiotic arrest in vitro, the exact role of Gsα in female fertility in vivo remains largely unknown. Here, we generated oocyte-specific Gsα knockout mice by using the Cre/LoxP system. We observed that the deletion of Gsα caused complete female infertility. Exclusion of post-implantation abnormalities, oogenesis, fertilization, and early embryo development was subsequently monitored; meiosis in Gsα-deficient oocytes precociously resumed in only 43% of antral follicles from mutant mice, indicating that alteration of meiotic pause was not the key factor in infertility. Ovulation process and number were normal, but the rate of morphological abnormal oocytes was apparently increased; spindle organization, fertilization, and early embryo development were impaired. Furthermore, the level of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and the mitochondrial aggregation increased, and antioxidant glutathione (GSH) content, ATP level, mtDNA copy number, and mitochondrial membrane potential decreased in Gsα-deficient oocytes. GV oocytes from mutant mice showed early-stage apoptosis. Meanwhile, the Gsα knockout-induced decline in oocyte quality and low developmental potential was partially rescued by antioxidant supplementation. To sum up, our results are the first to reveal that the profile of Gsα oocyte-specific deletion caused female infertility in vivo, and oxidative stress plays an important role in this event.

Abstract: Summary
Due to differences across species, the mechanisms of cell fate decisions determined in mice cannot be readily extrapolated to humans. In this study, we developed a feeder- and xeno-free culture protocol that efficiently induced human pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into PLZF+/GPR125+/CD90+ spermatogonium-like cells (SLCs). These SLCs were enriched with key genes in germ cell development such as MVH, DAZL, GFRα1, NANOS3, and DMRT1. In addition, a small fraction of SLCs went through meiosis in vitro to develop into haploid cells. We further demonstrated that this chemically defined induction protocol faithfully recapitulated the features of compromised germ cell development of PSCs with NANOS3 deficiency or iPSC lines established from patients with non-obstructive azoospermia. Taken together, we established a powerful experimental platform to investigate human germ cell development and pathology related to male infertility.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibiting protein function selectively is a major goal of modern drug discovery. Here, we report a previously understudied benefit of small molecule proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases to target proteins for their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Using promiscuous CRBN- and VHL-recruiting PROTACs that bind >50 kinases, we show that only a subset of bound targets is degraded. The basis of this selectivity relies on protein-protein interactions between the E3 ubiquitin ligase and the target protein, as illustrated by engaged proteins that are not degraded as a result of unstable ternary complexes with PROTAC-recruited E3 ligases. In contrast, weak PROTAC:target protein affinity can be stabilized by high-affinity target:PROTAC:ligase trimer interactions, leading to efficient degradation. This study highlights design guidelines for generating potent PROTACs as well as possibilities for degrading undruggable proteins immune to traditional small-molecule inhibitors.

Abstract: An α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compound of ginger, 6-Shogaol (6S), induced extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death in breast cancer cell (MDA-MB-231) and non-small lung cancer (A549) cells. In the presence of autophagic inhibitors the cells continued to exhibit cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death clearly distinguishing it from the classic autophagic process. 6S induced death did not exhibit the characteristic apoptotic features like caspase cleavage, phosphatidyl serine exposure and DNA fragmentation. The immunofluorescence with the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) resident protein, calreticulin indicated that the vacuoles were of ER origin, typical of paraptosis. This was supported by the increase in level of microtubule associated protein light chain 3B (LC3 I and LC3 II) and polyubiquitin binding protein, p62. The level of ER stress markers like polyubiquitinated proteins, Bip and CHOP also consistently increased. We have found that 6S inhibits the 26S proteasome. The proteasomal inhibitory activity was elucidated by a) molecular docking of 6S onto the active site of β5 subunit and b) reduced fluorescence by the fluorogenic substrate of the chymotrypsin-like subunit. In conclusion these studies demonstrate for the first time that proteasomal inhibition by 6S induces cell death via paraptosis. So 6-shogaol may act as a template for anti-cancer lead discovery against the apoptosis resistant cancer cells.

Abstract: Extensive scar tissue formation often occurs after severe burn injury, trauma, or as one of complications after surgical intervention. Despite significant therapeutic advances, it is still a significant challenge to manage massive scar tissue formation while also promoting normal wound healing. The goal of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) that were genetically modified to overexpress transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-β3), an inhibitor of myofibroblast proliferation and collagen type I deposition, on full-thickness cutaneous wound healing in a rabbit model. Twenty-four rabbits with surgically-induced full-thickness cutaneous wounds created on the external ear (1.5 × 1.5 cm, two wounds/ear) were randomized into four groups: (G1), wounds with no special treatment but common serum-free culture medium as negative controls; (G2), topically-applied recombinant adenovirus, expressing TGF-β3/GFP; (G3), topically-applied BMSCs alone; (G4), topically-applied BMSCs transfected with Ad-TGF-β3/GFP (BMSCsTGF-β3); and (G5), an additional normal control (n = 2) with neither wound nor treatment on the external ear skin. The sizes of wounds on the ear tissues were grossly examined, and the scar depth and density of wounds were histologically evaluated 21, 45, and 90 days after surgical wound creation. Our results demonstrated that G4 significantly reduced the wound scar depth and density, compared to G1~3. Numbers of cells expressing GFP significantly increased in G4, compared to G2. The protein expression of TGF-β3 and type III collagen in G4 significantly increased, while the ratio of type I to type III collagen was also significantly reduced, which is similar to the tissue architecture found in G5, as compared the other treatment groups. In conclusion, transplantation of BMSCsTGF-β3 remarkably improves wound healing and reduces skin scar tissue formation in an animal model, which may potentially provide an alternative in the treatment of extensive scar tissue formation after soft tissue injury.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in breast cancer cell biological processes, including proliferation and apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of their target genes. Herein, we reported that miR-630 overexpression initiates apoptosis, blocks cell cycle progression and suppresses cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, BMI1, a member of polycomb group family, was identified as a direct target of miR-630, and there was a negative correlation between the expression levels of BMI1 and miR-630 in human breast cancer samples. With a series of biology approaches, subsequently, we proved that BMI1 was a functional downstream target of miR-630 and mediated the property of miR-630-dependent inhibition of breast cancer progression. Taken together, these findings provide further evidence on the tumor-suppression function of miR-630 in breast cancer, and clarify BMI1 as a novel functional target gene of miR-630.

Abstract: The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is one component of a highly complex and interactive cellular proteostasis network (PN) that participates in protein folding, directs misfolded and damaged proteins for destruction, and participates in regulating cellular transcriptional responses to environmental stress, thus promoting cell and organismal survival. Over the last 20 years, it has become clear that various disease states, including cancer, neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders, and infection by diverse microbes, impact the PN. Among PN components, Hsp90 was among the first to be pharmacologically targeted with small molecules. While the number of Hsp90 inhibitors described in the literature has dramatically increased since the first such small molecule was described in 1994, it has become increasingly apparent that not all of these agents have been sufficiently validated for specificity, mechanism of action, and lack of off-target effects. Given the less than expected activity of Hsp90 inhibitors in cancer-related human clinical trials, a re-evaluation of potentially confounding off-target effects, as well as confidence in target specificity and mechanism of action, is warranted. In this commentary, we provide feasible approaches to achieve these goals and we discuss additional considerations to improve the clinical efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors in treating cancer and other diseases.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are both potent immune-modulators. The aberrant proliferation and function of Tregs plays an important role in the development of asthma. Our previous studies have demonstrated the role of MSCs in promoting proliferation and immune-modulating of Tregs, as well as alleviating airway inflammation of asthmatic mice. In the present study, we isolated exosomes secreted by MSCs and investigated their immunomodulation effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of asthmatic patient. We found that MSC exosomes upregulated IL-10 and TGF-β1 from PBMCs, thus promoting proliferation and immune-suppression capacity of Tregs. Furthermore, antigen presenting cells (APCs) but not CD4+ T cells-dependent pathway was shown to be possible mechanism involved in MSC exosome-mediated regulation. Our data elucidated the key role of exosomes in immune-modulation of MSCs, and suggested the therapeutic potential of MSC exosomes for asthma.

Abstract: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to neovasculogenesis and reendothelialization of damaged blood vessels to maintain the endothelium. Dysfunction of EPCs is implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular injury induced by homocysteine (Hcy). We aimed to investigate the role of Cyclin A in Hcy-induced EPCs dysfunction and explore its molecular mechanism. In this study, by treatment of EPCs with Hcy, we found that the expression of Cyclin A mRNA and protein were significantly downregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of Cyclin A prominently reduced proliferation of EPCs, while over-expression of Cyclin A significantly promoted the cell proliferation, suggesting that Hcy inhibits EPCs proliferation through downregulation of Cyclin A expression. In addition, epigenetic study also demonstrated that Hcy induces DNA hypomethylation of the Cyclin A promoter in EPCs through downregulated expression of DNMT1. Moreover, we found that Hcy treatment of EPCs leads to increased SAM, SAH and MeCP2, while the ratio of SAM/SAH and MBD expression decrease. In summary, our results indicate that Hcy inhibits Cyclin A expression through hypomethylation of Cyclin A and thereby suppress EPCs proliferation. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of DNA methylation mediated by DNMT1 in prevention of Hcy associated cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Disulfiram (DSF) in combination with copper (Cu) has been reported to override drug resistance in cancer cells, and DSF combined with chemotherapy based on the microtubule inhibitor vinorelbine appears to prolong survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying these findings. DSF/Cu reversed the microtubule inhibitor resistance in A549/Taxol and KB/VCR cells in vitro, and had anti-tumor effects in A549/Taxol and KB/VCR xenograft mice. DSF/Cu and DSF reduced the cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics of drug-resistant A549/Taxol and KB/VCR cells, including sphere formation, colony generation and migration, and DSF/Cu was more effective than DSF alone. DSF/Cu also decreased the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and the expression of P-gp and stem cell transcription factors in A549/Taxol and KB/VCR cells. Knockdown of ALDH2 attenuated the CSC characteristics of resistant cancer cells and enhanced their sensitivity to Taxol or VCR. Importantly, DSF/Cu treatment inhibited the expression of ALDH2 in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that DSF/Cu reverses microtubule inhibitor resistance in cancer cells by suppressing ALDH2 expression, and Cu improves the activity of DSF.

Abstract: Previous study found the variable miR-3202 as a potential biomarker in smoker with or without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study aims to identify the molecular involvement of miR-3202 in the pathophysiology of COPD. Level of miR-3202 in blood sample of non-smoker non-COPD(C), smoker without COPD(S), smoker with stable COPD(S-COPD) and smoker with acute exacerbation COPD(AE-COPD) was observed by quantitative real-time PCR. By bioinformatics prediction, Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2) was identified as a potential target of miR-3202. In vitro, human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) stimulated T lymphocytes were co-cultured. Cell proliferation and apoptosis of HBE cells were determinated. In vivo, rats were exposed in cigarette smoke for 30 days and expression of miR-3202 and FAIM2 in bronchia were detected. Results showed that The miR-3202 was down-regulated in S, S-COPD and AE-COPD group when compared with C group. Decreased level of miR-3202 was also observed in CSE treated T lymphocyte. Additionally, CSE stimulation increased INF-γ and TNF-α levels and FAIM2 expression whereas inhibited Fas and FasL expressions in T lymphocytes. However, these effects were significantly suppressed by miR-3202 overexpression and enhanced by miR-3202 inhibitor. Likely to exogenous miR-3202, FAIM2 knockdown significantly inhibited HBE cells apoptosis, as well as inhibited INF-γ and TNF-α levels. In COPD rats model, miR-3202 was reduced while FAIM2 was up-regulated accordingly. Here, results suggest that high level miR-3202 in T lymphocytes may protect epithelial cells through targeting FAIM2. MiR-3202 might be used as a notable biomarker of COPD.

Abstract: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) caused by excessive alcohol consumption is associated with oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hepatocellular apoptosis. Cilostazol, a licensed clinical drug used to treat intermittent claudication, has been reported to act as a protective agent in a spectrum of diseases. However, little information regarding its role in ethanol-induced hepatocellular toxicity has been reported. In the current study, we investigated the protective effects and mechanisms of cilostazol on ethanol-induced hepatocytic injury. Rat primary hepatocytes were pretreated with cilostazol prior to ethanol treatment. MTT and LDH assay indicated that ethanol-induced cell death was ameliorated by cilostazol in a dose-dependent manner. Our results display that overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) induced by ethanol was attenuated by pretreatment with cilostazol. Furthermore, cilostazol significantly inhibited ethanol-induced generation of ROS in mitochondria. Importantly, it was shown that cilostazol could improve mitochondrial function in primary hepatocytes by restoring the levels of ATP and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Additionally, cilostazol was found to reduce apoptosis induced by ethanol using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Mechanistically, we found that cilostazol prevented mitochondrial pathway-mediated apoptotic signals by reversing the expression of Bax and Bcl2, the level of cleaved caspase-3, and attenuating cytochrome C release. These findings suggest the possibility of novel ALD therapies using cilostazol.

Abstract: As a primate-specific microRNA, miR-637 has been discovered for nearly 10 years. Our previous study demonstrated that miR-637 acted as a suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its biomedical significance in pancreatic cancer remains obscure. In the present study, miR-637 was found to be significantly downregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines and most of the PDAC specimens. Furthermore, the enforced overexpression of miR-637 dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of PDAC cells. Akt1, as a serine/threonine-protein kinase, has been identified as an oncogene in multiple cancers including pancreatic cancer. Our data confirmed that Akt1 was a novel target for miR-637, and its knockdown also induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in PDAC cells. In conclusion, our data indicated that miR-637 acted as a tumor-suppressor in PDAC, and the suppressive effect was mediated, at least partially, by suppressing Akt1 expression.

Abstract: Insect nephrocytes provide a valuable model for kidney disease, as they are structurally and functionally homologous to mammalian kidney podocytes. They possess an exceptional macromolecular assembly, the nephrocyte diaphragm (ND), which serves as a filtration barrier and helps maintain tissue homeostasis by filtering out wastes and toxic products. However, the elements that maintain nephrocyte architecture and the ND are not understood. We show that Drosophila nephrocytes have a unique cytoplasmic cluster of F-actin, which is maintained by the microtubule cytoskeleton and Rho-GTPases. A balance of Rac1 and Cdc42 activity as well as proper microtubule organization and endoplasmic reticulum structure, are required to position the actin cluster. Further, ND proteins Sns and Duf also localize to this cluster and regulate organization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Perturbation of any of these inter-dependent components impairs nephrocyte ultrafiltration. Thus cytoskeletal components, Rho-GTPases and ND proteins work in concert to maintain the specialized nephrocyte architecture and function.

Abstract: Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been described in postmortem brain samples and animal models. However, these observations were made at a late stage of disease and the inability to examine an early, presymptomatic phase in human neurons impeded our understanding of cause or consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. We used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal cells (iN cells) from sporadic AD (SAD) patients and healthy control subjects (HCS) to show aberrant mitochondrial function in patient-derived cells. We observed that neuronal cultures from some patients produced more ROS and displayed higher levels of DNA damage. Furthermore, patient-derived cells showed increased levels of oxidative phosphorylation chain complexes, whereas mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins were not affected. Surprisingly, these effects neither correlated with Aβ nor phosphorylated and total tau levels. Synaptic protein levels were also unaffected in SAD iN cells. The results of this study give new insights into constitutional metabolic changes in neurons from subjects prone to develop Alzheimer's pathology. They suggest that increased ROS production may have an integral role in the development of sporadic AD prior to the appearance of amyloid and tau pathology.

Abstract: Summary
The SRPK family of kinases regulates pre-mRNA splicing by phosphorylating serine/arginine (SR)-rich splicing factors, signals splicing control in response to extracellular stimuli, and contributes to tumorigenesis, suggesting that these splicing kinases are potential therapeutic targets. Here, we report the development of the first irreversible SRPK inhibitor, SRPKIN-1, which is also the first kinase inhibitor that forms a covalent bond with a tyrosine phenol group in the ATP-binding pocket. Kinome-wide profiling demonstrates its selectivity for SRPK1/2, and SRPKIN-1 attenuates SR protein phosphorylation at submicromolar concentrations. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a known target for SRPK-regulated splicing and, relative to the first-generation SRPK inhibitor SRPIN340 or small interfering RNA-mediated SRPK knockdown, SRPKIN-1 is more potent in converting the pro-angiogenic VEGF-A165a to the anti-angiogenic VEGF-A165b isoform and in blocking laser-induced neovascularization in a murine retinal model. These findings encourage further development of SRPK inhibitors for treatment of age-related macular degeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) cardiomyocytes (CMs) show less negative resting membrane potential (RMP), which is attributed to small inward rectifier currents (IK1). Here, IK1 was measured in hiPSC-CMs (proprietary and commercial cell line) cultured as monolayer (ML) or 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) and, for direct comparison, in CMs from human right atrial (RA) and left ventricular (LV) tissue. RMP was measured in isolated cells and intact tissues. IK1 density in ML- and EHT-CMs from the proprietary line was similar to LV and RA, respectively. IK1 density in EHT-CMs from the commercial line was 2-fold smaller than in the proprietary line. RMP in EHT of both lines was similar to RA and LV. Repolarization fraction and IK,ACh response discriminated best between RA and LV and indicated predominantly ventricular phenotype in hiPSC-CMs/EHT. The data indicate that IK1 is not necessarily low in hiPSC-CMs, and technical issues may underlie low RMP in hiPSC-CMs.

Abstract: Summary
The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family is involved in various functions with maintenance of chromatin structure. During murine somatic cell reprogramming, we find that early depletion of HP1γ reduces the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, while late depletion enhances the process, with a concomitant change from a centromeric to nucleoplasmic localization and elongation-associated histone H3.3 enrichment. Depletion of heterochromatin anchoring protein SENP7 increased reprogramming efficiency to a similar extent as HP1γ, indicating the importance of HP1γ release from chromatin for pluripotency acquisition. HP1γ interacted with OCT4 and DPPA4 in HP1α and HP1β knockouts and in H3K9 methylation depleted H3K9M embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines. HP1α and HP1γ complexes in ESCs differed in association with histones, the histone chaperone CAF1 complex, and specific components of chromatin-modifying complexes such as DPY30, implying distinct functional contributions. Taken together, our results reveal the complex contribution of the HP1 proteins to pluripotency.

Abstract: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are increasingly implicated in the prevention and treatment of cancers apart from their known inhibitory effects on eicosanoid production. One of the NSAIDs, indomethacin, in particular shows promising antineoplastic outcome against glioma. To extend such finding, we here studied in human H4 and U87 glioma cells the possible involvement of the ceramide/protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A)/Akt axis in the indomethacin-induced apoptosis. We found that the induced apoptosis was accompanied by a series of biochemical events, including intracellular ceramide generation, PP2A activation, Akt dephosphorylation, Mcl-1 and FLICE inhibiting protein (FLIP) transcriptional downregulation, Bax mitochondrial distribution, and caspase 3 activation. Such events were also duplicated with a cell-permeable C2-ceramide and Akt inhibitor LY294002. Pharmacological inhibition of ceramide synthase by fumonisin B1 and PP2A by okadaic acid moderately attenuated indomethacin-induced Akt dephosphorylation along with the apoptosis. Results suggested that the ceramide/PP2A/Akt axis is involved in the apoptosis and a possible cyclooxygenase-independent target for indomethacin. Furthermore, apoptosis regulatory proteins such as Mcl-1 and FLIP are potential downstream effectors of this axis and their downregulation could turn on the apoptotic program.

Abstract: Glucose-regulated protein 78(GRP78) and the ubiquitin-like protein FAT10 each promote proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). However, the relationship of GRP78 and FAT10 in HCC proliferation are still not known. In this study, we found that GRP78 and FAT10 were significantly overexpressed in HCC tissues compare with adjacent non-cancerous tissues, and a positive correlation was found between their expression and associated proliferation characteristics. High expression of GRP78 and FAT10 were positively correlated with tumor proliferation and poor prognosis in HCC. Moreover, GRP78 knockdown reduced FAT10 expression and suppressed HCC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The effects of GRP78 knockdown were rescued by FAT10 up-regulation, whereas FAT10 knockdown reduced HCC proliferation enhanced by GRP78 up-regulation. Furthermore, GRP78 modulated FAT10 expression by regulating the NF-κB pathway, direct activation of the NF-κB pathway increased the expression of FAT10, a gene counteracting the tumor suppressor p53. Taken together, these results suggest that this newly identified GRP78–NF-κB–FAT10 axis will provide novel insight into the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of proliferation in human HCC.

Abstract: Acquired radioresistance compromises the efficacy of radiotherapy for carcinomas including esophageal cancer (EC), thus resulting in recurrence and poor survival. Recent research corroborated radiosensitive function of simvastatin in stem-like breast cancer cells. However, its role in EC radioresistance remains poorly elucidated. Here, we developed a radioresistant EC cell line Ec9706-R with higher resistance to irradiation relative to control Ec9706 cells. Intriguingly, Ec9706-R cells exhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics with high invasion and migration ability. Simvastatin sensitized radioresistance of Ec9706-R cells and suppressed cell proliferation, but aggravated radiation-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, simvastatin reversed EMT and inhibited cell invasion and migration of Ec9706-R cells. Mechanism assay confirmed the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway after radiation, which was inhibited by simvastatin. After restoring this pathway by its activator, IGF-1, simvastatin-mediated radiosensitivity and EMT reversion were abrogated. Further assay substantiated the PTEN suppression after irradiation, which was elevated following simvastatin pre-treatment. Moreover, PTEN cessation attenuated the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on PI3K/AKT activation, and subsequently antagonized simvastatin-induced radiosensitivity and EMT reversion. Additionally, simvastatin aggravated radiation-mediated Ec9706-R tumor growth inhibition. Together, simvastatin inhibits the development of Ec9706-R cells by increasing radiosensitivity and reversing EMT via PTEN-PI3K/AKT pathway, implying a promising strategy against EC radioresistance.

Abstract: Bovine milk is rich in exosomes, which contain abundant miRNAs and play important roles in the regulation of neonatal growth and development of adaptive immunity. Here, we analyzed miRNA expression profiles of bovine milk exosomes from three healthy and three mastitic cows, and then six miRNA libraries were constructed. Interestingly, we detected no scRNAs and few snRNAs in milk exosomes; this result indicated a potential preference for RNA packaging in milk exosomes. A total of 492 known and 980 novel exosomal miRNAs were detected, and the 10 most expressed miRNAs in the six samples accounted for 80–90% of total miRNA-associated reads. Expression analyses identified 18 miRNAs with significantly different expression between healthy and infected animals; the predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were significantly enriched in immune system process, response to stimulus, growth, etc. Moreover, target genes were significantly enriched in several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways including inflammatory, immune, and cancer pathways. Our survey provided comprehensive information about milk exosomes and exosomal miRNAs involved in mastitis. Moreover, the differentially expressed miRNAs, especially miR-223 and miR-142-5p, could be considered as potential candidates for mastitis.

Abstract: Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid protein that is highly conserved among higher and lower eukaryotes. The polyubiquitin gene UBI4 encodes a unique precursor protein that contains five ubiquitin repeats organized in a head-to-tail arrangement. Although the involvement of the yeast polyubiquitin gene UBI4 in the stress response was reported long ago, there are no reports regarding the underlying mechanism of this involvement. In this study, we used UBI4-deletion and UBI4-overexpressing yeast strains as models to explore the potential mechanism by which UBI4 protects yeast cells against paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Here, we show that ubi4Δ cells exhibit oxidative stress, an apoptotic phenotype, and a decreased replicative lifespan. Additionally, the reduced resistance of ubi4Δ cells to paraquat that was observed in this study was rescued by overexpression of either the catalase or the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2. We also demonstrated that only SOD2 overexpression restored the replicative lifespan of ubi4Δ cells. In contrast to the case of ubi4Δ cells, UBI4 overexpression in wild-type yeast increases the yeast’s resistance to paraquat, and this overexpression is associated with large pools of expressed ubiquitin and increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins. Collectively, these findings highlight the role of the polyubiquitin gene UBI4 in apoptosis and implicate UBI4 as a modulator of the replicative lifespan.

Abstract: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant disorder of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Majority of patients can be effectively treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, but a portion of patients will develop drug resistance. Accumulated evidences have identified exosomes in cancer as promoters of tumor progression. Herein, we found that exosomes derived from imatinib resistant CML cells can be internalized into sensitive CML cells and confer drug-resistance traits. We also demonstrated a significant higher level of miR-365 in exosomes derived from drug-resistant CML cells compared with those from sensitive ones using microarray and qRT-PCR. The imatinib sensitive CML cells transfected with pre-miR-365 displayed lower chemosensitivity and apoptosis rate compared with controls. We further confirmed that exosomal transfer of miR-365 induced drug resistance by inhibiting expression of pro-apoptosis protein in sensitive CML cells. In conclusion, our study reveals that exosomes mediate a horizontal transfer of drug-resistant trait in chronic myeloid leukemia cell by delivering miR-365.

Abstract: Exposure to sublethal heat stress activates a complex cascade of signaling events, such as activators (NO), signal molecules (PKCε), and mediators (HSP70 and COX-2), leading to implementation of heat preconditioning, an adaptive mechanism which makes the organism more tolerant to additional stress. We investigated the time frame in which these chemical signals are triggered after heat stress (41 ± 0.5°С/45 min), single or repeated (24 or 72 h after the first one) in heart tissue of male Wistar rats. The animals were allowed to recover 24, 48 or 72 h at room temperature. Single heat stress caused a significant increase of the concentration of HSP70, NO, and PKC level and decrease of COX-2 level 24 h after the heat stress, which in the next course of recovery gradually normalized. The second heat stress, 24 h after the first one, caused a significant reduction of the HSP70 levels, concentration of NO and PKCɛ, and significant increase of COX-2 concentration. The second exposure, 72 h after the first heat stress, caused more expressive changes of HSP70 and NO in the 24 h-recovery groups. The level of PKCɛ was not significantly changed, but there was significantly increased COX-2 concentration during recovery. Serum activity of AST, ALT, and CK was reduced after single exposure and increased after repeated exposure to heat stress, in both time intervals. In conclusion, a longer period of recovery (72 h) between two consecutive sessions of heat stress is necessary to achieve more expressive changes in mediators (HSP70) and triggers (NO) of heat preconditioning.

Abstract: Summary
Pro-carcinogenic bacteria have the potential to initiate and/or promote colon cancer, in part via immune mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Using ApcMin mice colonized with the human pathobiont enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) as a model of microbe-induced colon tumorigenesis, we show that the Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT) triggers a pro-carcinogenic, multi-step inflammatory cascade requiring IL-17R, NF-κB, and Stat3 signaling in colonic epithelial cells (CECs). Although necessary, Stat3 activation in CECs is not sufficient to trigger ETBF colon tumorigenesis. Notably, IL-17-dependent NF-κB activation in CECs induces a proximal to distal mucosal gradient of C-X-C chemokines, including CXCL1, that mediates the recruitment of CXCR2-expressing polymorphonuclear immature myeloid cells with parallel onset of ETBF-mediated distal colon tumorigenesis. Thus, BFT induces a pro-carcinogenic signaling relay from the CEC to a mucosal Th17 response that results in selective NF-κB activation in distal colon CECs, which collectively triggers myeloid-cell-dependent distal colon tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Recently, mitochondrial dysfunction has been indicated as an established risk factor for the development of renal fibrosis. However, whether PGC-1α is involved in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis is unknown. In this study, we treated NRK-49F (normal rat kidney fibroblast) cells with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) for 24 h to establish an in vitro fibrosis model. TGF-β1 induced the upregulation of type I collagen, fibronectin, TGF-β receptor I (TGFβ-RI), TGFβ-RII, Smad4, and pSmad2/3, as well as PGC-1α. NRK-49F cells transfected with pcDNA-PGC-1α showed significantly increased expression of fibronectin and type I collagen, as revealed by western blot assay. Interestingly, transfection with PGC-1α-siRNA caused a stark reversal of TGF-β1-induced cellular fibrosis, with concomitant suppression of fibronectin and type I collagen, as revealed by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Moreover, SB431542 (TGFβ-RI), LY294002 (PI3K/Akt), and SB203580 (p38 MAPK), inhibitors of TGF-β-associated pathways, markedly suppressed TGF-β1-induced PGC-1α upregulation. These results implicate a role of PGC-1α in renal interstitial fibrosis mediated via the TGFβ-RI, PI3K/Akt, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our findings that PGC-1α-siRNA downregulates fibronectin and type I collagen suggest that it can be used as a novel molecular treatment for renal fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Energy metabolism is a key aspect of cardiomyocyte biology. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are a promising tool for biomedical application, but they are immature and have not undergone metabolic maturation related to early postnatal development. To assess whether cultivation of hiPSC-CMs in 3D engineered heart tissue format leads to maturation of energy metabolism, we analyzed the mitochondrial and metabolic state of 3D hiPSC-CMs and compared it with 2D culture. 3D hiPSC-CMs showed increased mitochondrial mass, DNA content, and protein abundance (proteome). While hiPSC-CMs exhibited the principal ability to use glucose, lactate, and fatty acids as energy substrates irrespective of culture format, hiPSC-CMs in 3D performed more oxidation of glucose, lactate, and fatty acid and less anaerobic glycolysis. The increase in mitochondrial mass and DNA in 3D was diminished by pharmacological reduction of contractile force. In conclusion, contractile work contributes to metabolic maturation of hiPSC-CMs.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic deficiency of dystrophin leads to disability and premature death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), affecting the heart as well as skeletal muscle. Here, we report that clinical-stage cardiac progenitor cells, known as cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), improve cardiac and skeletal myopathy in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Injection of CDCs into the hearts of mdx mice augments cardiac function, ambulatory capacity, and survival. Exosomes secreted by human CDCs reproduce the benefits of CDCs in mdx mice and in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived Duchenne cardiomyocytes. Surprisingly, CDCs and their exosomes also transiently restored partial expression of full-length dystrophin in mdx mice.

Abstract: Summary
The AIM2 inflammasome is activated by DNA, leading to caspase-1 activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, which are critical mediators in host innate immune responses against various pathogens. Some viruses employ strategies to counteract inflammasome-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but their in vivo relevance is less well understood. Here we show that the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) tegument protein VP22 inhibits AIM2-dependent inflammasome activation. VP22 interacts with AIM2 and prevents its oligomerization, an initial step in AIM2 inflammasome activation. A mutant virus lacking VP22 (HSV-1ΔVP22) activates AIM2 and induces IL-1β and IL-18 secretion, but these responses are lost in the absence of AIM2. Additionally, HSV-1ΔVP22 infection results in diminished viral yields in vivo, but HSV-1ΔVP22 replication is largely restored in AIM2-deficient mice. Collectively, these findings reveal a mechanism of HSV-1 evasion of the host immune response that enables efficient viral replication in vivo.

Abstract: Mammary epithelial cells (MECs) in lactating mammary glands produce milk lipid, which provides a large percentage of calories and bioactive lipids for appropriate infant growth. However, secreted milk lipid is often reduced concurrently with increases in IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in mammary glands with mastitis. In this study, we investigated whether those cytokines directly influenced lipid production and secretion. A lactating MEC culture model with high lipid production ability was prepared by culture with oleic acid. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 differentially affected lipid production and secretion in lactating MECs. In particular, IL-1β treatment significantly reduced amounts of secreted triglycerides by 97% compared with the control concurrently with enlargement of cytoplasmic lipid droplets in MECs. IL-1β also decreased mRNA expression of Fabp3 and Srebp1 and the amount of aquaporin 3, GLUT-1 and adipophilin in the milk lipid production pathway. Furthermore, IL-1β inactivated STAT5 and glucocorticoid signaling to induce milk production in MECs, whereas STAT3 and NFκB signaling was activated. IL-1β induced mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in MECs. Therefore, we suggest that IL-1β is a key inhibitor of lipid production and secretion in lactating MECs.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical strategies to block quorum sensing (QS) could provide a route to attenuate virulence in bacterial pathogens. Considerable research has focused on this approach in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which uses the LuxR-type receptor LasR to regulate much of its QS network. Non-native ligands that antagonize LasR have been developed, yet we have little understanding of the mode by which these compounds interact with LasR and alter its function, as the receptor is unstable in their presence. Herein, we report an approach to circumvent this challenge through the study of a series of synthetic LasR agonists with varying levels of potency. Structural investigations of these ligands with the LasR ligand-binding domain reveal that certain agonists can enforce a conformation that deviates from that observed for other, often more potent agonists. These results, when combined with cell-based and biophysical analyses, suggest a functional model for LasR that could guide future ligand design.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common form of thyroid cancer and while it has a generally good prognosis, tumor recurrence remains a major clinical challenge. Studying laboratory cell lines as well as clinical specimens indicate that PTC may follow the cancer stem cell (CSC) model. However, CSC characteristics relevant in PTC initiation and progression remain largely unknown. Here we studied a population of sphere-growing tumor cells isolated from primary cultures of clinical PTC. These sphere-growing cells consisted of aldehyde dehydrogenase positive (ALDH+) and ALDH negative (ALDH-) cell subpopulations and demonstrated a hierarchical pattern of cell division. Using combinations of selective depletion, specific inhibition and cell sorting, we found that both subpopulations of the sphere cells were able to self-renew and initiate xenograft tumors independently, and fulfilled the definition of CSC. Importantly, when the subpopulations functioned together, the cancer-initiation efficiency and the xenograft tumor progression were significantly enhanced compared to either subpopulation alone. These data revealed crucial roles of ALDH- CSC in PTC biology and suggested that CSC subpopulations function cooperatively to control PTC initiation and progression. Together, our study indicates that CSC subpopulations isolated from clinical specimens offer unprecedented opportunities for investigating PTC pathogenesis and developing effective therapies.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are currently recognized as crucial players in nervous system development, function and pathology. In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), identification of causative mutations in FUS and TDP-43 or hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 point to the essential role of aberrant RNA metabolism in neurodegeneration. In this study, by taking advantage of an in vitro differentiation system generating mouse motor neurons (MNs) from embryonic stem cells, we identified and characterized the long non-coding transcriptome of MNs. Moreover, by using mutant mouse MNs carrying the equivalent of one of the most severe ALS-associated FUS alleles (P517L), we identified lncRNAs affected by this mutation. Comparative analysis with human MNs derived in vitro from induced pluripotent stem cells indicated that candidate lncRNAs are conserved between mouse and human. Our work provides a global view of the long non-coding transcriptome of MN, as a prerequisite toward the comprehension of the still poorly characterized non-coding side of MN physiopathology.

Abstract: Summary
Investigation of human muscle regeneration requires robust methods to purify and transplant muscle stem and progenitor cells that collectively constitute the human satellite cell (HuSC) pool. Existing approaches have yet to make HuSCs widely accessible for researchers, and as a result human muscle stem cell research has advanced slowly. Here, we describe a robust and predictable HuSC purification process that is effective for each human skeletal muscle tested and the development of storage protocols and transplantation models in dystrophin-deficient and wild-type recipients. Enzymatic digestion, magnetic column depletion, and 6-marker flow-cytometric purification enable separation of 104 highly enriched HuSCs per gram of muscle. Cryostorage of HuSCs preserves viability, phenotype, and transplantation potential. Development of enhanced and species-specific transplantation protocols enabled serial HuSC xenotransplantation and recovery. These protocols and models provide an accessible system for basic and translational investigation and clinical development of HuSCs.

Abstract: E-peptide of the pro-Insulin-like growth factor-I (pro-IGF-I) is produced from pre-pro-IGF-I by proteolytic cleavage in the post-translational processing. The human Eb-peptide (hEb-peptide), derived from the E domain of pro-IGF-IB isoform, is a bioactive molecule whose exact physiological role remains elusive. Accumulated evidence reported from our laboratory indicated that hEb-peptide possesses activity against multiple hallmark characteristics of solid tumor in different cancer cell types. In human breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231), it was demonstrated that hEb-peptide can promote cell attachment to substratum, inhibit colony formation in a semisolid medium, reduce cancer cell invasion, and inhibit cancer-induced angiogenesis. Like the action of other peptide hormones, these cellular responses triggered by hEb may be initiated through binding to a receptor molecule residing on the surface of the cell. Our laboratory and the others have previously provided evidence demonstrating the existence of hEb-peptide specific binding components residing on the cell membrane. In this study, we report the isolation and identification of eight protein molecules bound reversibly with hEb-peptide from the membrane preparation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Some of the identified proteins are known to be present at cell surface and function as receptors while the others are not. The functions of these molecules reveal strong correlation with the demonstrated activities of hEb-peptide on MDA-MB-231cells, suggesting hEb-peptide activity on cancer cells might be mediated by these molecules.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiate into multiple cell types during organismal development. Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) signaling induces differentiation from ESCs via the phosphorylation of downstream molecules such as mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). The FGF4-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway is inhibited to maintain ESCs in the undifferentiated state. However, the inhibitory mechanism of the FGF4-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in ESCs is uncharacterized. O-linked β-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) is a post-translational modification characterized by the attachment of a single N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the serine and threonine residues of nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins. Here, we showed that the O-GlcNAc on the phosphorylation site of PKCζ inhibits PKCζ phosphorylation (activation) and, consequently, the FGF4-PKCζ-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in ESCs. Our results demonstrate the mechanism for the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of ESCs via the inhibition of the FGF4-PKCζ-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway by O-GlcNAcylation on PKCζ.

Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy. CC treatment options are very limited especially for patients with distant metastasis. Kangai 1 C-terminal interacting tetraspanin (KITENIN) is highly expressed in numerous cancers, but the role of KITENIN in CC remains unknown. Here, we have investigated for the first time the function of KITENIN in human CC cell lines (TFK-1, SZ-1), tissues and a CC mouse model (Alb-Cre/LSL-KRASG12D/p53L/L). KITENIN was expressed in 92.2% of human CC tissues, in murine CC samples and also in human CC cell lines. Knockdown of KITENIN by small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively reduced proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation in both intra- and extra-hepatic CC cells. The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers like N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail and Slug were suppressed in KITENIN knockdown CC cells. Our results indicate that KITENIN is crucial for cholangiocarcinogenesis and it might become a potential therapeutic target for human CC treatment.

Abstract: Coronary artery spasm (CAS) is a pathophysiological phenomenon that may cause myocardial infarction and lead to circulatory collapse and death. Aberrant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress causes accumulation of misfolding proteins and has been reported to be involved in a variety of vascular diseases. The present study investigated the role of ER stress in the development of CAS and explored the possible molecular mechanisms. Initially, it was found that ER stress markers were elevated in response to drug-induced vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contraction. Pharmacologic activation of ER stress using Tunicamycin (Tm) persistently induced CAS and significantly promoted Pituitrin-induced CAS in mice as well as in a collagen gel contraction assay. On the contrary, pharmacologic inhibition of ER stress using 4-phenylacetic acid (4-PBA) completely blunted Pituitrin-induced CAS development in mice. Moreover, during the drug-induced VSMCs contraction, expression of ER stress markers were increased in parallel to those of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and phosphor-MLC2 (p-MLC2, at Ser19). After inhibiting MLCK activity by using its specific inhibitor ML-7, the ER stress activator Tm failed to activate the MLCK/MLC2 pathway and could neither trigger CAS in mice nor induce VSMCs contraction in vitro. Our results suggested that aberrant ER stress mediated CAS via regulating the MLCK/MLC2 pathway. ER stress activators might be more robust than the common drugs (Pituitrin or acetylcholine) as to induce vasocontraction and thus may serve as potential therapeutics against chronic bleeding, while its inhibitor might be useful for treatment of severe CAS caused by other medication.

Abstract: Summary
Knowledge of the full target space of bioactive substances, approved and investigational drugs as well as chemical probes, provides important insights into therapeutic potential and possible adverse effects. The existing compound-target bioactivity data resources are often incomparable due to non-standardized and heterogeneous assay types and variability in endpoint measurements. To extract higher value from the existing and future compound target-profiling data, we implemented an open-data web platform, named Drug Target Commons (DTC), which features tools for crowd-sourced compound-target bioactivity data annotation, standardization, curation, and intra-resource integration. We demonstrate the unique value of DTC with several examples related to both drug discovery and drug repurposing applications and invite researchers to join this community effort to increase the reuse and extension of compound bioactivity data.

Abstract: The DEAD box protein DDX5, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and is associated with solid tumors and leukemia. However, its role in oxLDL-induced lipid uptake in macrophages remains unclear. In this study, we detected the expression of DDX5 mRNA and protein in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-treated human primary macrophages that were induced from monocytes isolated from human peripheral blood with or without several chemical inhibitors using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) or Western blotting. We found that oxLDL induced DDX5 expression to be independent of both the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. We also found that DDX5 promoted macrophage lipid uptake by evaluating the fluorescence intensity of engulfed dil-oxLDL. Various scavenger receptors that participate in lipid uptake were detected in siR-DDX5 transfected macrophages using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Macrophage scavenger receptor A (MSR1) was found to be involved the upregulation of DDX5-mediated lipid uptake. Through the use of a dual luciferase reporter assay system and incubation with cycloheximide (CHX) MG132 and actidione (ActD), we found that DDX5 promoted MSR1 protein expression by stabilizing MSR1 mRNA. Moreover, the mechanism involved in DDX5 regulation of MSR1 mRNA was also explored using mass spectrum analysis; Immunoprecipitations (IPs) and RNA- Immunoprecipitations (R-IPs) revealed that mettl3 was involved in DDX5-mediated MSR1 mRNA stabilization. In addition, we also demonstrated that DDX5 inhibited mettl3 to catalyze m6a methylation in MSR1 mRNA, which contributed to the maintenance of MSR1 mRNA stability. In conclusion, ox-LDL promotes DDX5 expression in macrophages, which interacts with mettl3 to stabilize MSR1 mRNA by decreasing the m6a modification of MSR1 mRNA, ultimately promoting lipid uptake in macrophages.

Abstract: Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is the maternally inherited mitochondrial disease caused by homoplasmic mutations in mitochondrial electron transport chain Complex I subunit genes. The mechanism of its incomplete penetrance is still largely unclear. In this study, we created the patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from MT-ND4 mutated LHON-affected patient, asymptomatic mutation carrier and healthy control, and differentiated them into retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We found the defective neurite outgrowth in affected RGCs, but not in the carrier RGCs which had significant expression of SNCG gene. We observed enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in affected and carrier derived RGCs. Surprisingly, we observed increased NADH dehydrogenase enzymatic activity of Complex I in hiPSC-derived RGCs of asymptomatic carrier, but not of the affected patient. LHON mutation substantially decreased basal respiration in both affected and unaffected carrier hiPSCs, and had the same effect on spare respiratory capacity, which ensures normal function of mitochondria in conditions of increased energy demand or environmental stress. The expression of antioxidant enzyme catalase was decreased in affected and carrier patient hiPSC-derived RGCs as compared to the healthy control, which might indicate to higher oxidative stress-enriched environment in the LHON-specific RGCs. Microarray profiling demonstrated enhanced expression of cell cycle machinery and downregulation of neuronal specific genes.

Abstract: Summary
The cysteine prodrug N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is widely used as a pharmacological antioxidant and cytoprotectant. It has been reported to lower endogenous oxidant levels and to protect cells against a wide range of pro-oxidative insults. As NAC itself is a poor scavenger of oxidants, the molecular mechanisms behind the antioxidative effects of NAC have remained uncertain. Here we show that NAC-derived cysteine is desulfurated to generate hydrogen sulfide, which in turn is oxidized to sulfane sulfur species, predominantly within mitochondria. We provide evidence suggesting the possibility that sulfane sulfur species produced by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase are the actual mediators of the immediate antioxidative and cytoprotective effects provided by NAC.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal human malignant tumor because of the early onset of local invasion and distant metastasis. Perineural invasion is a prominent characteristic of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which is a multifactorial process that involves various signaling molecules from different signaling pathways. The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family of ligands was reported to be involved in perineural invasion in pancreatic cancer. Artemin is one member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family of ligands. Although Artemin has previously been demonstrated to promote invasiveness of pancreatic cancer, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed an analysis to determine the effects of Artemin on modulating tumor cell metastatic potential and invasion activity and explored its mechanisms in pancreatic cancer. We indicated that Artemin and CXCR4 were overexpressed in cancer tissues and widely expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines. We observed that activation of ERK1/2 and Akt in Artemin-treated cells led to enhanced nuclear accumulation of NF-κB, which then induced CXCR4 expression. Through regulation of the expression of CXCR4, Artemin functionally promoted the migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells. The present study indicated that Artemin induced CXCR4 expression by activating Akt and ERK 1/2/NF-κB signaling, thereby modulating tumor cell metastatic potential and invasion activity in pancreatic cancer by regulating SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis. Artemin might be an effective and potent therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer metastasis, especially in perineural invasion.

Abstract: Epiphyseal growth plate is highly dynamic tissue which is controlled by a variety of endocrine, paracrine hormones, and by complex local signaling loops and mechanical loading. Mechano growth factor (MGF), the splice variant of the IGF-I gene, has been discovered to play important roles in tissue growth and repair. However, the effect of MGF on the growth plate remains unclear. In the present study, we found that MGF mRNA expression of growth plate chondrocytes was upregulated in response to mechanical stimuli. Treatment of MGF had no effect on growth plate chondrocytes proliferation and differentiation. But it could inhibit growth plate chondrocytes apoptosis and inflammation under mechanical overload. Moreover, both wound healing and transwell assay indicated that MGF could significantly enhance growth plate chondrocytes migration which was accompanied with YAP activation and nucleus translocation. Knockdown of YAP with YAP siRNA suppressed migration induced by MGF, indicating the essential role of YAP in MGF promoting growth plate chondrocytes migration. Furthermore, MGF promoted YAP activation through RhoA GTPase mediated cytoskeleton reorganization, RhoA inhibition using C3 toxin abrogated MGF induced YAP activation. Importantly, we found that MGF promoted focal adhesion(FA) formation and knockdown of YAP with YAP siRNA partially suppressed the activation of FA kinase, implying that YAP is associated with FA formation. In conclusion, MGF is an autocrine growth factor which is regulated by mechanical stimuli. MGF could not only protect growth plate chondrocytes against damage by mechanical overload, but also promote migration through activation of RhoA/YAP signaling axis. Most importantly, our findings indicate that MGF promote cell migration through YAP mediated FA formation to determine the FA-cytoskeleton remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) have crucial functions, but their roles in obesity are not well defined. We show here that ASCs from obese individuals have defective primary cilia, which are shortened and unable to properly respond to stimuli. Impaired cilia compromise ASC functionalities. Exposure to obesity-related hypoxia and cytokines shortens cilia of lean ASCs. Like obese ASCs, lean ASCs treated with interleukin-6 are deficient in the Hedgehog pathway, and their differentiation capability is associated with increased ciliary disassembly genes like AURKA. Interestingly, inhibition of Aurora A or its downstream target the histone deacetylase 6 rescues the cilium length and function of obese ASCs. This work highlights a mechanism whereby defective cilia render ASCs dysfunctional, resulting in diseased adipose tissue. Impaired cilia in ASCs may be a key event in the pathogenesis of obesity, and its correction might provide an alternative strategy for combating obesity and its associated diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS recognizes viral DNA and synthesizes the second messenger cGAMP upon viral infection. cGAMP binds to the adaptor protein MITA/STING to activate downstream signaling events, leading to induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and antiviral effector genes. Here we identify the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein UL31 as an inhibitor of cGAS. UL31 interacts directly with cGAS and disassociates DNA from cGAS, thus inhibiting cGAS enzymatic functions and reducing cGAMP production. UL31 overexpression markedly reduces antiviral responses stimulated by cytosolic DNA, while knockdown or knockout of UL31 heightens HCMV-triggered induction of type I IFNs and downstream antiviral genes. Moreover, wild-type HCMV replicates more efficiently than UL31-deficient HCMV, a phenotype that is reversed in cGAS null cells. These results highlight the importance of cGAS in the host response to HCMV as well as an important viral strategy to evade this innate immune sensor.

Abstract: Choroideremia (CHM) is a rare monogenic, X-linked recessive inherited retinal degeneration resulting from mutations in the Rab Escort Protein-1 (REP1) encoding CHM gene. The primary retinal cell type leading to CHM is unknown. In this study, we explored the utility of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived models of retinal pigmented epithelium (iPSC-RPE) to study disease pathogenesis and a potential gene-based intervention in four different genetically distinct forms of CHM. A number of abnormal cell biologic, biochemical, and physiologic functions were identified in the CHM mutant cells. We then identified a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype, AAV7m8, that is optimal for both delivering transgenes to iPSC-RPEs as well as to appropriate target cells (RPE cells and rod photoreceptors) in the primate retina. To establish the proof of concept of AAV7m8 mediated CHM gene therapy, we developed AAV7m8.hCHM, which delivers the human CHM cDNA under control of CMV-enhanced chicken β-actin promoter (CßA). Delivery of AAV7m8.hCHM to CHM iPSC-RPEs restored protein prenylation, trafficking and phagocytosis. The results confirm that AAV-mediated delivery of the REP1-encoding gene can rescue defects in CHM iPSC-RPE regardless of the type of disease-causing mutation. The results also extend our understanding of mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of choroideremia.

Abstract: Activating mutations of RAS genes, particularly KRAS, are detected with high frequency in human tumors. Mutated Ras proteins constitutively activate the ERK pathway (Raf–MEK–ERK phosphorylation cascade), leading to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. DA-Raf1 (DA-Raf) is a splicing variant of A-Raf and contains the Ras-binding domain (RBD) but lacks the kinase domain. Accordingly, DA-Raf antagonizes the Ras–ERK pathway in a dominant-negative fashion and suppresses constitutively activated K-Ras-induced cellular transformation. Thus, we have addressed whether DA-Raf serves as a tumor suppressor of Ras-induced tumorigenesis. DA-Raf(R52Q), which is generated from a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the RBD, and DA-Raf(R52W), a mutant detected in a lung cancer, neither bound to active K-Ras nor interfered with the activation of the ERK pathway. They were incapable of suppressing activated K-Ras-induced cellular transformation and tumorigenesis in mice, in which K-Ras-transformed cells were transplanted. Furthermore, although DA-Raf was highly expressed in lung alveolar epithelial type 2 (AE2) cells, its expression was silenced in AE2-derived lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with oncogenic KRAS mutations. These results suggest that DA-Raf represents a tumor suppressor protein against Ras-induced tumorigenesis.
