Abstract: Summary
Flow-based hydrovoltaic nanogenerators have attracted particular attention as efficient and facile miniature energy-harvesting devices. However, they deliver relatively low output power density and limited power conversion efficiency owing to inefficient charge separation and poor charge accumulation. Here, we report the fabrication of high-performance, fiber-shaped fluidic nanogenerators (FFNGs) that use MoS2-encapsulated C fibers. The FFNGs deliver stable output voltages of 540 mV and an ultrahigh power density of 10.8 W m−2. With experiments and density functional theory calculations, improvements in output performance can be attributed to smaller energy requirements for Na+ cation adsorption, increased charge separation, and diffusion layer formations on the near surface. Moreover, self-powered, integrated devices achieve a maximum total power conversion-storage efficiency of ∼11% and stable output voltage up to 3.1 V, which is applicable for use in consumer electronics devices.

Abstract: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a lethal genetic disease characterised by progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles induced by deficiency of dystrophin, a cytoskeletal protein expressed in myocytes and in certain neuron populations. The severity of the neurological disorder varies in humans and animal models owing to dysfunction in numerous brain areas, including the hippocampus. Cyclic treatments with high-dose glucocorticoids remain a major pharmacological approach for treating the disease; however, elevated systemic levels of either stress-induced or exogenously administered anti-inflammatory molecules dramatically affect hippocampal activity. In this study, we analysed and compared the response of hippocampal neurons isolated from wild-type and dystrophic mdx mice to acute administration of corticosterone in vitro, without the influence of other glucocorticoid-regulated processes. Our results showed that in neurons of mdx mice, both the genomic and intracellular signalling-mediated responses to corticosterone were affected compared to those in wild-type animals, evoking the characteristic response to detrimental chronic glucocorticoid exposure. Responsiveness to glucocorticoids is, therefore, another function of hippocampal neurons possibly affected by deficiency of Dp427 since embryonic development. Knowing the pivotal role of hippocampus in stress hormone signalling, attention should be paid to the effects that prolonged glucocorticoid treatments may have on this and other brain areas of DMD patients.

Abstract: Summary
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting devices replace electrical contacts in a solid-state solar cell with a solid/liquid junction to improve the solar-to-H2conversion efficiency and reduce system cost. The wireless configuration can fully use the advantage of the PEC by removing all electrical contacts; however, the wired configuration with the electrical contact on its back side has been widely studied to facilitate device characterization. In this study, a wireless PEC water splitting device made of a commercially available III-V triple-junction solar cell protected by transparent TiO2 is demonstrated with high efficiency and stability. The wireless device produces both H2 and O2 products in a stoichiometric ratio in 13% of solar-to-H2 conversion efficiency over ∼12 h, and the total amount of H2 product during the lifetime of the device reaches 51 mL/cm2, which is the highest value reported from wireless PEC devices to the best of our knowledge.

Abstract: Summary
A promising technology for the future of solar energy is the highly efficient bifacial photovoltaic (PV) cell using perovskite as an absorbing layer. Here we report the environmental impact per energy generated from bifacial perovskite PV cells in single- and multi-junction configurations. To determine the environmental performance of the energy provided from bifacial perovskites and compare it with the analogous monofacial structures, we develop a realistic energy yield (EY) model. According to our model, the studied bifacial structures show between 9% and 26% EY increase compared with monofacial cells among all surfaces and locations studied. For the environmental impact analysis, we use normalized cradle-to-end-of-use impact from single-junction crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells as a reference point. Our results show that there are opportunities for all studied bifacial perovskite PV structures to become more environmentally friendly than c-Si cells.

Abstract: Summary
Development of efficient solar cells under indoor light has attracted tremendous attention because of the Internet of Things revolution. Here we investigate the effect of chlorine in perovskite precursors for indoor light applications. Use of chlorine has an effect on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells, especially under low-intensity indoor light. Based on the characterization of leakage current, crystalline structure, and Urbach tail, we reveal that chlorine doping of the perovskite layer influences the movement of photo-generated carriers and ions because of the smaller bulk defects in perovskite. In particular, we suggest that chlorine doping in perovskite facilitates hole extraction on its top surface and contributes to suppression of ion migration and non-radiative recombination, as confirmed by Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements. We demonstrate high performance of perovskite solar cells with a maximum power density of 35.25 (231.78) μW/cm2 under 400 lux light-emitting diode (halogen) illumination.

Abstract: Summary
Li-excess cation-disordered rocksalt (DRX) oxides have shown potential as high-energy-density Li-ion cathodes. They typically exploit O redox to achieve high capacity, which can trigger oxygen loss at the surface, thereby affecting the cathode performance. Here, we elucidate the impact that the surface structural evolution has on their electrochemical properties by comparing two prototypical DRX cathodes, Li1.2Ni0.333Ti0.333Mo0.133O2 (LNTMO) and Li1.2Mn0.6Nb0.2O2 (LMNO). Both cathodes achieve high capacity, but oxygen loss leads to significant polarization for LNTMO, whereas LMNO is far less affected. We show that while metal densification at the particle surface occurs for both materials, the resulting surface structure is strikingly different. A spinel phase forms at the surface of LMNO, which effectively alleviates oxygen loss and allows fast Li transport, whereas a densified DRX forms at the LNTMO surface, which impedes Li transport and cannot mitigate oxygen loss. These findings demonstrate the importance of the surface structure of DRX cathode.

Abstract: Summary
The prediction of the performance of battery cells is usually accomplished by computationally expensive numerical simulations. Here, we present a simple analytical model as an efficient alternative to predict the rate capability of battery cells limited by electrolyte transport without the need to fit parameters to simulations. It exhibits very good agreement with simulations over a wide range of discharge rate and electrode thickness and offers a speedup of >105 times. The optimal electrode properties predicted by the model differ <∼10% from simulation results, suggesting it as an attractive computational tool for the cell-level design of batteries. The model reveals that the discharge capacities of half- and full cells exhibit qualitatively different scaling relations with electrode thickness and current density, and the rate performance of thick electrodes can be improved by avoiding electrode materials (e.g., LiFePO4, Li4Ti5O12) whose open-circuit potentials are insensitive to the state of charge.

Abstract: Summary
Transition metal chalcogenides have received considerable attention in sodium-ion batteries. However, their practical application is greatly hindered by the low conductivity and sluggish kinetics. Here, we report a hierarchical structure, featuring carbon nanosheets grafted on carbon nanofibers, as a substrate that supports cobalt diselenide (CoSe2@ carbon nanosheets [CNS]/carbon nanofiber [CNF]) to boost the conductivity and prevent electrode pulverization. Moreover, we demonstrate that manganese doping can be used to expand the sodium-ion diffusion channels in Co1-xMnxSe2 and induce the synergistic lattice expansion of carbon nanosheets, alleviating the sluggish kinetics. Exploiting this strategy, the Co1-xMnxSe2@CNS/CNF with pre-sodium treatment can deliver a high specific energy density of 409.4 Wh kg−1 at 0.1 C when paired with Na2V1.85Fe0.15(PO4)3/C cathode in a full cell. This work may provide insights into how doping induces hierarchical lattice expansion of transition metal chalcogenide/carbon hybrids to alleviate sluggish kinetics and enhance sodium storage.

Abstract: Summary
Dissociation of organic molecules is one critical factor leading to degradation of perovskite solar cells. The much-improved thermal stability of formamidinium (FA) can significantly reduce molecular dissociation; however, FA-based perovskite suffers from high defect density, which affects efficiency and long-term stability. In this work, based on a precise ion-exchange reaction at the grain surface, we fabricate a Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3/CsxFA1-xPbI3 heterostructure with a Cs-rich CsxFA1-xPbI3 quasi-shell structure. The Cs-rich inorganic structure on the perovskite surface increases defect formation energy and reduces defect density, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 20.7%. The encapsulated device maintains 95% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 h of continuous operation, corresponding to a calculated lifetime approaching 2 years. The device can operate at 60°C for 250 h and at 85°C for over 3,000 min, which is one of the best operational stabilities for CsxFA1-xPbI3-based devices.

Abstract: Summary
Chemiluminescence and fluorescence have revolutionized the study of chemical and biological processes. However, unlike fluorescence, spatiotemporal control of chemiluminescence is challenging, and the technically simple solution of converting chemical energy into light energy only at specific sites defined by a clean, easy-to-deliver focused light stimulus is not yet a viable option. Here, we demonstrate the spatial and temporal control of a chemiluminescent reaction by photoinduced oxidative hotspots on a silicon surface. The excitation light is not required to pass through the liquid sample; hence, the light stimulus can excite a luminescent dye under effectively dark conditions. This provides a strategy for removing light-induced sample damages, photobleaching, and autofluorescence.

Abstract: Summary
Given that zero-dimensional molecular clusters do not easily form fixed porous and cavities in solutions, using them as probes for sensing metal ions, especially heavy metal ions, is replete with challenges. Here, we report two cage-shaped nanoclusters (Dy14 and Tb14), produced from o-vanillin, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine, and Ln(NO3)3⋅6H2O reacted at 80°C. The aforementioned fourteen nuclear cage-shaped nanoclusters comprise two oppositely twisted dish-shaped LnIII7 clusters connected by several strong hydrogen bonds. We speculate that the possible formation mechanism of the clusters is H2L1→DyL1→Dy2L1→Dy4(L1)2→Dy7(L1)3→Dy14(L1)6. Given that the high oxygen content in the cavity promotes host-guest interactions, the selective photoresponse of Dy14 and Tb14 as probes for various heavy metal ions are tested. Dy14 shows selective luminescence response to Cd(II) ions, while Tb14, where only the metal center is changed, selectively responds to Ag(I) ions.

Abstract: Summary
The dissolution of Ir-oxide-based catalysts remains a roadblock in the development of durable electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. Both the activity and stability of Ir-based catalysts are critically dependent on the ratio of stable rutile IrO2 and unstable amorphous Ir oxide (a-IrOx), as well as the spatial relationship between them. Here, we report that the domain size in hollow ternary Ir alloy nanocages can be fine-tuned by the introduction of dopant elements during the growth of parent core-shell nanoparticles, Cu@CuIr. After electrochemical oxidation under OER conditions, Ir alloy nanocages possessing multiple crystallites in their structure are transformed into hollow aggregates of loosely knit crystalline IrO2@a-IrOx domains, whereas single-crystalline Ir alloy nanocages are transformed to hollow Ir oxides with a random mixture of a-IrOx and IrO2. The loosely knit IrO2@a-IrOx structure achieves high OER activity and long-term stability, which is not feasible with the random mixture of a-IrOx and IrO2.

Abstract: Summary
Expanding decarbonization efforts beyond the power sector are contingent on cost-effective production of energy carriers, like H2, with near-zero life-cycle carbon emissions. Here, we assess the levelized cost of continuous H2 supply (95% availability) at industrial-scale quantities (∼100 tonnes/day) in 2030 from integrating commodity technologies for solar photovoltaics, electrolysis, and energy storage. Our approach relies on modeling the least-cost plant design and operation that optimize component sizes while adhering to hourly solar availability, production requirements, and component inter-temporal operating constraints. We apply the model to study H2 production costs spanning the continental United States and, through extensive sensitivity analysis, explore system configurations that can achieve $2.5/kg levelized costs or less for a range of plausible 2030 technology projections at high-irradiance locations. Notably, we identify potential sites and system configurations where PV-electrolytic H2 could substitute natural gas-derived H2 at avoided CO2 costs (≤$120/ton), similar to the cost of deploying carbon capture and sequestration.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular protein filaments are ubiquitous for cellular functions, but forming bona fide biomimetic intracellular filaments of small molecules in living cells remains elusive. Here, we report the in situ formation of self-limiting intracellular filaments of a small peptide via enzymatic morphological transition of a phosphorylated and trimethylated heterochiral tetrapeptide. Enzymatic dephosphorylation reduces repulsive intermolecular electrostatic interactions and converts the peptidic nanoparticles into filaments, which exhibit distinct types of cross-β structures with either C7 or C2 symmetries, with the hydrophilic C-terminal residues at the periphery of the helix. Macromolecular crowding promotes the peptide filaments to form bundles, which extend from the plasma membrane to nuclear membrane and hardly interact with endogenous components, including cytoskeletons. Stereochemistry and post-translational modification (PTM) of peptides are critical for generating the intracellular bundles. This work may offer a way to gain lost functions or to provide molecular insights for understanding normal and aberrant intracellular filaments.

Abstract: Summary
Flexible electronics have been rapidly developed in recent years. However, there are still some concerns about the degradation and short life caused by mechanical damage during their operation. Here, we present a self-healing electret nanogenerator (SENG) that can restore its structure and function after mechanical damage, benefiting from a healable polymer with reversible imine bond and the instantaneous healing ability of liquid metal. After destructive testing comprising four cutting-healing cycles the output current of the SENG autonomously recovers to the original values before damage. Finally, as a practical device, the SENG is demonstrated to work in both energy harvesting and human physiology-monitoring applications. This research offers a feasible route for improving reliability and lifetime of electret generators or other flexible electronics that suffer from mechanical damage.

Abstract: Summary
Advanced porous hybrid materials possessing synergistic properties have been widely explored for different applications. In this work, we report a facile strategy for the fabrication of a sandwiched heterogeneous catalytic platform (Pd/UiO-66-NH2@COF) by taking advantage of unique properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs). The platform is constructed using catalytically active palladium nanoparticles supported by a UiO-66-NH2 MOF core, followed by the coverage of COFs as the outer shell. The resultant Pd/UiO-66-NH2@COF exhibits excellent catalytic activity and substrate-size-selective performance for the hydrogenation of olefins. This investigation sheds light on the construction of sandwich-structured nanocomposites for addressing challenging size-selective catalytic processes.

Abstract: Summary
Fluorescent probes are important tools in cellular imaging. However, many readily available small-molecule imaging probes are either cytotoxic or easily photobleached and thus not compatible with lengthy live cell or tissue-imaging experiments. One particularly limited field of application is neuroscience, in which small-molecule probes for live cell imaging at the brain tissue level are highly scarce. Here, we describe a rapid synthetic route to generate a series of nuclear stains that enable experiments with live brain cells (i.e., water solubility, cell permeability, high quantum yield, high photostability, and most important, negligible cytotoxicity). As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that these probes are compatible with ex vivo and in vivo nuclear labeling experiments, including retrograde transport to monitor and map certain brain regions of the mouse model. The structural versatility and superior non-cytotoxic properties of these probes may suggest their potential use in labeling and tracing of neuronal populations.

Abstract: Summary
Gel formation using guanosine self-assembly is an important process in supramolecular chemistry. Here, we report the stepwise construction of circularly polarized luminescent supramolecular organogels from self-assembled guanosine quadruplexes. A lipophilic guanosine derivative (aldG) is designed and synthesized for the formation of a well-defined G8-octamer. The diamine linkers are used to connect G8-octamer units by imine formation to facilitate the construction of the supramolecular gel networks. 1H NMR experiments show that the pre-assembled aldG8-octamer remains intact and is crucial for transparent and stiff organogel formation. With extended conjugation, the aldG organogels exhibit strong green fluorescence emission and circularly polarized properties without the assistance of any external fluorescent dyes, suggesting an alternative approach to construct molecular probes for biological and material applications.

Abstract: Summary
Bridged and fused polycyclic structures are found in a huge number of natural products. Significant progress has been made on their syntheses; however, facile and practical strategies to afford polycycles with tunable substituents and functional groups remain rare. Here, we report a practical rhodium(III)-catalyzed asymmetric borylative cyclization of cyclohexadienone-containing 1,6-enynes, affording highly enantioenriched cis-bicyclic frameworks with great functional group compatibility, and further extend it to construct bridged tricyclic and fused tetracyclic skeletons in one-pot protocols. The combination of borylative cyclization with a subsequent oxidation/aldol reaction sequence goes through an epimerization of the stereocenter adjacent to the acetyl group, yielding various tricyclic compounds. In addition, borylative cyclization is combined with a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling/Michael addition sequence, leading to diverse tetracyclic compounds. Starting from simple starting materials, both one-pot transformations yield complex products bearing several consecutive stereocenters with excellent enantioselectivities. Furthermore, an unnatural steroid-like compound is also readily prepared, demonstrating the potential of this methodology.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon materials are widely used in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high performance, safety, and reliability, along with low cost and easy availability. However, the low lithium storage capability of bare carbon materials limits the further improvement of the capacity of LIBs. Here, we report a facile self-poring strategy for the synthesis of trace amounts of ZnO quantum dots (QDs) (∼5 nm) embedded in highly porous carbon nanosheets by using the metal centers of a Zn-based metal-organic ligand structure as a pore-creating agent. Benefiting from the synergistic functions of nanostructuring, heterocomponent doping, and QDs effects, the as-prepared materials deliver superior lithium storage properties in comparison with the existing carbon-based materials—2,300 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, ∼600 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1, and ∼700 mAh g−1 after 3,000 cycles at 5 A g−1—and are promising candidates for next-generation high-capacity LIB electrodes.

Abstract: Summary
Interfacial deposition stability between lithium metal and a solid electrolyte (SE) is important in preventing interfacial contact loss, mechanical fracture, and dendrite growth in Li-metal solid-state batteries (SSBs). In this work, we investigate the deposition and mechanical stability at the Li-metal/SE interface and its consequences (such as SE fracture and contact loss). A wide range of contributing factors are investigated, such as charge and mass transfer kinetics, plasticity of Li-metal and fracture of the SE, and the applied stack pressure. We quantify the effect of the ionic conductivity of the SE, the exchange current density of the interfacial charge-transfer reaction, and SE surface roughness on the Li deposition stability at the Li-metal/SE interface. We also propose a “mechanical stability window” for the applied stack pressure that can prevent both contact loss and SE fracture, which can be extended to other metal-electrode (e.g., sodium) SSB systems.

Abstract: Summary
Thioacetal/thioketal moieties have been identified as responsive to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Despite its utility in a broad range of applications, the mechanism that underlies the ROS-induced cleavage of these moieties is not well understood. In this work, through a series of structure-property relationship studies such as Hammett correlation, we propose a mechanism or the oxidative cleavage of thioacetals and thioketals, where the thiolate components are converted to the corresponding disulfide product along with the formation of the respective aldehydes and ketones. The mechanism proposed here involves thioether oxidation that leads to the formation of a thionium intermediate, hydrolysis of which leads to the aldehyde/ketone product. In addition, we also show a preliminary demonstration of the utility of such an understanding, as it offers to sequentially release two distinct small molecules caged in a substrate using two contradictory stimuli, viz. oxidative and reductive conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Scalable production of two-dimensional (2D) materials is pivotal to their widespread engineering applications. However, unlike for graphene, h-BN, and MoS2, we still lack a scalable production method for 2D metals, which are newcomers to the family of 2D materials but have shown great potential for various important applications. Here, we develop a low-cost, high-yield scalable production method for 2D metals through polymer surface buckling enabled exfoliation (PSBEE). Compared to the traditional synthesis methods for 2D metals, PSBEE is desirable in terms of its high yield (30%–100%), superior production rate (101–103 mg/h), and low energy consumption rate (107–109 J/g). Most important, PSBEE enables the fabrication of freestanding 2D metallic nanosheets with a thermodynamically stable or metastable atomic structure, a large in-plane size, and unrestricted chemical makeup (from elemental metals to chemically complex alloys), which is incredibly rare in the field of 2D materials.

Abstract: Summary
Radiative particles are ubiquitous in nature and in various technologies. Calculating radiative properties from known geometry and designs can be computationally expensive, and trying to invert the problem to come up with designs specific to desired radiative properties is even more challenging. Here, we report a machine-learning (ML)-based method for both the forward and inverse problem for dielectric and metallic particles. Our decision-tree-based model is able to provide explicit design rules for inverse problems. Furthermore, we can use the same trained model for both the forward and the inverse problem, which greatly simplifies the computation. Our methodology shows the promise of augmenting optical design optimizations by providing interpretable and actionable design rules for rapidly finding approximate solutions for the inverse design problem.

Abstract: Summary
Diffusion-controlled charge storage and phase transitions of electrodes are typical indicators of sluggish kinetics in battery chemistries. However, fast rate capabilities are found in an α-MoO3 proton intercalation electrode that presents both features. Here, the unique topochemistry is shown to involve multiple ion-electrode interactions and proceeds via two key steps: hydronium adsorption on surfaces and proton insertion into bulk lattices. This triggers structure transitions from MoO3 to hydrogen molybdenum bronzes (HMBs). Following the first process, subsequent rearrangements proceed only among HMBs phases with high reversibility and kinetics, thus providing structural explanations to the fast rate capability. At electrode-electrolyte interfaces, hydronium is the active charge carrier that initiates charge transfer and surface hydration, which are accompanied by water adsorption/desorption with reduced polarization and enhanced kinetics. Further water activity is shown to induce material dissolution during function. These findings offer fundamental insights in proton chemistries, which may form the basis of future high rate and capacity energy storage.

Abstract: Summary
Optimizing reaction conditions depends on expert chemistry knowledge and laborious exploration of reaction parameters. To automate this task and augment chemical intuition, we here report a computational tool to navigate search spaces. Our approach (LabMate.ML) integrates random sampling of 0.03%–0.04% of all search space as input data with an interpretable, adaptive machine-learning algorithm. LabMate.ML can optimize many real-valued and categorical reaction parameters simultaneously, with minimal computational resources and time. In nine prospective proof-of-concept studies pursuing distinctive objectives, we demonstrate how LabMate.ML can identify optimal goal-oriented conditions for several different chemistries and substrates. Double-blind competitions and the conducted expert surveys reveal that its performance is competitive with that of human experts. LabMate.ML does not require specialized hardware, affords quantitative and interpretable reactivity insights, and autonomously formalizes chemical intuition, thereby providing an innovative framework for informed, automated experiment selection toward the democratization of synthetic chemistry.

Abstract: Summary
Integrated carbon capture and utilization (CCU) is appealing for in situ production of fuels and chemicals. Here, we propose and subsequently assess an integrated electrochemical CCU process and compare it with a carbon capture and storage (CCS) route from economic and environmental perspectives. This analysis reveals that under a baseline CCU scenario, carbon products reap either economic (67% and 10% gross margin increase for carbon monoxide [CO] and n-propanol, respectively) or environmental benefits (formic acid production would reduce ∼721 thousand ton carbon dioxide equivalent [CO2e]/year) relative to the CCS route. Under an optimistic scenario, while all of the carbon dioxide (CO2)-derived products are economically compelling over the CCS route, only formic acid production would reduce ∼1,465 thousand ton CO2e/year over CCS (∼575 thousand ton CO2e/year). This study may serve as a framework to decide whether a CCS or a CCU pathway would be compelling under a given scenario when fuel-cell-based CO2 capture technology is used to reduce carbon emissions and create economic value from fossil fuel-based power plants.

Abstract: Kinesin Family Member 23 (KIF23), a cell cycle regulator, has a key task in cytokinesis. KIF23 over-expression in cancer has been associated with tumor growth, progression, and poor prognosis, indicating a potential to be a cancer biomarker. A mutation in KIF23 (c.2747C > G, p.P916R) was shown to cause congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, type III (CDA III). To-date, fifteen KIF23 transcripts have been annotated, but their expression is poorly investigated. We hypothesized that tissue specific expression of a particular transcript can be critical for CDA III phenotype. In this study, we quantified expression of alternative Kif23 transcripts in a mouse model with human KIF23 mutation and investigated its association with a regulator of alternative splicing, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (Srsf3). We confirmed presence of an additional exon 8 in both human and mouse KIF23 transcripts. A transcript lacking exons 17 and 18 was ubiquitously expressed in mice while other isoforms were common in human tissues however in bone marrow of knock-in mice a transcript without exon 18 was prevalent as it was in bone marrow of a CDA III patient. We conclude that the possibility that the tissue specific expression of KIF23 alternative transcripts influence the CDA III phenotype cannot be neglected.

Abstract: Summary
Infectious endophthalmitis is a growing concern that causes irreversible intraocular tissue and optic nerve damage. Here, we report a theranostic nanoplatform based on UiO-66-NH2 to combine photodynamic therapy (PDT) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) targeting through polypeptide (YVLWKRKRKFCFI-NH2) modification. Toluidine blue (TB), serving as a photosensitizer (PS), is loaded into UiO-66-NH2 nanoparticles (NPs) for both self-imaging and PDT functions. The accelerated TB release at pH 5.5 compared to pH 7.4 demonstrates the responsive drug release feature. In vitro antibacterial tests, including contact incubation-agar plate counting, bacterial live/dead staining, and scanning electron microscopy observations, confirm the utility of the TB@UiO-66-NH2@PEP&PEG NPs (UTPP NPs) in biofilms removal and sterilization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Furthermore, the UTPP NPs also show good biocompatibility toward human retinal pigment epithelial cells, as well as in situ self-imaging property. Finally, an in vivo infectious endophthalmitis model supports the application of the UTPP NPs in infectious endophthalmitis treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Solar and thermal management of transparent windows is important for the energy efficiency of human-made structures. Functional layers that partially block solar radiation would also be heated by sunlight, thus accelerating the interior heat exchange and increasing daytime cooling energy consumption. Here, we propose a strategy to improve energy efficiency through window cooling using a transparent double-layer coating, which comprises a near-infrared reflective underlayer and a high mid-infrared emissive top layer. The addition of a top emitter can decrease the temperature of the near-infrared reflective window up to ∼7°C in outdoor tests, and can provide extra cooling energy savings ranging from 20 to 49 MJ ⋅ m−2 ⋅ year−1 for a typical building located in 11 cities worldwide. This accounts for ∼3%–∼8% of their total annual cooling energy consumption and indicates the significant impact of window cooling on interior energy efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatographic-based approaches are most widely used for the analysis of enantiomers. Unambiguous results are achieved through the visualization of each enantiomer, while the separation process is often time consuming. By endowing 19F probes with suitable dynamic recognition properties, we develop here a detection scheme that produces chromatogram-like output in the analysis of enantiomeric mixtures without separation. A wide range of chiral compounds, including alcohols, ethers, amides, carbamates, oxazolidinones, sulfoxides, and sulfoximines, are successfully resolved, and the simultaneous enantiodifferentiation of different classes of chiral compounds is achieved. The method is also amenable for the determination of the enantiopurity of crude reaction products and the assignment of absolute configurations. The potential utility in high-throughput screening is demonstrated by the analysis of 24 nonracemic samples in 30 min with an NMR spectrometer equipped with an autosampler.

Abstract: Summary
The implementation of electrolysis systems for electrochemical hydrogen production has continued to grow as the paradigm shift toward renewable energy and fuels progresses. However, issues regarding conventional polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers remain; their performance can be affected when operated with intermittent energy sources due to gas crossover, while the high cost of electricity continues to hinder large-scale adoption of the technology. To make electrochemical hydrogen production more competitive, renewable energy sources need to be used with new strategies for electrochemical hydrogen production. Here, we show a cerium-mediated decoupled electrolysis system that produces hydrogen and stores energy in the redox couples. We present electrochemical studies to observe the effects of diffusive transport, convective transport, and thermal effects. Following this, a technoeconomic analysis is done, focusing on the optimization of the system operation and the identification of target operation parameters to achieve hydrogen production at a competitive price.

Abstract: Summary
Transparent windows that insulate against infrared light and heat entering buildings hold the promise of reducing energy consumption. However, a long-standing challenge for energy-saving window materials is to concurrently achieve a large tuning of refractive index, broad transmission modulation, and near-room-temperature phase transition. Here, we report the insulation of heat and infrared radiation by using a functionally graded transparent nanocomposite consisting of a hollow network-nanoparticle hybrid. We demonstrate ΔT of 6.9°C by combining the light-reflectance properties of metallic nanoparticles and the thermal insulation of hollow shell networks, resulting in an equivalent cooling power of 396 W/m2 under a light intensity of 3 W/cm2. This flexible nanocomposite sheet shows a high transparency of 91.0%, low haze in the visible region, and a modulus of 160 MPa. The gradient nanocomposites combine UV light blocking, visible transparency, and infrared light shielding, potentially opening a new avenue for energy-saving building window applications.

Abstract: Summary
The climate challenge calls for the design of energy-efficient CO2-separation materials. CO2-selective solid physisorbents are characterized by a low energy penalty and enable the most promising and energy-efficient CO2 separation technologies by applying vacuum swing adsorption (VSA). Here, we show that a diammonium-pillared microporous organically pillared layered silicate 7 (MOPS-7) represents a CO2-selective physisorbent, synthesized by simple ion exchange of an inexpensive clay. This MOPS provides high dynamic, reversible, and reproducible CO2 uptakes and selectivities proven in dynamic breakthrough experiments mimicking flue gas, natural gas, and biogas conditions. The selective interaction with CO2 is dominated by the multipole interactions with the microporous hybrid material. Thus, the energy penalty attributed to regeneration is intrinsically reduced. The simplicity and modularity of pillaring low-budget and environmentally friendly clays, combined with industrially capable performance with respect to thermal stability, high dynamic CO2 adsorption selectivity, and energy-efficient restoration renders MOPS-7 a highly attractive CO2 adsorbent.

Abstract: Enhanced odontoblast differentiation of human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) is considered a keystone in dentin-pulp complex formation. We have revealed lncRNA DANCR was implicated in this differentiation program, however, its mechanism in odontoblast differentiation of hDPCs remains further explored. In this study, by employing loss-of-function approach, we identified downregulation of DANCR drived odontoblast differentiaion of hDPCs. Bioinformatics analysis was utilized to show that DANCR contained binding site for miR-216a and an inverse correlation between DANCR and miR-216a was obtained. Dual luciferase reporter assay and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) were applied to further confirm that DANCR conferred its functions by directly binding to miR-216a. Notably, miR-216a was able to bind to the 3′-UTR of c-Cbl and repressed its expression. In addition, the protein level of c-CBL was significantly downregulated during hDPCs differentiation, while c-Cbl overexpression inhibited odontoblast differentiation of hDPCs. Moreover, downregulation of miR-216a efficiently reversed the suppression of c-Cbl level and odontoblast differentiation induced by knockdown of DANCR. Taken together, these analyses indicated that DANCR positively regulated the expression of c-Cbl, through sponging miR-216a, and inhibited odontoblast differentiation of hDPCs. Our results will extend the field of clinical application for cell-based therapy in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: The scaffold protein Tks5α is required for invadopodia-mediated cancer invasion both in vitro and in vivo. We have previously also revealed a role for Tks5 in tumor cell growth using three-dimensional (3D) culture model systems and mouse transplantation experiments. Here we use both 3D and high-density fibrillar collagen (HDFC) culture to demonstrate that native collagen-I, but not a form lacking the telopeptides, stimulated Tks5-dependent growth, which was dependent on the DDR collagen receptors. We used microenvironmental microarray (MEMA) technology to determine that laminin, fibronectin and tropoelastin also stimulated invadopodia formation. A Tks5α-specific monoclonal antibody revealed its expression both on microtubules and at invadopodia. High- and super-resolution microscopy of cells in and on collagen was then used to place Tks5α at the base of invadopodia, separated from much of the actin and cortactin, but coincident with both matrix metalloprotease and cathepsin proteolytic activity. Inhibition of the Src family kinases, cathepsins or metalloproteases all reduced invadopodia length but each had distinct effects on Tks5α localization. These studies highlight the crosstalk between invadopodia and extracellular matrix components, and reveal the invadopodium to be a spatially complex structure.

Abstract: Background
Post-transplant maintenance provides progression-free survival benefit in multiple myeloma (MM). Here we report our institution's experience with elotuzumab-based maintenance following autologous stem cell transplant.
Methods
We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of MM patients who were started on elotuzumab-based maintenance (elotuzumab/lenalidomide/dexamethasone, elotuzumab/bortezomib/dexamethasone, or elotuzumab/bortezomib/methylprednisolone) following transplant (N = 7). Baseline characteristics, treatment response, survival, and adverse events were reviewed.
Results
Median age was 68 (56–81) years at the time of transplant, and median lines of induction therapy was 2 (1–6). Three patients (42.9%) had high-risk cytogenetics and five (71.4%) had stage II or greater disease at diagnosis. At a median follow-up of 24 months (12–50), five patients (71.4%) had improvement of quality of response, with a combined CR or VGPR rate increasing from 57.1% to 100% (CR = 3, VGPR = 4). All patients were alive without relapse or progression at the time of this analysis. Grade 3–4 adverse events were observed in three (42.9%) patients. None of the patients discontinued the treatment due to intolerance.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates that elotuzumab-based maintenance may deepen response post-transplant in MM and can be safely administered even in older patients. Given its unique action and rare side effects, further studies of elotuzumab in the post-transplant setting are warranted.

Abstract: Summary
Since mitochondria contribute to tumorigenesis and drug resistance in cancer, mitochondrial genetic engineering promises a new direction for cancer therapy. Here, we report the use of the perimitochondrial enzymatic noncovalent synthesis (ENS) of peptides for delivering genes selectively into the mitochondria of cancer cells for mitochondrial genetic engineering. Specifically, the micelles of peptides bind to the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) on mitochondria for the proteolysis by enterokinase (ENTK), generating perimitochondrial nanofibers in cancer cells. This process, facilitating selective delivery of nucleic acid or gene vectors into mitochondria of cancer cells, enables the mitochondrial transgene expression of CRISPR/Cas9, FUNDC1, p53, and fluorescent proteins. Mechanistic investigation indicates that the interaction of the peptide assemblies with the VDAC and mitochondrial membrane potential are necessary for mitochondria targeting. This local enzymatic control of intermolecular noncovalent interactions enables selective mitochondrial genetic engineering, thus providing a strategy for targeting cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proposed as biocompatible candidates for the targeted intracellular delivery of chemotherapeutic payloads, but the site of drug loading and subsequent effect on intracellular release is often overlooked. Here, we analyze doxorubicin delivery to cancer cells by MIL-101(Cr) and UiO-66 in real time. Having experimentally and computationally verified that doxorubicin is pore loaded in MIL-101(Cr) and surface loaded on UiO-66, different time-dependent cytotoxicity profiles are observed by real-time cell analysis and confocal microscopy. The attenuated release of aggregated doxorubicin from the surface of Dox@UiO-66 results in a 12 to 16 h induction of cytotoxicity, while rapid release of pore-dispersed doxorubicin from Dox@MIL-101(Cr) leads to significantly higher intranuclear localization and rapid cell death. In verifying real-time cell analysis as a versatile tool to assess biocompatibility and drug delivery, we show that the localization of drugs in (or on) MOF nanoparticles controls delivery profiles and is key to understanding in vitro modes of action.

Abstract: Summary
Single-molecule surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a sensitive technique for detecting low concentrations of adsorbed analytes on plasmonic nanosurfaces. Here, we observe that scavenging dissolved oxygen can further increase its sensitivity 109–1010 times, enabling real single-molecule detection—in other words, detecting 1 molecule in 300–500 μL aqueous solution. Experimental evidence and computational modeling support propagation of the plasmonic field throughout the entire sample volume, which enables analyte detection outside the instrument field of view. The application of readily available and inexpensive oxygen scavengers enables ultra-high analytical sensitivity using affordable instrumentation, greatly facilitating single-molecule-level research in both well-equipped and resource-limited laboratories. Furthermore, the discovery may bring fresh insights into the fundamental understanding of SERS and plasmonic field transmission in aqueous solutions.

Abstract: Summary
Lifetimes of chemical species are typically estimated by either fitting time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) histograms or phasor analysis from time-resolved photon arrivals. While both methods yield lifetimes in a computationally efficient manner, their performance is limited by choices made on the number of distinct chemical species contributing photons. However, the number of species is encoded in the photon arrival times collected for each illuminated spot and need not be set by hand a priori. Here, we propose a direct photon-by-photon analysis of data drawn from pulsed excitation experiments to infer, simultaneously and self-consistently, the number of species and their associated lifetimes from a few thousand photons. We do so by leveraging new mathematical tools within the Bayesian nonparametric. We benchmark our method for both simulated and experimental data for 1–4 species.

Abstract: Summary
Solar pyrolysis of renewable biomass has huge potential for sustainable production of fuel or chemical feedstock for the activated carbon materials. Here, we report a method for producing high-quality carbon nanofiber (CNF) precursor and subsequently CNFs as a low-cost and eco-friendly energy storage material. Specifically, pinewood is pyrolyzed with solar energy to generate a phenol-rich bioliquid precursor that is found to be a strong candidate for synthesizing binder-free flexible electrode materials via electrospinning. The CNFs prepared with 30% solar-driven bioliquids and 70% polyacrylonitrile have a high specific surface area and rich microstructure, which are the key to its electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance (349 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1) with notable rate performance, reversibility, and cycling stability in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Thus, solar bioliquids are feasible CNF precursors, and such derived CNFs have potential to be applied in energy storage devices.

Abstract: Summary
Radiative cooling is a passive cooling technology that acts by reflecting sunlight and emitting radiation in the sky window. Although highly desirable, full daytime sub-ambient radiative cooling in commercial-like single-layer particle-matrix paints has not been achieved. Here, we demonstrate full daytime sub-ambient radiative cooling in CaCO3-acrylic paint by using large band gap CaCO3 fillers, a high particle concentration of 60%, and a broad size distribution. Our paint shows a high solar reflectance of 95.5% and a high normal emissivity of 0.94 in the sky window. Field tests show cooling power exceeding 37 W/m2 and a surface temperature of >1.7°C below ambient at noon. A figure of merit RC is proposed to compare the cooling performance independent of weather conditions. The standard RC of our paint is 0.49, among the best radiative cooling performances, while offering the benefits of convenient paint form, low cost, and compatibility with commercial paint fabrication processes.

Abstract: Summary
A continuous supply of renewable energy requires intermittent sources to be paired with storage. Thermal storage is an excellent match for solar energy, but concentrating solar power plants must use high optical concentrations and large plants to be cost competitive. Here, we propose an alternative, solid-state heat engine for solar-thermal conversion consisting of a solar absorber, a thermoradiative cell, and a photovoltaic cell. Heat from the solar absorber or thermal storage drives radiative recombination current in the thermoradiative cell, and its emitted light is used by the photovoltaic cell. Based on the principle of detailed balance, we calculate a limiting solar conversion efficiency of 85% for fully concentrated sunlight and 45% for one sun with an absorber and single-junction cells of equal areas. Solar thermoradiative-photovoltaic systems outperform similar solar thermophotovoltaic converters for low band gaps and practical absorber temperatures, and for a realistic device, this improvement can be up to 7.9% (absolute).

Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, special attention has been addressed in cancer care to mitigate the impact on the patient’s prognosis. We addressed our preparation to face COVID-19 pandemic in a Hematological and Stem Cell Transplant Unit in Brazil during the first two months of COVID-19 pandemic and described COVID-19 cases in patients and health care workers (HCW). Modifications in daily routines included a separation of area and professionals, SARS-CoV-2 screening protocols, and others. A total of 47 patients and 54 HCW were tested for COVID-19, by PCR-SARS-CoV-2. We report 11 cases of COVID-19 in hematological patients (including 2 post stem cell transplant) and 28 cases in HCW. Hematological cases were most severe or moderate and presented with several poor risk factors. Among HCW, COVID-19 were mostly mild, and all recovered without hospitalization. A cluster was observed among HCW. Despite a decrease in the number of procedures, the Transplant Program performed 8 autologous and 4 allogeneic SCT during the period, and 49 onco-hematological patients were admitted to continuing their treatments. Although we observed a high frequency of COVID-19 among patients and HCW, showing that SARS-CoV-2 is disseminated in Brazil, hematological patients were safely treated during pandemic times.

Abstract: Summary
III–V/Si epitaxial tandems with a 1.7-eV GaAsP top cell promise stable power conversion efficiencies above the fundamental limit of Si single-junction cells. However, III–V/Si epitaxial tandems have suffered from limited minority carrier diffusion length in the top cell, leading to reduced short-circuit current densities (JSC) and efficiencies. While conventional wisdom dictates that dislocation density in III–V/Si tandems must be reduced to boost efficiency, here, we show that heterointerface design and growth sequence also play critical roles in reducing recombination losses. Our improved GaAsP cells make use of a wide-band gap AlGaAsP electron-blocking layer that forms a pristine interface with GaAsP, resulting in a 10%–20% (absolute) boost in quantum efficiency over previous work in the critical red wavelength range (600–725 nm), despite similar dislocation density. Combining the improved top cell carrier collection with Si backside texturing, we obtain 25.0% efficient GaAsP/Si tandem cells with a closely matched JSC of 18.8 mA/cm2.

Abstract: Summary
Inhomogeneous lithium deposition or dendrite formation and occurrence of “dead lithium” fractions are challenging issues, hampering the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. Conditions and strategies for minimizing potential failure of lithium metal anodes are currently not fully understood, despite recent progress. We report a protocol utilizing in situ and ex situ 7Li solid-state NMR spectroscopy to quantify irreversible lithium losses in batteries, clearly distinguishing losses due to SEI formation and fractions of “dead lithium,” revealing a distribution of different lithium metal microstructures on both working and counter electrodes upon plating and stripping. Estimates of dead lithium fractions of 3.3% ± 0.6% (with 5% FEC) and 9.4% ± 0.6% (without 5% FEC) are determined. The proposed protocol affords benchmarking of commercial cells, including future design of suitable strategies for effective development and tailoring of electrolyte formulations, fostering further advancement of high-performance energy storage applications.

Abstract: Summary
Water-in-salt electrolyte (WISE) systems have been recently identified to significantly enhance the performance of aqueous Li-ion batteries owing to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) due to localization of the cation-anion pair near the negative electrode in the absence of free water. Such localization occurs for an extremely large concentration of the electrolyte salt that enhances the interionic attraction between the salt cation and anion, thereby ensuring that the cation “carries” the anion with itself to the anode. Here, we use atomistic simulations to establish that for a LiTFSI electrolyte solution (LiTFSI is a salt that is widely known to form WISE systems) confined in a 1-nm-diameter boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), such water-free TFSI− anion localization at the anode surface is possible at a LiTFSI concentration that is several times smaller than that needed for such localization in a non-nanoconfined LiTFSI WISE system.

Abstract: Summary
Inhomogeneous microscopic carrier transport is difficult to study, but important in many condensed-matter applications. For example, the role of grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline semiconductors has been controversial for 20 years. In cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells, electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) measurements consistently demonstrate enhanced current collection along GBs, which is argued as evidence for interpenetrating CdTe p-n current-collection networks critical to high efficiency. Conversely, cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements consistently indicate that GBs are deleterious low-lifetime regions. Here, we apply transport imaging (TI) in conjunction with spatially correlated EBIC, CL, and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements to understand carrier drift, diffusion, and recombination in polycrystalline CdTe. We simultaneously observe GB potential wells, reduced carrier lifetime at GBs, and seemingly contradictory enhanced GB current collection, and then describe their coexistence with microscopic TI and physical arguments. The results provide visualization of inhomogeneous transport that is critical to understanding and engineering polycrystalline solar technology.

Abstract: Summary
Solar-driven electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen is emerging as a viable strategy to decarbonize the global energy economy. However, this direction is more expensive than traditional fossil fuel generation of hydrogen, and effective pathways to lower this cost need to be identified. Here, we report a Monte Carlo approach to explore a wide range of input assumptions to identify key cost drivers, targets, and localized conditions necessary for competitive stand-alone dedicated PV powered hydrogen electrolysis. We determine the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), considering historical weather data for specific locations to model our PV system, and optimize its size compared to the electrolyzer. This analysis and its methods show the potential for green hydrogen production using off-grid PV, shows the merits of remote systems in areas of high solar resource, and provides cost and performance targets for electrolyzer technologies.

Abstract: Summary
Directional design of chemical reaction, a prerequisite for efficient synthetic planning, has been challenged by the slow trial and error process in the laboratory and the high computational expense of ab initio calculations. It is desirable to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm to predict chemical reactions. Here, we propose an Unsupervised Assisted Directional Design of Chemical Reactions (UADDCR) software to determine whether a chemical reaction can proceed smoothly under given chemical equations, surface compositions, and facets, based on the unsupervised assisted neural network. A database with five catalytic products is trained and tested to predict more than 100,000 chemical reactions, with a lowest predicted mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.18 eV. The case studies show that the UADDCR software can facilitate chemical reactions by adjusting the inputs, a process which is millions of times faster than ab initio calculations and can accurately predict and design more than 100,000 chemical reactions.

Abstract: Objective
An analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impact in the Spanish Gaucher Disease (GD) community is presented here.
Patients & methods
The Spanish GD foundation (FEETEF) surveyed 113 GD patients from March 30 to April 27; all patients provided a verbal consent.
Results
110 surveys were analyzed. The median age was 47 years old (y.o.), 31 patients were ≥ 60 y.o.; and 34% of patients reported comorbidities. 46% (51/110) of patients were treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), 48 of them at hospitals; 45.1% (45/110) were on substrate reduction therapy (SRT) and 9% (10/110) receive no therapy. 25% (11/48) of ERT-hospital-based patients reported therapy interruptions, while SRT-patients did not report missing doses. No bone crises were reported. However, 50% (55/110) of patients reported being worried about their predisposition to a severe SARS-COV-2 infection and 29% (16/55) of them took anxiolytics or antidepressants for this. While 6 patients reported to have contact with an infected person, another two confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in splenectomyzed patients, one of them (a 79-year-old diabetic) died.
Conclusions
One quarter of the patients treated at hospitals reported dose interruptions. Home-based therapy may need to be considered in order to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract: Summary
Li-ion batteries based on Ni-rich layered cathodes are the state-of-the-art technology for electric vehicles; however, batteries using these advanced materials suffer from rapid performance fading. In this work, we report a critical turning point during the aging of graphite/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) full cells, after which the degradation is significantly accelerated. This turning point was identified using differential voltage analysis (DVA) applied to standard two-electrode data, which shows that graphite becomes progressively less lithiated, as confirmed by operando long-duration X-ray diffraction, and therefore has a higher electrochemical potential at the end of charge. This increase leads to a proportional increase in the cathode potential, and an accelerated impedance increase is observed from this point. This mechanism is expected to be universal for the vast majority of Li-ion battery chemistries, particularly for Ni-rich cathodes, whose degradation is extremely sensitive to the upper cutoff voltage, and our work provides fundamental guidelines for developing effective countermeasures.

Abstract: Summary
The long alkyl ligands on nanocrystal (NC) surfaces must be exchanged with short ligands to render NC films semiconducting for optoelectronic applications. It has become the consensus that through this process, it is unavoidable that detrimental cracks are induced due to the ligand volume loss. In this work, we demonstrate an advanced solid-state ligand exchange strategy to achieve crack-free PbS NC film in a single deposition step, through managing NC packing state and appropriate processing solvent selection. This strategy exhibits remarkable versatility for films with various thicknesses (up to 1 μm), substrates, and areas. The quality of the NC film is confirmed by solar cells as a representative application. The photovoltaic performance is on par with the reported state-of-the-art PbS NC solar cells. Our approach possesses the advantages of simplicity, “greener” processing, and lower materials costs, showing potential as a facile and reliable way to produce high-quality NC films for practical optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Fundamental investigations of reconstruction of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pre-catalysts and performance evaluation under realistic conditions are vital for practical water electrolysis. Here, we capture dynamic reconstruction, including the geometric/phase structure, of hydrate molybdates at oxidized potentials. Etching-reconstruction engineering endows the formed NiOOH with a sub-5-nm particle-interconnected structure, as revealed by multi-angle electron tomography. The key to complete reconstruction is the multicomponent co-leaching-induced loose reconstruction layer, conductive to solution penetration and mass transport. This unique structure avoids particle agglomeration in catalysis and promotes complete exploitation of the catalyst with 1,350 h of durability to meet industrial requirements. Upon addition of iron during reconstruction, mainstream Fe-NiOOH with a retained structure forms. Coupled with MoO2-Ni arrays in a membrane-free and two-electrode cell, it achieves stable electrolysis in industrial-concentration KOH for 260 h. This work highlights the reconstruction chemistry of hydrate oxygen-evolving systems and their performance evaluation under industrial conditions.

Here, by recognizing the distinct physicochemical properties of H+ and OH− in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we identify two key structures, FeN4 and graphitic-type N-CH (g-type N-CH), to be the catalytic active sites toward the ORR in acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively. This insight is confirmed experimentally by the careful design of a carbon-supported single Fe-atom catalyst (Fe-SAC) containing both of the active sites, which are found to work in synergy. The bi-active site Fe-SAC shows enhanced ORR activity, good long-term stability, and methanol tolerance, as well as the anticipated pH universality. By pinpointing and clarifying the active sites of SACs, this work may inspire chemists to design and synthesize cost-efficient SACs for the ORR.

Abstract: Gamma delta (γδ) T cell-based tumor immunotherapy has been one of the most promising cancer immunotherapeutic strategies. However, the key regulators of the Vγ9Vδ2 T cell-mediated antitumor response remain unclear. Recently, mounting reports have indicated that Tim-3 performs critical roles in the regulation of the activities of immune cells, including Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. However, the roles of Tim-3 in Vγ9Vδ2 T cell-mediated killing of colon cancer cells and the underlying mechanism remain largely unknown. Here, the proportion of Tim-3+ γδ T cells was significantly increased in both the peripheral blood and colon cancer tissue of patients and was significantly associated with TNM staging and tumor volume. Additionally, the activation of Tim-3 signaling significantly inhibited the killing efficiency of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells against colon cancer cells. In addition, Tim-3 signaling reduced the expression of perforin and granzyme B in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Blocking the perforin/granzyme B pathway also decreased the cytotoxicity of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells to colon cancer cells. Moreover, Tim-3 signaling reduced the perforin and granzyme B expression of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in an ERK1/2 signaling pathway-dependent manner. This knowledge reveals that Tim-3 may be a promising therapeutic target to improve Vγ9Vδ2 T cell-based adoptive immunotherapy for colon cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The quest for a suitable electrolyte formulation is pivotal to the success of rechargeable magnesium batteries. A simple conventional electrolyte having high compatibility with magnesium anode and cathode material is in great demand. Herein, we report a simple yet effective electrolyte formulation, comprising magnesium triflate (Mg(OTf)2) and magnesium chloride in monoglyme, that can enable highly reversible, conditioning-free, and homogeneous magnesium deposition. Galvanostatic Mg plating/stripping demonstrates an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% over 1,000 cycles. The cells show excellent performance at current densities up to 3 mA cm−2 and areal capacities up to 5 mAh cm−2. Post mortem analysis unveils the formation of a robust solid electrolyte interphase, which leads to improved kinetics at the magnesium electrode. A prototype Mg battery with Mo6S8 cathode demonstrates stable cycling performance over 100 cycles. This study shows that rational design of Mg(OTf)2-based electrolytes is a promising direction toward the realization of high-performance magnesium batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Self-assembly is one of the most popular ways to produce nanoparticle (NP) films, but it is still limited by expensive instruments, time-consuming processes, and poor controllability. Here we present a thermally induced, tension-gradient-driven nanoparticle self-assembly method to realize high-efficiency, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and controllable fabrication of large-area NP films. The driving force of this self-assembly method comes from the tension gradient of the air-liquid interface and particle-liquid interface. Meniscus shape, immersion velocity, and temperature have significant effects on self-assembly. The as-prepared ultrathin NP films are closely packed, and the number of layers can be well controlled, exhibit excellent superhydrophobic/superoleophilic properties, and can separate various oil-water mixtures with high efficiency. Moreover, the method is suitable for various 2D and 3D substrates, which may enable efficient and controllable fabrication of NP films.

Abstract: Cytokinesis of animal cells requires contraction of a contractile ring, composed of actin filaments and myosin II filaments. Phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (MRLC) promotes contraction of the actomyosin ring by activating myosin II motor activity. Both Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (Rho kinase/ROCK) and Zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIP kinase/ZIPK) have been reported to phosphorylate MRLC at the contractile ring. However, it remains unclear whether these kinases function independently of each other. Here, we clarified that ROCK colocalizes and forms a complex with ZIPK at telophase. As ROCK is reported to phosphorylate and activate ZIPK in vitro, we hypothesized that ZIPK phosphorylated by ROCK contributes to control cytokinesis. To address this, we expressed EGFP-ZIPK wild type (WT), a non-phosphorylatable mutant (T265A) or a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant (T265D) in HeLa cells and treated these cells with a ROCK inhibitor. Decrease in phosphorylated MRLC and a delay of furrow ingression by the ROCK inhibitor were rescued by the expression of EGFP-ZIPK-T265D, but not EGFP-ZIPK-WT or -T265A. This suggests that ROCK regulates MRLC phosphorylation followed by furrow ingression, through ZIPK phosphorylation.

Abstract: In vitro growth of hematopoietic cells depends on the presence of hematopoietic cytokines. To date, it is unclear if these cells would be able to respond to non-hematopoietic cytokines. In the present study, we have explored this by culturing human hematopoietic cells in presence of neurogenic cytokines. Lineage-negative (Lin−) umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived cells -enriched for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells- were cultured in presence of different combinations of hematopoietic cytokines, neurotrophins, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and neurogenic culture media, in a 3-phase culture system. A proportion (1–22%) of Lin− UCB hematopoietic cells normally express neural markers and are capable of responding to neural cytokines. Neural cytokines did not have effects on hematopoietic cell proliferation; however, we observed generation of neural-like cells, assessed by morphology, and a significant increase in the proportion of cells expressing neural markers. Such neural-like cells, however, retained expression of hematopoietic markers. It seems that under our culture conditions, no actual transdifferentiation of hematopoietic cells into neural cells occurred; instead, the cells generated in culture seem to be hematopoietic cells that acquired neural features upon contact with neurogenic factors. The identity of UCB cells that acquired a neural phenotype is still unclear.

Abstract: Summary
Rapid, robust virus-detection techniques with ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity are required for the outbreak of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we report that the femtomolar concentrations of single-stranded ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) of SARS-CoV-2 trigger ordering transitions in liquid crystal (LC) films decorated with cationic surfactant and complementary 15-mer single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) probe. More importantly, the sensitivity of the LC to the SARS ssRNA, with a 3-bp mismatch compared to the SARS-CoV-2 ssRNA, is measured to decrease by seven orders of magnitude, suggesting that the LC ordering transitions depend strongly on the targeted oligonucleotide sequence. Finally, we design a LC-based diagnostic kit and a smartphone-based application (app) to enable automatic detection of SARS-CoV-2 ssRNA, which could be used for reliable self-test of SARS-CoV-2 at home without the need for complex equipment or procedures.

Abstract: Summary
Diarylmethanamines as a structural motif are frequently encountered in bioactive molecules, drugs, pharmaceutical candidates, and ligands. However, the existing synthetic methods cannot meet the demand for diarylmethanamines. Here, we report a double-insertive coupling reaction of isocyanides with arylboronic acids under transition-metal-free conditions to deliver valuable diarylmethylamines. This coupling reaction features a broad range of substrate scope with good functional group compatibility, and it can also be employed in late-stage modification of bioactive compounds and drug molecules, as well as in ligand synthesis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the reaction is through the formation of boronic anhydride followed by two insertion reactions with isocyanide to access the diarylmethanamine derivatives, instead of direct insertion of isocyanide into arylboronic acid.

Abstract: Summary
Porphyrin-based catalysts are promising for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion. We report here molecular Cu-porphyrin-constructed porous frameworks for efficient CO2 reduction. This framework catalyst has a high Faradaic efficiency of 73.6% and a partial current density of 7.5 mA cm−2 at −1.4 V versus RHE for the selective production of hydrocarbons, while only carbon monoxide is generated on the Cu-porphyrin building blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that this porous framework has a high CO2 absorption capability, and abundant copper-active sites account for the efficient CO2 conversion. Moreover, finite-element simulations reveal that the spatial confinement of CO intermediates in the porous framework are critical for the efficient generation of hydrocarbons. This work may offer insights into designing efficient catalysts for CO2 reduction to valuable products.

Abstract: Summary
Tin selenide (SnSe) has notable thermoelectric properties, yet stable n-type polycrystalline SnSe is difficult to synthesize. Here, polycrystalline SnSe is easily prepared by arc-melting as robust pellets, with thermoelectric properties repeatably changing to negative Seebeck-coefficient above 580 K reaching a figure of merit ∼1.8 at 816 K. DC conductivity changes 4 orders of magnitude with temperature, whereas microwave conductivity increases only 4-fold, confirming the effects of oxidized grain boundaries. Effects of ambient oxygen exposure are probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Neutron powder diffraction reveals 3% Sn deficiency. Inelastic neutron scattering shows phonon spectrum consistent with ab initio calculations and reported Raman spectra, but with higher-energy modes strongly softened at higher temperatures. We thereby provide insight on undoped n-type polycrystalline SnSe that reveals high-performance at high temperature, being a suitable peer material for p-type SnSe.

Abstract: Summary
Supramolecular polymers are intriguing due to their thermal reversible and stimuli-responsive properties. However, most supramolecular polymers reported thus far have poor mechanical properties due to the low bonding energy of the non-covalent interactions. Here, we report a supramolecular polymer that is formed by small molecules, ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetrapropionic acid (EGTPA). Owing to the dense hydrogen bonding and low crystallinity, this material exhibits polymer-like properties—in other words, high mechanical strength and excellent plasticity. Thermal and environmental control over the dynamics of hydrogen bonding leads to many intriguing properties, such as thermal healing and tunable mechanical strength, in a way that is not accessible by traditional polymers. Based on these features, we further demonstrate its application in shape memory hybrids. Significant shape memory effect is observed, although neither of the components of the hybrids show the shape memory effect individually.

Abstract: Summary
Developing high-efficiency blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters is still a formidable challenge. Here, we report five blue TADF emitters designed by simply changing the frequently used methyl group (C1) to a longer one gradually to subtly adjust the energy levels. DAc-C1–DAc-C5 are developed by using diphenylsulfone (DPS) as the acceptor and acridine with different-length alkyl chains on C(9) as the donor groups. These five compounds have high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) (75%–84%) with blue emission. The DAc-C2-based OLED device exhibits the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 24.1% with CIE (0.15, 0.19), which is 1.42 times higher than that of state-of-the-art TADF OLEDs based on DAc-C1 (EQE: 17.0%) under the same conditions, confirming the power of the molecular design strategy. Furthermore, the crystal analyses partially explain the influence of the alkyl chain on the device property, demonstrating a new approach for achieving TADF luminogens with high performance.

Abstract: Summary
Wind energy is one of the most cost-effective energy sources available today. Some techniques have been developed to scavenge wind energy, but making use of lower flutter velocity while maintaining high conversion efficiency remains challenging. Here, we report a triboelectric nanogenerator composed of two interacting triboelectric films with four flapping modes, enabling an effective work wind velocity as low as 1.6 ms−1 and a high conversion efficiency of 3.23%, which, to our knowledge, are better than previously reported values of wind energy scavenging. The output performance of B-TENG can be determined by device size and flow velocity; the optimized device exhibits an output voltage, current, and power of 175 V, 43 μA, and 2.5 mW, respectively, with dimensions of 3 × 8 × 2 cm3 at a flow velocity of 8 ms−1. The B-TENG may pave the way for future wind scavenging devices for a range of point-of-use applications.

Abstract: Summary
To date, the development of the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysts to achieve high ammonia production at low overpotentials is insufficient. Here, Sb2Te3 displays notable electrochemical NRR performance at 0 V (versus RHE), with an ammonia yield rate of 13.8 μg h−1 cm−2 and a faradic efficiency of 27.7% (the highest yield rate at low overpotentials reported, to the best of our knowledge). Sb2Te3 is also stable over 50 h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that there are multiple promoted-synergetic effects in telluride. Tellurium sites can modulate the electronic structure of catalysts to drive nitrogen adsorption on antimony sites. Tellurium sites also allow surface hydrogenation to suppress hydrogen evolution, facilitate the reduction of nitrogen into ∗NNH (the rate-determining step) in NRR, and accelerate the desorption of NH3. The other tellurides (CoTe2, CdTe, and Bi3Te4) also show high NRR performance at low overpotentials, implying that such multiple promoted-synergism may be generalized.

Abstract: Summary
Broad use of global or spatially averaging measurements over a cell to characterize highly localized Li plating phenomena in lithium-ion batteries during fast charging has created a disconnect between measurements and the underlying causes. Consequently, the field is missing a clear path to implementing fast charging as well as to expand into extreme fast charging (XFC). Aiming to bridge these gaps, we present a detailed look into local detection of Li plating and the consequent cycle life implications for electrodes and cells under XFC by utilizing electrochemistry and high-energy X-ray diffraction. Significant heterogeneity in Li plating during XFC results in accelerated and non-uniform cycle life losses, in contrast to the prevailing acceptance that C rate is correlated to Li plating for XFC. This behavior is triggered by local electrode heterogeneity, which has yet to be identified and is not apparent in volume-averaged quantifications. A better understanding of these multiscale local electrode heterogeneities is crucial for identifying pathways to enable XFC.

Abstract: Summary
Transparent materials with high impact absorption are required for many safety-critical engineering systems. Existing transparent tough composites have increased impact resistance but often fail catastrophically because of poor impact absorption. We propose a transparent impact-absorbing composite that reproduces the toughening mechanism involving sacrificial bonds and hidden lengths in spider silk. Our material consists of an elastomer matrix and an instability-assisted, 3D-printed, bidirectional fabric of microstructured fibers with sacrificial bonds and alternating loops. Under impact, the hidden loops unfold after bond breaking and matrix cracking, resisting impactor penetration with graceful failure. The large-scale plastic deformation of the unfolding loops significantly increases energy dissipation and leads to hysteresis of 95.6% (dissipated energy/total absorbed energy × 100%), minimizing the released elastic energy and reducing the rebounding damage. Our approach opens a new avenue for designing and manufacturing transparent high-energy-absorbing composites for impact protection applications.

Abstract: Summary
Innovations in batteries can require years of experimentation for design and optimization. We report an autonomous approach to the optimization of a battery electrolyte that uses machine learning coupled to a robotic test-stand to perform hundreds of sequential experiments. We search for mixtures of salts in aqueous electrolytes with high electrochemical stability using Bayesian optimization. In 40 hours of experimentation testing for 140 electrolyte formulas, we converge on a non-intuitive optimal electrolyte. The optimum is a mixed-anion sodium electrolyte that is more stable than a benchmark electrolyte, despite lower salt content, contrary to the known design principle. The precision and repeatability of the robotic test-stand distinguishes formulations that human-guided design may have missed. Our result demonstrates the possibility of integrating robotics with machine learning to discover novel battery materials. We provide a dataset characterizing 251 aqueous electrolytes containing LiNO3, LiClO4, Li2SO4, NaNO3, NaClO4, and Na2SO4 that includes conductivities, pHs, and electrochemical responses on platinum.

Abstract: Summary
Selecting moderate semiconducting materials for photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells is essential to achieve high solar-energy conversion. Despite the advantageous features of silicon, such as earth abundance and narrow band gap, silicon suffers from severe photocorrosion. Here, heterogeneous nickel-based catalysts produced via electrodeposition are investigated to expedite water oxidation and protect the silicon from corrosion. The morphology of the catalysts and their PEC performances are demonstrated in detail. Synergistic Ni nanoparticles (NPs)/Ni(OH)2/n-Si photoanode shows a high photocurrent density of 29.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE and operates over 140 h. Owing to the insufficient photovoltage generated by a single photoanode, we introduce a perovskite/Si tandem solar cell as a voltage supplier. The fabricated wired tandem device shows a photocurrent density of 9.8 mA cm−2, corresponding to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 12% without external bias. Our work may present a promising pathway toward a design of spontaneous energy conversion devices.

Abstract: Summary
Electrokinetic energy conversion by streaming current was proposed for energy harvesting for >50 years; however, it proved to be of limited use due to low efficiencies. The recent emergence of nanomaterials and related technologies significantly increased these efficiencies. Here, we report an electrokinetic energy conversion system using a single stream of ballistic droplets from which we obtain close to 80% efficiency with 25 kV generated voltage. The voltage can be reduced to a minimum of 4 kV while maintaining ∼40% efficiency, a promising feature from the point of view of applications. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of integration with 9 microjets as a conversion unit, which generates 1.9 mW with an efficiency of 35%. We experimentally achieve a power density of 8.4 kW/m2 under 0.4 bar pressure and an upper limit of 84 kW/m2 using denser pore arrays. Our results demonstrate efficient ballistic energy conversion, as well as the potential for integrated applications.

Abstract: Summary
Reaching high current densities is absolutely imperative for electrochemical energy conversion, from fuel cells to CO2 reduction. Here, we identify the existence of a performance indicator for gas-evolving electrochemical energy conversion devices: the critical current density. The critical current density pinpoints a performance inflection point whereby both the gas saturations and mass transport overpotentials suddenly dominate cell performance and exacerbate failure. We elucidate the mass transport behavior of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer using in operando neutron imaging at operating current densities as high as 9 A ⋅ cm−2. Product gases become heterogeneously distributed in the porous transport layer adjacent to the catalyst layer and promote disastrous local hotspots. Optimizing new materials and cell architectures with this performance indicator may unlock higher than previously reported performances for electrochemical energy conversion.
Keywords: polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer; critical current density; neutron imaging; gas saturation; reactant flow regime; porous transport layer

Abstract: Blood levels of cardiac troponins (cTn) and myoglobin are analysed when myocardial infarction (MI) is suspected. Here we describe a novel clearance mechanism for muscle proteins by muscle cells. The complete plasma clearance profile of cTn and myoglobin was followed in rats after intravenous or intermuscular injections and analysed by PET and fluorescence microscopy of muscle biopsies and muscle cells. Compared with intravenous injections, only 5 % of cTnT, 0.6 % of cTnI and 8 % of myoglobin were recovered in the circulation following intramuscular injection. In contrast, 47 % of the renal filtration marker FITC-sinistrin and 81 % of cTn fragments from MI-patients were recovered after intramuscular injection. In addition, PET and biopsy analysis revealed that cTn was taken up by the quadriceps muscle and both cTn and myoglobin were endocytosed by cultured muscle cells. This local clearance mechanism could possibly be the dominant clearance mechanism for cTn, myoglobin and other muscle damage biomarkers released by muscle cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mouths offer the perfect environments for microbial cell formation, promoting the growth of biofilms, for example, on teeth. Dental biofilm exhibits strong resistance to antibiotics and is a cause of many dental diseases. Common strategies for dental biofilm removal involve the addition of high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which increases tooth sensitivity, or mechanical procedures. Here, we report a different approach based on self-propelled micromachines with high antibacterial activity for the degradation of dental biofilm. Such microrobots use low concentrations of fuel for their propulsion, and they achieve an efficient dental biofilm disruption in only 5 min of treatment. Moreover, these microrobots are biocompatible with epidermal and organ cells and may stimulate the immune system to fight against microbial infection. This approach of exploiting the active motion of bubble-propelled catalytic micromachines for oral biofilm disruption may open the door for more efficient and sophisticated treatments in dentistry.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanism of the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and finding a design principle to enhance the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts are of great significance in paving the way of alkaline water electrolysis. Here, taking cobalt phosphide (CoP) as a model material, we establish the alkaline HER activity trends as a function of a fundamental property, the proportion of the unoccupied 3d orbital (Pun). By doping CoP with a range of 3d and 4d transition metals with different Pun, we show that the intrinsic alkaline HER kinetics increases with Pun. DFT calculations indicate that the transition metals with higher Pun not only act as the oxophilic sites for enhanced water activation but also modulate the electronic structure of CoP to endow an optimized H adsorption (ΔG∗H). Moreover, by further comparing the correlation between water adsorption and dissociation or ΔG∗H and experimental alkaline HER activities, we find that water dissociation is the rate-determining step for alkaline HER.

Abstract: Summary
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) exhibit potential to become a key technology for future clean energy systems. The metal-supported SOFC exhibits decisive strengths like fast start-up capability, mechanical robustness, and acceptable cost, making it the concept of choice for mobile applications. As a promising example, SOFC-powered range extenders for electric vehicles offer fast refueling and significantly increased driving range, while lowering size, weight, and the cost of the vehicle’s battery. Here, we report the development of a metal-supported SOFC aiming at exceptionally high power density. A knowledge-based improvement of all electrochemically active cell components enables a performance increase up to a factor of 10 and demonstrates the effectiveness of target-oriented optimization of processing and microstructure. Ultimately, enhanced cells meet the industrial performance target by providing a current density of 2.8 A × cm−2 at 650°C and 0.7 V, setting a benchmark for SOFC performance.

Abstract: Summary
The segregation (or exsolution) of nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of perovskite oxide parents has emerged as an advanced technology to design functional materials for renewable energy. However, this process relies heavily upon lengthy reduction (800–1,200 K) in hydrogen-rich environments to facilitate the electron transfer from hydrogen to oxides, making this process costly. Here, we show that, in addition to thermal driving forces, photo-illumination can drive electron donation and facilitate the electron harvesting on perovskite directly. This results in segregation of NPs at room temperature with the assistance of trialkyl amine as a hole acceptor. A proton-coupled electron transfer catalytic cycle is suggested to explain this unusual electron transfer pathway, which is redox neutral and an intrinsically closed cycle. The practicality of this process is demonstrated by the improved performance in a trial electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work suggests a promising design principle for perovskite functionalization.

Abstract: Summary
The agglomeration of self-assembled fibers of π-conjugated molecules is crucial to the formation of low-molecular-weight supramolecular gels. However, identification of the in situ spectroscopic signatures of fiber agglomeration has remained a challenging endeavor. Here, we use a combination of chiroptical techniques, namely circular dichroism (CD), magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), and fluorescence-detected circular dichroism (FDCD), to investigate the agglomeration of self-assembled fibers of a chiral low-molecular-weight gelator, l-alanine-substituted perylene imide bis(n-butyl) ester (PIBE). Surprisingly, we find that agglomerated PIBE fibers exhibit an opposite CD signature in comparison to the isolated PIBE fibers. In contrast, the MCD and FDCD responses do not change during the agglomeration process, revealing that the local structure in the individual fibers is unperturbed. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we conclude that the effective charge on the fibers dictates the agglomeration process and that the final geometry of the agglomerated fibers is marked by crossed nodes.

Abstract: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a kind of myeloproliferative disorder caused by a constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib and its derivatives, have achieved great progress in the treatment of CML. However, many CML patients do not respond to TKIs alone. p19INK4d, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, plays important roles in proliferation, DNA damage repair, apoptosis and cell differentiation, but its role in CML is unknown. Herein, we found that the expression of p19INK4d in CML patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls. p19INK4d overexpression inhibits cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, and cooperates with imatinib to inhibit CML more effectively in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, p19INK4d decreased the expression of BCR-ABL and its downstream molecules p-Mek1/2, moreover, the expression of Gli-1, c-myc, MUC1, Shh and TC48 also reduced significantly. Collectively, p19INK4d inhibits proliferation and enhances imatinib efficacy in the treatment of CML. These findings maybe have implications for developing potential targets to increase imatinib sensitivity for CML.

Abstract: Summary
Engineering the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is a promising approach to improving Li metal battery performance. Recent work has shown that alkali metal additives can lead to smooth Li deposits, yet the underlying mechanisms are not understood. In this work, we demonstrate that alkali metal additives (here, K+) alter SEI composition, thickness, and solubility. Through post-mortem elemental analyses, we find that K+ ions do not deposit, but instead modify the reactivity of the electrode-electrolyte interface. Using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT), we show that K+ mitigates solvent decomposition at the Li metal surface. These findings suggest that alkali metal additives can be leveraged to suppress the formation of undesired SEI components (e.g., Li2CO3, soluble organic species), serving as an alternative approach for SEI modification compared to sacrificial additives. We believe that our work will spur further interest in the underexplored area of cation engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Mixed-matrix membranes have great potential for post-combustion carbon capture. To make membrane-based carbon capture economically viable, new formulations with high selectivity and CO2 permeance must be identified. We demonstrate here the ability to break the permeability-selectivity trade-off by using multicomponent mixed-matrix membranes (McMMMs) with two, three, or four components. Each of these components has a specific function and is designed for compatibility and high separation performance. A highly permeable polymer of intrinsic microporosity, PIM-1, and a CO2-selective polyphosphazene polymer, MEEP80, are chosen as polymer matrices. Chemical interaction between MOF nanoparticles and polymers is a key factor for optimizing the MOF-polymer interfacial compatibility. The systematic study of the impact of MOF pore size and the binding site is investigated to produce 10 different composite membranes. The permeability-selectivity values surpass the Robeson upper bound, while the predicted cost of carbon capture is reduced, which suggests the potential of these membranes for practical CO2 separations.

Abstract: Summary
Ceramic-polymer electrolytes are expected to improve safety, energy density, and power of next-generation battery technologies. The realization of this type of battery is, however, hindered by the high interfacial resistance across the ceramic-polymer interface. Here, we report a surface-modification strategy to lower the interfacial resistance by more than four orders of magnitude. For this purpose, we activate the surface-terminated oxygen of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) particles by plasma etching and functionalize them by immersing the LLZTO particles in a (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (Si-R) solution to form covalently bonded Si-R layers. The Si-Rs are terminated by an epoxy group that reacts with the hydroxyl group of the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) via a ring-opening reaction. The modifications improve the screening of the oxygen polarity of LLZTO particles and lower the free volume between both components, resulting in a LLZTO|PEO interface resistance of 500 Ω cm2 at 20°C, the lowest value reported so far to the best of our knowledge.

Abstract: To define morphological changes in carotid and cerebral arteries in sickle cell transgenic mice (SS) as they age, a combination of ultrasound and microcomputed tomography of plastinated arteries was used to quantify arterial dimensions and changes in mice 4, 12, and 24 weeks of age. 12-week SS mice had significantly larger common carotid artery diameters than AS mice, which continued through to the extracranial and intracranial portions of the internal carotid artery (ICA). There were also side specific differences in diameters between the left and right vessels. Significant ICA tapering along its length occurred by 12- and 24-weeks in SS mice, decreasing by as much as 70%. Significant narrowing along the length was also measured in SS anterior cerebral arteries at 12- and 24-weeks, but not AS. Collectively, these findings indicate that sickle cell anemia induces arterial remodeling in 12- and 24-weeks old mice. Catalog of measurements are also provided for the common carotid, internal carotid, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral arteries for AS and SS genotypes, as a reference for other investigators using mathematical and computational models of age-dependent arterial complications caused by sickle cell anemia.

Abstract: Summary
Pyroelectric energy-conversion research is focused on harvesting from waste heat. Meanwhile, there is a need for portable power with extended lifetimes and energy densities. Here, we demonstrate the potential for a portable power concept using pyroelectric energy conversion driven by the heat from on-chip catalytic combustion of methanol. Given the high energy density of liquid fuels (22 MJ/kg for methanol), system conversion efficiencies of only 3% bring the energy density close to Li-ion batteries (∼0.8 MJ/kg). Nanostructured iridium oxide serves as the top electrode and combustion catalyst, with light-off temperatures as low as 105°C. The in-operando energy-conversion performance is measured for thin film La-doped lead zirconate titanate, showing a 2.5× increase in power when operating at the phase transition compared to room temperature. Energy-conversion densities of 48 mJ/cm3 are extracted from the on-chip combustion experiments between temperatures of 230°C and 255°C.

Abstract: Metastasis, a process that requires tumor cell dissemination followed by tumor growth, is the primary cause of death in cancer patients. An essential step of tumor cell dissemination is intravasation, a process by which tumor cells cross the blood vessel endothelium and disseminate to distant sites. Studying this process is of utmost importance given that intravasation in the primary tumor, as well as the secondary and tertiary metastases, is the key step in the systemic spread of tumor cells, and that this process continues even after removal of the primary tumor. High-resolution intravital imaging of the tumor microenvironment of breast carcinoma has revealed that tumor cell intravasation exclusively occurs at doorways, termed “Tumor MicroEnvironment of Metastasis” (TMEM), composed of three different cell types: a Tie2high/VEGFhigh perivascular macrophage, a Mena overexpressing tumor cell, and an endothelial cell, all in direct contact. In this review article, we discuss the interactions between these cell types, the subsequent signaling events which lead to tumor cell intravasation, and the role of invadopodia in supporting tumor cell invasion and dissemination. We end our review by discussing how the knowledge acquired from the use of intravital imaging is now leading to new clinical trials targeting tumor cell dissemination and preventing metastatic progression.

Abstract: Ploidy, besides known translocations in lymphoblasts, is a strong predictor of prognosis in B- cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). While hyperdiploidy with >50 chromosomes shows a favourable outcome, hypodiploidy with <45 chromosomes have a dismal clinical outcome. However, there exists a small subset where both the hypodiploid and hyperdiploid clones are apparent either by cytogenetics or flow cytometry and are defined partially masked hypodiploids or mosaics based on the percentage of clonal population. These patients are essentially hypodiploids, and show the hyperdiploid clone as a consequence of endoreduplication of the primary hypodiploid clone- A phenomenon of successive replication of genome without mitosis (cytokinesis) resulting in increased ploidy. In the current study, we present the complete clinical, hematological and cytogenetic profile of 11 such newly diagnosed mosaics or partially masked hypodiploid BCP-ALL cases.

Abstract: Summary
Iodide migration causes degradation of the perovskite solar cells. Here, we observe the direct migration of iodide into the hole-transport layer in a device. We demonstrate that ultrathin room temperature atomic layer-deposited Al2O3 on the perovskite surface very effectively hinders the migration. The perovskite-Al2O3 interface enables charge transfer across the Al2O3 layer in the solar cells, without causing any drastic changes in the properties of the perovskite absorber. Furthermore, it helps to preserve the initial properties of the perovskite film during exposure to light and air under real operating conditions, and thus, improves the stability of the solar cells. The ultrathin Al2O3 layer deposited at room temperature significantly increases the lifetime of the perovskite solar cells, and we hope this may be a step toward the mass production of stable devices.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleation site distribution is ubiquitous in many natural and industrial processes, such as liquid-to-vapor phase change, gas-evolving reactions, and solid-state material growth. However, a comprehensive understanding of nucleation site distribution remains elusive. These limitations are due to the challenge of probing micro/nanoscopic nucleation sites and inadequate statistical interpretation of the nucleation process. Here we report direct experimental observation of nucleation site distribution in droplet condensation using phase-enhanced environmental scanning electron microscopy. We also use statistical theory to demonstrate that the population of nucleation sites is governed by the Poisson distribution, whereas the nearest-neighbor distance follows the Rayleigh distribution instead of the commonly used Poisson distribution. We further show the broad applicability of these insights into nucleation site distribution to hydrogen-evolving reactions and chemical vapor deposition. Our platform, combining precise characterization and theory, advances the fundamental understanding of nucleation phenomena and guides designs from materials to devices.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the interactions of graphene oxide (GO)-based materials with biological systems is critical due to the potential applications of these materials. Here, we investigate the extent to which single- to few-layer GO sheets of different controlled lateral dimensions translocate from the nose to the brain following intranasal instillation. We explore tissue location and in vivo biodegradability of the translocated materials using various techniques. Mass spectrometry and confocal Raman analyses indicate that trace amounts of GO undergo nose-to-brain translocation in a size-dependent manner. The smallest GO-sheet size category (us-GO, 10-550 nm) gains the greatest access to the brain in terms of quantity and coverage. Confocal Raman mapping and immunofluorescence combinations show that in vivo, us-GO resides in association with microglia. Point-and-shoot Raman spectroscopy shows that trace quantities of us-GO are maintained over 1 month, but undergo biodegradation-related changes. This study adds to growing awareness regarding the fate of graphene-based materials in biological systems.

Abstract: Summary
Thin crystalline silicon (c-Si) showing outstanding flexibility has been considered as an active material for flexible solar cells. However, an effective photon management should be developed for thin c-Si, which shows severe light absorption loss. Here, we introduce random inverted-pyramidal polydimethylsiloxane (RIP-PDMS) films on the surface of the thin c-Si solar cell to simultaneously secure high absorption and flexibility. Attaching the RIP-PDMS film on the front surface of the device can significantly reduce surface reflection; near-infrared light recycling can be further improved by attaching a metal-coated RIP-PDMS film on the rear surface of the device. Notably, thin c-Si solar cells with RIP-PDMS films have an efficiency of 18.4% and exhibit a constant efficiency during 1,000 repeated bending tests with a bending radius of 10 mm. Also, finite-difference time-domain simulations confirm that the RIP-PDMS films increase the light diffusion and optical path length inside the c-Si.

Abstract: Summary
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite is a front-runner material for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its high light-absorption coefficient, narrow band gap, and superior photostability and thermostability. High-quality FAPbI3 perovskite formation typically requires an >160°C annealing process to induce phase transition from the photoinactive yellow phase (δ-FAPbI3) to the photoactive black phase (α-FAPbI3). However, this high-temperature annealing can induce defects in the films and hinders application in flexible solar cells. Here, we report a facile method to fabricate high-quality α-FAPbI3 perovskite films at room temperature, without thermal annealing or vacuum-assisted processes. Combined computational and experimental results reveal the crystallization mechanism of α-FAPbI3 formation at room temperature. We demonstrate PSCs with a power-conversion efficiency of 19.09%, which is the highest efficiency for room temperature PSCs to the best of our knowledge. This study may offer a cost-effective way to fabricate highly efficient PSCs at room temperature.

Abstract: Summary
Dissolution of transition metals from high-voltage cathodes and their incorporation into the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) of carbonaceous anodes drastically reduces the lifetime of Li-ion batteries. The effects of dissolved transition metals on the performance of carbonaceous anodes are well characterized; however, the impact on Li-metal anode performance and the SEI is rarely considered. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy to reveal the impact of dissolved Ni on the SEI formation process on Li-metal. A link between Ni incorporation into the SEI and the failure of Li-metal batteries is established. We find that Ni is reduced into its metallic state and incorporates as small clusters into the SEI, locally changing the chemistry and nanostructure of the SEI. These chemical and nanostructure changes locally modify the Li-ion and electron transport properties of the SEI, accelerating electrolyte decomposition, increasing formation of “dead” Li, and ultimately causing failure.

Abstract: Summary
Haloaromatic drug molecules of the amiloride family are plagued by photodegradation with associated toxicity. Herein, we report on the photodegradation of analogs of amiloride, which are known to undergo photosubstitution in water. Model compounds built on the same scaffold undergo clean photosubstitution also in alcoholic solvent, where a certain amount of photodehalogenation is normally expected. Available evidence points to a mechanism starting with photoexcitation followed by photoionization to give a radical cation intermediate. Subsequent substitution reaction with the protic solvent is assisted by a general base, possibly strengthened by the proximal solvated electron. Recombination with the solvated electron generates the observed product. Quantum chemical computations reveal that excited state antiaromaticity is relieved when an electron is ejected from the photoexcited molecule by the second photon. The mechanism indicated here could have wide applicability to photoinduced degradation of similar heteroaromatic compounds in the environment, as well as to a class of increasingly popular synthetic photoredox methods.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of a battery energy storage system (BESS) to serve multiple applications makes it a promising technology to enable the sustainable energy transition. However, high investment costs are a considerable barrier to BESS deployment, and few profitable application scenarios exist at present. Here, we show that by tapping into multiple revenue streams using the dynamic stacking of applications, profitable operation is viable under current regulatory conditions. We develop a multi-use optimization framework which distinguishes between behind-the-meter and in-front-of-the-meter applications and considers how power capacity is allotted in addition to energy capacity allocation. The algorithm uses a rolling horizon optimization with an integrated degradation model and is fed with real-world data from a stationary lithium-ion battery in Germany. When combining peak shaving with frequency containment reserve, a net present value per Euro invested of 1.00 is achieved, and 1.24 with the addition of arbitrage trading on the intraday continuous market.

Abstract: Summary
Na-based hydroborates, such as NaCB9H10, Na2B10H10, NaCB11H12, and Na2B12H12, are known for their high ionic conductivity above a phase transition, usually far from room temperature. Here, a systematic investigation to suppress this phase transition and thus to stabilize novel crystal structures is conducted by means of anion mixing. The obtained compounds crystallize either with hexagonal and cubic close packed (hcp and ccp) or body-centered cubic (bcc) arrangement of anions without polymorphic evolution in the temperature range 100 < T < 700 K. The high symmetry and the configurational ionic disorder, which characterize all crystals, give room-temperature Na+ conductivity close or above 1 mS cm−1. Finally, high oxidative electrochemical stability between 3 and 4 V versus Na+/Na results from the aromatic nature of the boron cage, making Na-based hydroborates potentially suitable as efficient solid electrolytes for next-generation, high-voltage, Na-ion batteries.

Regulation of invadosomes by microtubules: Not only a matter of railways,

Abstract: Invadosomes, which encompass podosomes and invadopodia, are actin rich adhesive and protrusive structures facilitating invasion and migration in various cell types. Podosomes are mostly found in normal cells, while invadopodia are hallmarks of invasive transformed cells. Despite evident structural differences, both structures mostly rely on the same pathways for their formation and their activity. While the role of actin cytoskeleton is undeniable, the involvement of microtubules (MTs) in invadosome formation/activity has recently been demonstrated but also somehow underestimated. MTs are components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton well known for their essential roles for cell division, the maintenance of cell shape, intracellular transport and cell motility. Until now, MTs were mostly seen as railways for the delivery of various cargos required for invadosome functions but recent data suggest a more complex role. In this review, we address the specific functions of MTs on invadosome dynamics, activity, maturation and organization in light with recent data, which extended far beyond simple track delivery. Indeed, MT dynamic instability, which in turn modulates Rho GTPase signalling and likely MT post-translational modifications are playing major roles in invadosome functions.

Abstract: Summary
All-solid-state electrolytes are widely understood to be required for energy-dense storage/conversion devices. Persistent problems associated with low ionic conductivity, poor charge transport across explicit and implicit interfaces, and inferior chemical stability continue to pose significant barriers to progress. Here, we synthesize and study a series of gel (or “quasi-solid-state”) electrolytes that can overcome many of the known limitations of their all-solid-state analogs. We discover that in two physical states, solvent-in-polymer (SIP) and polymer-in-solvent (PIS), the electrolytes offer exceptional ion-transport and stability characteristics. In both states, crystallization of the polymer component and thermodynamic activity of the solvent are lowered, allowing the electrolytes to achieve attractive combinations of ion transport, thermal, and electrochemical stability. Moreover, the SIP-PIS electrolytes can be in situ polymerized inside an electrochemical cell, resulting in fast kinetics for LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode with areal capacity of 2.5 mAh/cm2 and long-term stability toward lithium metal anode over 1,200 h.
