Abstract: Maintaining the homeostasis of the placental vasculature is of paramount importance for ensuring normal fetal growth and development. Any disruption in this balance can lead to perinatal morbidity. Several studies have uncovered an association between high levels of oxidized cholesterol (oxysterols), and complications during pregnancy, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and preeclampsia (PE). These complications often coincide with disturbances in placental vascular function. Here, we investigate the role of two oxysterols (7-ketocholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol) in (dys)function of primary fetoplacental endothelial cells (fpEC). Our findings reveal that oxysterols exert a disruptive influence on fpEC function by elevating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interfering with mitochondrial transmembrane potential, leading to its depolarization. Moreover, oxysterol-treated fpEC exhibited alterations in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) levels, resulting in the reorganization of cell junctions and a corresponding increase in membrane stiffness and vascular permeability. Additionally, we observed an enhanced adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to fpEC following oxysterol treatment. We explored the influence of activating the Liver X Receptor (LXR) with the synthetic agonist T0901317 (TO) on oxysterol-induced endothelial dysfunction in fpEC. Our results demonstrate that LXR activation effectively reversed oxysterol-induced ROS generation, monocyte adhesion, and cell junction permeability in fpEC. Although the effects on mitochondrial depolarization and calcium mobilization did not reach statistical significance, a strong trend towards stabilization of calcium mobilization was evident in LXR-activated cells. Taken together, our results suggest that high levels of systemic oxysterols link to placental vascular dysfunction and LXR agonists may alleviate their impact on fetoplacental vasculature.

Abstract: The anticancer drug cisplatin (CisPt) injures post-mitotic neuronal cells, leading to neuropathy. Furthermore, CisPt triggers cell death in replicating cells. Here, we aim to unravel the relevance of different types of CisPt-induced DNA lesions for evoking neurotoxicity. To this end, we comparatively analyzed wild-type and loss of function mutants of C. elegans lacking key players of specific DNA repair pathways. Deficiency in ercc-1, which is essential for nucleotide excision repair (NER) and interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair, revealed the most pronounced enhancement in CisPt-induced neurotoxicity with respect to the functionality of post-mitotic chemosensory AWA neurons, without inducing neuronal cell death. Potentiation of CisPt-triggered neurotoxicity in ercc-1 mutants was accompanied by complex alterations in both basal and CisPt-stimulated mRNA expression of genes involved in the regulation of neurotransmission, including cat-4, tph-1, mod-1, glr-1, unc-30 and eat-18. Moreover, xpf-1, csb-1, csb-1;xpc-1 and msh-6 mutants were significantly more sensitive to CisPt-induced neurotoxicity than the wild-type, whereas xpc-1, msh-2, brc-1 and dog-1 mutants did not distinguish from the wild-type. The majority of DNA repair mutants also revealed increased basal germline apoptosis, which was analyzed for control. Yet, only xpc-1, xpc-1;csb-1 and dog-1 mutants showed elevated apoptosis in the germline following CisPt treatment. To conclude, we provide evidence that neurotoxicity, including sensory neurotoxicity, is triggered by CisPt-induced DNA intra- and interstrand crosslinks that are subject of repair by NER and ICL repair. We hypothesize that especially ERCC1/XPF, CSB and MSH6-related DNA repair protects from chemotherapy-induced neuropathy in the context of CisPt-based anticancer therapy.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LD) are highly dynamic organelles specialized for the regulation of energy storage and cellular homeostasis. LD consist of a neutral lipid core surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer membrane with embedded proteins, most of which are involved in lipid homeostasis. In this study, we focused on one of the major LD proteins, sterol C24-methyltransferase, encoded by ERG6. We found that the absence of Erg6p resulted in an increased accumulation of yeast perilipin Pet10p in LD, while the disruption of PET10 was accompanied by Erg6p LD over-accumulation. An observed reciprocal enrichment of Erg6p and Pet10p in pet10Δ and erg6Δ mutants in LD, respectively, was related to specific functional changes in the LD and was not due to regulation on the expression level. The involvement of Pet10p in neutral lipid homeostasis was observed in experiments that focused on the dynamics of neutral lipid mobilization as time-dependent changes in the triacylglycerols (TAG) and steryl esters (SE) content. We found that the kinetics of SE hydrolysis was reduced in erg6Δ cells and the mobilization of SE was completely lost in mutants that lacked both Erg6p and Pet10p. In addition, we observed that decreased levels of SE in erg6Δpet10Δ was linked to an overexpression of steryl ester hydrolase Yeh1p. Lipid analysis of erg6Δpet10Δ showed that PET10 deletion altered the composition of ergosterol intermediates which had accumulated in erg6Δ. In conclusion, yeast perilipin Pet10p functionally interacts with Erg6p during the metabolism of ergosterol.

Abstract: The biosynthetic capability of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in teleosts are highly diversified due to evolutionary events such as gene loss and subsequent neo- and/or sub-functionalisation of enzymes encoded by existing genes. In the present study, we have comprehensively characterised genes potentially involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis, namely one front-end desaturase (fads2) and eight fatty acid elongases (elovl1a, elovl1b, elovl4a, elovl4b, elovl5, elovl7, elovl8a and elovl8b) from an amphidromous teleost, Ayu sweetfish, Plecoglossus altivelis. Functional analysis confirmed Fads2 with Δ6, Δ5 and Δ8 desaturase activities towards multiple PUFA substrates and several Elovl enzymes exhibited elongation capacities towards C18–20 or C18–22 PUFA substrates. Consequently, P. altivelis possesses a complete enzymatic capability to synthesise physiologically important LC-PUFA including arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) from their C18 precursors. Interestingly, the loss of elovl2 gene in P. altivelis was corroborated by genomic and phylogenetic analyses. However, this constraint would possibly be overcome by the function of alternative Elovl enzymes, such as Elovl1b, which has not hitherto been functionally characterised in teleosts. The present study contributes novel insights into LC-PUFA biosynthesis in the relatively understudied teleost group, Osmeriformes (Stomiati), thereby enhancing our understanding of the complement of LC-PUFA biosynthetic genes within teleosts.

Abstract: Background
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presents ongoing therapeutic challenges due to its intricate molecular pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the role of RNA binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) in AML cell proliferation, apoptosis, and chemosensitivity, and its potential modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
Methods
In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted using AML cell lines (K562 and U937) and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) from AML patients and healthy donors. RBM39 mRNA and protein levels were measured using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Cells were transfected with sh-RBM39 or sh-control, and then treated with daunorubicin (DNR) or homoharringtonine (HHT) at varied concentrations. Cell proliferation, chemosensitivity, and apoptosis were assessed through CCK-8 assay and Annexin V–APC/PI staining. RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) post RBM39 knockdown. An in vivo xenograft AML model using E7070, a selective RBM39 inhibitor, was employed to evaluate RBM39 modulation effects.
Results
Elevated RBM39 levels were found in AML patients and cell lines compared to controls. RBM39 knockdown promoted apoptosis, curtailed cell proliferation, and enhanced chemosensitivity to DNR and HHT in vitro. Drug-resistant or relapsed AML patients displayed higher RBM39 levels. RNA sequencing after RBM39 knockdown revealed downregulated PI3K/AKT signaling. The xenograft model validated in vitro results, as E7070 treatment suppressed AML xenograft growth via RBM39-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway suppression.
Conclusion
RBM39 plays a pivotal role in AML progression through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Targeting RBM39, potentially with E7070, could inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in AML cells, offering a promising avenue for future AML research and treatment.

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis is a common systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by damage to joints, inflammation and pain. It is driven by an increase of inflammatory cytokines and lipids mediators such as prostaglandins. Epoxides of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are lipid chemical mediators in a group of regulatory compounds termed eicosanoids. These epoxy fatty acids (EpFA) have resolutive functions but are rapidly metabolized by the soluble epoxide hydrolase enzyme (sEH) into the corresponding diols. The pharmacological inhibition of sEH stabilizes EpFA from hydrolysis, improving their half-lives and biological effects. These anti-inflammatory EpFA, are analgesic in neuropathic and inflammatory pain conditions. Nonetheless, inhibition of sEH on arthritis and the resulting effects on eicosanoids profiles are little explored despite the physiological importance. In this study, we investigated the effect of sEH inhibition on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and its impact on the plasma eicosanoid profile. We measured the eicosanoid metabolites by LC–MS/MS-based lipidomic analysis. The treatment with a sEH inhibitor significantly modulated 11 out of 69 eicosanoids, including increased epoxides 12(13)-EpODE, 12(13)-EpOME, 13-oxo-ODE, 15-HEPE, 20-COOH-LTB4 and decreases several diols 15,6-DiHODE, 12,13-DiHOME, 14,15-DiHETrE, 5,6-DiHETrE and 16,17-DiHDPE. Overall the inhibition of sEH in the rheumatoid arthritis model enhanced epoxides generally considered anti-inflammatory or resolutive mediators and decreased several diols with inflammatory features. These findings support the hypothesis that inhibiting the sEH increases systemic EpFA levels, advancing the understanding of the impact of these lipid mediators as therapeutical targets.

Abstract: Sphingolipids exert important roles within the cardiovascular system and related diseases. Perturbed sphingolipid metabolism was previously reported in cerebral and renal tissues of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Specific defects related to the synthesis of sphingolipids and to the metabolism of Sphingosine-1-Phospahte (S1P) were exclusively identified in the stroke-prone (SHRSP) with the respect to the stroke-resistant (SHRSR) strain. In this study, we explored any existing perturbation in either protein or gene expression of enzymes involved in the sphingolipid pathways in cardiac tissue from both SHRSP and SHRSR strains, compared to the normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) strain. The two hypertensive rat models showed an overall perturbation of the expression of different enzymes involved in the sphingolipid metabolism in the heart. In particular, whereas the expression of the S1P-metabolizing-enzyme, SPHK2, was significantly reduced in both SHR strains, SGPL1 protein levels were decreased only in SHRSP. The protein levels of S1P receptors 1–3 were reduced only in the cardiac tissue of SHRSP, whereas S1PR2 levels were reduced in both SHR strains. The de novo synthesis of sphingolipids was aberrant in the two hypertensive strains. A significant reduction of mRNA expression of the Sgms1 and Smpd3 enzymes, implicated in the metabolism of sphingomyelin, was found in both hypertensive strains. Interestingly, Smpd2, devoted to sphingomyelin degradation, was reduced only in the heart of SHRSP. In conclusion, alterations in the expression of sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes may be involved in the susceptibility to cardiac damage of hypertensive rat strains. Specific differences detected in the SHRSP, however, deserve further elucidation.

Abstract: LGALS12, also known as galectin12, belongs to the galectin family with β-galactoside-binding activity. We previously reported that LGALS12 is an important regulator of adipogenesis in porcine adipocytes in vitro, but its value in pig breeding needed to be explored in vivo. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to construct porcine fetal fibroblasts (PFFs) with a 43 bp deletion in LGALS12 exon 2. Using these PFFs as donor cells, a LGALS12 knockout pig model was generated via somatic cell nuclear transfer. Primary cultures of porcine intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) adipocytes were established using cells from LGALS12 knockout pigs and wild-type pigs. A comparison of these cells proved that LGALS12 deficiency suppresses cell proliferation via the RAS-p38MAPK pathway and promotes lipolysis via the PKA pathway in both IM and SC adipocytes. In addition, we observed AKT activation only in IM adipocytes and suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin only in SC adipocytes. Our findings suggest that LGALS12 deficiency affects the adipogenesis of IM and SC adipocytes through different mechanisms.

Abstract: The disruption of the diurnal rhythm has been recognized as a significant contributing factor to metabolic dysregulation. The important role of gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism has attracted extensive attention. However, the function of the gut microbiota-bile acid axis in regulating the diurnal rhythms of metabolic homeostasis remains largely unknown. Herein, we aimed to investigate the interplay between rhythmicity of host metabolism and gut microbiota-bile acid axis, as well as to assess the impact of obesity on them. We found that high fat diet feeding and Leptin gene deficiency (ob/ob) significantly disturbed the rhythmic patterns of insulin sensitivity and serum total cholesterol levels. The bile acid profiling unveiled a conspicuous diurnal rhythm oscillation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in lean mice, concomitant with fluctuations in insulin sensitivity, whereas it was absent in obese mice. The aforementioned diurnal rhythm oscillations were largely desynchronized by gut microbiota depletion, suggesting the indispensable role of gut microbiota in diurnal regulation of insulin sensitivity and bile acid metabolism. Consistently, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that UDCA-associated bacteria exhibited diurnal rhythm oscillations that paralleled the fluctuation in insulin sensitivity. Collectively, the current study provides compelling evidence regarding the association between diurnal rhythm of insulin sensitivity and gut microbiota-bile acid axis. Moreover, we have elucidated the deleterious effects of obesity on gut microbiome-bile acid metabolism in both the genetic obesity model and the diet-induced obesity model.

Abstract: ANGPTL8, expressed mainly in the liver and adipose tissue, regulates the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) present in the extracellular space and triglyceride (TG) metabolism through its interaction with ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4. Whether intracellular ANGPTL8 can also exert effects in tissues where it is expressed is uncertain. ANGPTL8 expression was low in preadipocytes and much increased during differentiation. To better understand the role of intracellular ANGPTL8 in adipocytes and assess whether it may play a role in adipocyte differentiation, we knocked down its expression in normal mouse subcutaneous preadipocytes. ANGPTL8 knockdown reduced adipocyte differentiation, cellular TG accumulation and also isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis at day 7 of differentiation. RNA-Seq analysis of ANGPTL8 siRNA or control siRNA transfected SC preadipocytes on days 0, 2, 4 and 7 of differentiation showed that ANGPTL8 knockdown impeded the early (day 2) expression of adipogenic and insulin signaling genes, PPARγ, as well as genes related to extracellular matrix and NF-κB signaling. Insulin mediated Akt phosphorylation was reduced at an early stage during adipocyte differentiation. This study based on normal primary cells shows that ANGPTL8 has intracellular actions in addition to effects in the extracellular space, like modulating LPL activity. Preadipocyte ANGPTL8 expression modulates their differentiation possibly via changes in insulin signaling gene expression.

Abstract: Inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks) are enzymes that catalyse the synthesis of the inositol pyrophosphate 5-IP7 which is involved in the regulation of many physiological processes in mammals. The IP6K paralog IP6K1 is expressed at high levels in the mammalian testis, and its deletion leads to sterility in male mice. Here, we show that the loss of IP6K1 in mice causes a delay in the first wave of spermatogenesis. Testes from juvenile Ip6k1 knockout mice show downregulation of transcripts that are involved in cell adhesion and formation of the testis-specific inter-Sertoli cell impermeable junction complex known as the blood-testis barrier (BTB). We demonstrate that loss of IP6K1 in the mouse testis causes BTB disruption associated with transcriptional misregulation of the tight junction protein claudin 3, and subcellular mislocalization of the gap junction protein connexin 43. In addition to BTB disruption, we also observe a loss of germ cell adhesion in the seminiferous epithelium of Ip6k1 knockout mice, ultimately resulting in premature sloughing of round spermatids into the epididymis. Mechanistically, we show that loss of IP6K1 in the testis enhances cofilin dephosphorylation in conjunction with increased AKT/ERK and integrin signalling, resulting in destabilization of the actin-based cytoskeleton in Sertoli cells and germ cell loss.

Abstract: Heterozygous germline variants in ATP1A1, the gene encoding the α1 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), have been linked to diseases including primary hyperaldosteronism and the peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). ATP1A1 variants that cause CMT induce loss-of-function of NKA. This heterodimeric (αβ) enzyme hydrolyzes ATP to establish transmembrane electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ that are essential for electrical signaling and cell survival. Of the 4 catalytic subunit isoforms, α1 is ubiquitously expressed and is the predominant paralog in peripheral axons. Human population sequencing datasets indicate strong negative selection against both missense and protein-null ATP1A1 variants. To test whether haploinsufficiency generated by heterozygous protein-null alleles are sufficient to cause disease, we tested the neuromuscular characteristics of heterozygous Atp1a1+/− knockout mice and their wildtype littermates, while also evaluating if exercise increased CMT penetrance. We found that Atp1a1+/− mice were phenotypically normal up to 18 months of age. Consistent with the observations in mice, we report clinical phenotyping of a healthy adult human who lacks any clinical features of known ATP1A1-related diseases despite carrying a plasma-membrane protein-null early truncation variant, p.Y148*. Taken together, these results suggest that a malfunctioning gene product is required for disease induction by ATP1A1 variants and that if any pathology is associated with protein-null variants, they may display low penetrance or high age of onset.

Abstract: Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) plays an indispensable regulatory part in the development and malignant progression of multifarious tumors. Nevertheless, the function of protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 1 (PP4R1), a vital regulatory subunit of PP4, in tumors especially in lung cancer remains blurred. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of PP4R1 in the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We analyzed the clinical correlation of PP4R1 based on the TCGA database by UALCAN (https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/index.html) and found that hyper-expression of PP4R1 mRNA was related to the severe prognosis in NSCLC. The subsequent cellular experiments confirmed that the proliferation, colony growth, migration as well as invasion of H1299 and HCC827 were significantly enhanced after PP4R1 overexpression treatment in vitro. Results from animal experiments pointed out that tumors exhibited stronger growth and lung metastatic capacities due to the overexpression of PP4R1. The bioinformatics analysis, including RNA-seq, showed us that PP4R1 significantly promoted the expression of several HSP70 family member genes, with a particularly marked increase in HSPA6, and the enrichment analyses illustrated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in those pathways related to protein folding. More importantly, the overexpression of HSPA6 resulted in the same malignant progression of NSCLC as PP4R1 overexpression, and both concomitant with the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In aggregate, PP4R1 contributed to the malignant progression of NSCLC via up-regulating HSPA6 expression and then activating ER stress.

Abstract: Sea cucumber phospholipids, including the plasmalogen (PlsEtn) and plasmanylcholine (PakCho), have been shown to play a regulatory role in lipid metabolism disorders, but their mechanism of action remains unclear. Therefore, high-fat diet (HFD) and palmitic acid were used to establish lipid accumulation models in mice and HepG2 cells, respectively. Results showed that PlsEtn can reduce lipid deposition both in vivo and in vitro. HFD stimulation abnormally activated lipophagy through the phosphorylation of the AMPK/ULK1 pathway. The lipophagy flux monitor revealed abnormalities in the fusion stage of lipophagy. Of note, only PlsEtn stimulated the dynamic remodeling of the autophagosome membrane, which was indicated by the significantly decreased LC3 II/I ratio and p62 level. In all experiments, the effect of PlsEtn was significantly higher than that of PakCho. These findings elucidated the mechanism of PlsEtn in alleviating lipid accumulation, showed that it might be a lipophagy enhancer, and provided new insights into the high-value utilization of sea cucumber as an agricultural resource.

Abstract: Gram-negative bacteria possess an asymmetric outer membrane (OM) primarily composed of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the outer leaflet and phospholipids on the inner leaflet. The outer membrane functions as an effective permeability barrier to compounds such as antibiotics. Studying LPS biosynthesis is therefore helpful to explore novel strategies for new antibiotic development. Metabolic glycan labeling of the bacterial surface has emerged as a powerful method to investigate LPS biosynthesis. However, the previously reported methods of labeling LPS are based on radioactivity or difficult-to-produce analogs of bacterial sugars. In this study, we report on the incorporation of azido galactose into the LPS of the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi via metabolic labeling. As a common sugar analog, azido galactose successfully labeled both O-antigen and core of Salmonella LPS, but not E. coli LPS. This labeling of Salmonella LPS, as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis and fluorescence microscopy, differs from the previously reported labeling of either O-antigen or core of LPS. Our findings are useful for studying LPS biogenesis pathways in Gram-negative bacteria like Salmonella. In addition, our approach is helpful for screening for agents that target LPS biosynthesis as it allows for the detection of newly synthesized LPS that appears in the OM. Furthermore, this approach may also aid in isolating chemically modified LPS for vaccine development or immunotherapy.

Abstract: Phosphoinositides are phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol, a phospholipid that is synthesised at the endoplasmic reticulum. The plasma membrane contains the enzymes to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol and is therefore rich in the phosphorylated derivatives, PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. PI(4,5)P2 is a substrate for phospholipase C and during cell signaling, PI(4,5)P2 levels are reduced. Here I discuss a family of proteins, phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) that can restore PI(4,5)P2 levels.

Abstract: In this study, we utilized enzyme-catalyzed proximity labeling with the engineered promiscuous biotin ligase Turbo-ID to identify the proxisome of the ROMK2 channel. This channel resides in various cellular membrane compartments of the cell including the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Within mitochondria, ROMK2 has been suggested as a pore-forming subunit of mitochondrial ATP-regulated potassium channel (mitoKATP). We found that ROMK2 proxisome in addition to previously known protein partners included two lipid kinases: acylglycerol kinase (AGK) and diacylglycerol kinase ε (DGKE), which are localized in mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Through co-immunoprecipitation, we confirmed that these two kinases are present in complexes with ROMK2 channels. Additionally, we found that the products of AGK and DGKE, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and phosphatidic acid (PA), stimulated the activity of ROMK2 channels in artificial lipid bilayers. Our molecular docking studies revealed the presence of acidic lipid binding sites in the ROMK2 channel, similar to those previously identified in Kir2 channels. Based on these findings, we propose a model wherein localized lipid synthesis, mediated by channel-bound lipid kinases, contributes to the regulation of ROMK2 activity within distinct intracellular compartments, such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.

Abstract: Tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) correlates the neoplastic cell metastasis, angiogenesis, neoplastic incursion, and apoptosis. Due to the involvement of EGFR in these biological processes, it becomes a most potent target for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have endorsed high efficacy and anticipation to patients but unfortunately, within a year of treatment, drug targets develop resistance due to mutations. The present study detected the compensatory mutations in EGFR to know the evolutionary mechanism of drug resistance. The results of this study demonstrate that compensatory mutations enlarge the drug-binding pocket which may lead to the altered orientation of the ligand (gefitinib and erlotinib) causing drug resistance. This indicates that coevolutionary forces play a significant role in fine-tuning the structure of EGFR protein against the drugs. The analysis provides insight into the evolution-induced structural aspects of drug resistance changes in EGFR which in turn be useful in designing drugs with better efficacy.

Abstract: In eukaryotes, the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids (SLs) consists of multiple sequential steps which are compartmentalized between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Studies over many decades have identified the enzymes in the pathway, their localization, topology and an array of regulatory mechanisms. However, little is known about the evolutionary forces that underly the generation of this complex pathway or of its anteome, i.e., the metabolic pathways that converge on the SL biosynthetic pathway and are essential for its activity. After briefly describing the pathway, we discuss the mechanisms by which the enzymes of the SL biosynthetic pathway are targeted to their different subcellular locations, how the pathway per se may have evolved, including its compartmentalization, and the relationship of the pathway to eukaryogenesis. We discuss the circular interdependence of the evolution of the SL pathway, and comment on whether current Darwinian evolutionary models are able to provide genuine mechanistic insight into how the pathway came into being.

Abstract: Objective
Individuals with higher intrinsic cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) experience decreased rates of cardiometabolic disease and mortality, and high CRF is associated with increased utilization of fatty acids (FAs) for energy. Studies suggest a complex relationship between CRF, diet, and sex with health outcomes, but this interaction is understudied. We hypothesized that FA utilization differences by fitness and sex could be detected in the plasma metabolome when rats or humans were fed a high carbohydrate (HC) or high fat (HF) diet.
Methods
Male and female rats selectively bred for low (LCR) and high (HCR) CRF were fed a chow diet or a sucrose-free HF (45 % fat) or HC (10 % fat) diet. Plasma samples were collected at days 0, 3, and 14. Human plasma data was collected from male and female participants who were randomized into a HC or HF diet for 21 days. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and regression statistics were used to quantify the effect of diet, CRF, and sex on the lipidome.
Results
In rats, the baseline lipidome is more significantly influenced by sex than by CRF, especially as elevated diglycerides, triglycerides, phosphatidylcholines, and lysophosphatidylcholines in males. A dynamic response to diet was observed 3 days after diet, but after 14 days of either diet, the lipidome was modulated by sex with a larger effect size than by diet. Data from the human study also suggests a sex-dependent response to diet with opposite directionality of affect compared to rats, highlighting species-dependent responses to dietary intervention.

Abstract: HAX1 is a multifunctional protein involved in the antagonism of apoptosis in cellular response to oxidative stress. In the present study we identified HAX1 as a novel binding partner for Che-1/AATF, a pro-survival factor which plays a crucial role in fundamental processes, including response to multiple stresses and apoptosis. HAX1 and Che-1 proteins show extensive colocalization in mitochondria and we demonstrated that their association is strengthened after oxidative stress stimuli. Interestingly, in MCF-7 cells, resembling luminal estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer, we found that Che-1 depletion correlates with decreased HAX1 mRNA and protein levels, and this event is not significantly affected by oxidative stress induction. Furthermore, we observed an enhancement of the previously reported interaction between HAX1 and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) upon H2O2 treatment. These results indicate the two anti-apoptotic proteins HAX1 and Che-1 as coordinated players in cellular response to oxidative stress with a potential role in estrogen sensitive breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Aim
Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a rare neurometabolic disorder that mainly affects brain, eye and skin and is caused by deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase. Our recent finding of a profoundly disturbed brain tissue lipidome in SLS prompted us to search for similar biomarkers in plasma as no functional test in blood is available for SLS.
Methods and results
We performed plasma lipidomics and used a newly developed bioinformatics tool to mine the untargeted part of the SLS plasma and brain lipidome to search for SLS biomarkers. Plasma lipidomics showed disturbed ether lipid metabolism in known lipid classes. Untargeted lipidomics of both plasma and brain (white and grey matter) uncovered two new endogenous lipid classes highly elevated in SLS. The first biomarker group were alkylphosphocholines/ethanolamines containing different lengths of alkyl-chains where some alkylphosphocholines were > 600-fold elevated in SLS plasma. The second group of biomarkers were a set of 5 features of unknown structure. Fragmentation studies suggested that they contain ubiquinol and phosphocholine and one feature was also found as a glucuronide conjugate in plasma. The plasma features were highly distinctive for SLS with levels >100–1000-fold the level in controls, if present at all. We speculate on the origin of the alkylphosphocholines/ethanolamines and the nature of the ubiquinol-containing metabolites.
Conclusions
The metabolites identified in this study represent novel endogenous lipid classes thus far unknown in humans. They represent the first plasma metabolite SLS-biomarkers and may also yield more insight into SLS pathophysiology.

Abstract: Rhodnius prolixus is a hematophagous insect, which feeds on large and infrequent blood meals, and is a vector of trypanosomatids that cause Chagas disease. After feeding, lipids derived from blood meal are stored in the fat body as triacylglycerol, which is recruited under conditions of energy demand by lipolysis, where the first step is catalyzed by the Brummer lipase (Bmm), whose orthologue in mammals is the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Here, we investigated the roles of Bmm in adult Rhodnius prolixus under starvation, and after feeding. Its gene (RhoprBmm) was expressed in all the analyzed insect organs, and its transcript levels in the fat body were not altered by nutritional status. RNAi-mediated knockdown of RhoprBmm caused triacylglycerol retention in the fat body during starvation, resulting in larger lipid droplets and lower ATP levels compared to control females. The silenced females showed decreased flight capacity and locomotor activity. When RhoprBmm knockdown occurred before the blood meal and the insects were fed, the females laid fewer eggs, which collapsed and showed low hatching rates. Their hemolymph had reduced diacylglycerol content and vitellogenin concentration. The chorion (eggshell) of their eggs had no difference in hydrocarbon amounts or in dityrosine crosslinking levels compared to control eggs. However, it showed ultrastructural defects. These results demonstrated that Bmm activity is important not only to guarantee lipid mobilization to maintain energy homeostasis during starvation, but also for the production of viable eggs after a blood meal, by somehow contributing to the right formation of the egg chorion.

Abstract: Thermogenic activation via trans-and de novo browning of white adipocytes is a promising strategy to accelerate lipid metabolism for regulating obesity-related disorders. In this study, we investigated the intricate interplay between angiogenic regulation and browning in white adipocytes using the bioactive compound, resveratrol (Rsv). Rsv has previously been documented for its regulatory influence on the trans and de novo browning of white adipocytes. Our findings revealed that concurrent activation of angiogenesis is prerequisite for inducing browning within the microenvironment of white adipocytes when exposed to browning activators. Additionally, we observed a significant browning effect on white adipocytes when the local adipose tissue environment was prompted to undergo angiogenesis, notably facilitated by a proangiogenic molecule known as Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Intriguingly, this effect was reversed when angiogenesis was inhibited by treatment with the antiangiogenic agent thalidomide. Furthermore, the study revealed the role of VEGF in paracrine activation of white adipocytes resulting in the induction of browning in both 3T3-L1 cell lines and primary mouse white adipocytes. The cross-talk between angiogenesis and browning was found to be initiated via the transcriptional activation of Estrogen receptor α (ERα) triggering the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway leading to browning and a reconfiguration of lipid metabolism within adipocytes. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the intricate cross-talk between angiogenesis and browning of white adipocytes. Notably, the findings underscore the reciprocal relationship between these processes, wherein inhibition of one process exerts discernible effects on the other.

Abstract: Sphingolipids are essential membrane components involved in a wide range of cellular, developmental and signaling processes. Sphingolipids are so essential that knock-out mutation often leads to lethality. In recent years, conditional or weak allele mutants as well as the broadening of the pharmacological catalog allowed to decipher sphingolipid function more precisely in a less invasive way. This review intends to provide a discussion and point of view on the function of sphingolipids with a main focus on endomembrane trafficking, Golgi-mediated protein sorting, cell polarity, cell-to-cell communication and cell signaling at the plasma membrane. While our main angle is the plant field research, we will constantly refer to and compare with the advances made in the yeast and animal field. In this review, we will emphasize the role of sphingolipids not only as a membrane component, but also as a key player at a center of homeostatic regulatory networks involving direct or indirect interaction with other lipids, proteins and ion fluxes.

Abstract: Glyceroglycolipids are the primary thylakoid membrane lipids in cyanobacteria. Their diverse bioactivities have led to extensive utilization in the biomedical industry. In this study, we elucidated the role of ERA (E. coli Ras-like protein) in augmenting glyceroglycolipid synthesis and bolstering stress resilience in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 during phosphate starvation. Notably, the ERA overexpression strain (ERA OE) outperformed the wild-type (WT) strain under phosphate-starved conditions, displaying an average 13.9 % increase in biomass over WT during the entire growth period, peaking at 0.185 g L−1 of dry cell weight on day 6. Lipidomic analysis using UHPLC-MS/MS techniques revealed that ERA OE exhibited a higher total glyceroglycolipid content compared to WT under phosphate starvation, representing a 7.95 % increase over WT and constituting a maximum of 5.07 % of dry cell weight on day 6. Transcriptomic analysis identified a significant up-regulation of the gldA gene (encoding glycerol dehydrogenase) involved in glycerolipid metabolism due to overexpression of ERA during phosphate starvation. These findings suggest a potential mechanism by which ERA regulates glyceroglycolipid synthesis through the up-regulation of GldA, thereby enhancing phosphate starvation tolerance in S. elongatus PCC 7942. Furthermore, lipidomic analysis revealed that ERA facilitated the production of glyceroglycolipid molecules containing C16:1 and C18:1 fatty acids. Additionally, ERA redirected lipid flux and promoted glyceroglycolipid accumulation while attenuating triacylglycerol production under phosphate starvation. This study represents the first demonstration of pivotal role of ERA in enhancing glyceroglycolipid synthesis and phosphate starvation tolerance in cyanobacteria, offering new insights into the effective utilization of glyceroglycolipids in various applications.

Abstract: In the oleaginous fungus Mucor circinelloides, lipid accumulation is regulated by nitrogen metabolism, which is regulated by the areA gene, a member of the GATA zinc finger transporter family and a major regulator for nitrogen metabolism. However, the role of areA in lipid accumulation in this fungus has not been reported. In order to explore the regulatory effect of areA gene on nitrogen metabolism and lipid accumulation in M. circinelloides, we constructed areA gene knockout and overexpression strains. Then, the recombinant strains were cultured and their biochemical indexes were measured. Simultaneously, transcriptomic studies on the recombinant strains were conducted to infer the regulatory mechanism of areA. The results showed that the areA knockout strain accumulated more lipid, which is 42 % higher than the control. While the areA overexpressing strain obtained the higher biomass accumulation (23 g/L) and used up the nitrogen source in the medium earlier than the control strain and knockout strain. Transcriptome data analysis showed that nr and nit-6 genes related to nitrogen metabolism were up-regulated. And the expression levels of key genes acc and aclY were higher in the areA knockout strain than others, which was positively correlated with the increased lipid accumulation. In addition, in knockout strains, protein catabolism tended to provide substrates for the lipid production, and the expression levels of the related genes were also higher than others. These results indicated that the areA gene not only controls the transcription level of genes related to nitrogen metabolism but also affects lipid accumulation.

Abstract: Cyclic AMP is produced in cells by two different types of adenylyl cyclases: at the plasma membrane by the transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs, ADCY1~ADCY9) and in the cytosol by the evolutionarily more conserved soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC, ADCY10). By employing high-resolution extracellular flux analysis in HepG2 cells to study glycogen breakdown in real time, we showed that cAMP regulates glycogen metabolism in opposite directions depending on its location of synthesis within cells and the downstream cAMP effectors. While the canonical tmAC-cAMP-PKA signaling promotes glycogenolysis, we demonstrate here that the non-canonical sAC-cAMP-Epac1 signaling suppresses glycogenolysis. Mechanistically, suppression of sAC-cAMP-Epac1 leads to Ser-15 phosphorylation and thereby activation of the liver-form glycogen phosphorylase to promote glycogenolysis. Our findings highlight the importance of cAMP microdomain organization for distinct metabolic regulation and establish sAC as a novel regulator of glycogen metabolism.

Abstract: Hyaluronan is an important extracellular matrix component, with poorly documented physiological role in the context of lipid-rich adipose tissue. We have investigated the global impact of hyaluronan removal from adipose tissue environment by in vitro exposure to exogenous hyaluronidase (or heat inactivated enzyme). Gene set expression analysis from RNA sequencing revealed downregulated adipogenesis as a main response to hyaluronan removal from human adipose tissue samples, which was confirmed by hyaluronidase-mediated inhibition of adipocyte differentiation in the 3T3L1 adipose cell line. Hyaluronidase exposure starting from the time of induction with the differentiation cocktail reduced lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes, limited the expression of terminal differentiation marker genes, and impaired the early induction of co-regulated Cebpa and Pparg mRNA. Reduction of Cebpa and Pparg expression by exogenous hyaluronidase was also observed in cultured primary preadipocytes from subcutaneous, visceral or brown adipose tissue of mice. Mechanistically, inhibition of adipogenesis by hyaluronan removal was not caused by changes in osmotic pressure or cell inflammatory status, could not be mimicked by exposure to threose, a metabolite generated by hyaluronan degradation, and was not linked to alteration in endogenous Wnt ligands expression. Rather, we observed that hyaluronan removal associated with disrupted primary cilia dynamics, with elongated cilium and higher proportions of preadipocytes that remained ciliated in hyaluronidase-treated conditions. Thus, our study points to a new link between ciliogenesis and hyaluronan impacting adipose tissue development.

Abstract: Background
The landscape of specific peripheral circulating immune cell subsets at the single-cell level in the occurrence and development of coronary artery disease (CAD) remains poorly understood.
Methods
We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from subjects with CAD (n = 3), and controls (n = 3), as well as downstream analysis including cell- and gene-level approaches. This explored the characteristics of peripheral circulating immune cells between CADs and controls by means of Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), Monocle3 package, CellPhoneDB, and single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC). PBMCs were used as clinical samples for validating our findings by qRT-PCR.
Results
We identified 33 cell clusters among 67,447 cells, including monocytes, T cells, B cells, NK cells, and platelets. The significant difference in the abundance of the 33 clusters of cell type between CADs group and controls group was not found. The JUN was shared in cluster 0, 11,13, and 24 from differential expression genes analysis and SCENIC analysis in monocyte clusters between CAD and controls. Besides, JUN was validated to be significantly upregulated in the CAD group (p = 0.018) and may act as a potential diagnostic biomarker and independent predictor of CAD.
Conclusions
Our study offered a detailed profiling of single-cell RNA sequencing of PBMCs from subjects with CADs and controls. These data provide a line of evidence that the JUN signaling pathway may be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic molecule target for CAD.

Abstract: This work aims to understand better the mechanism of cellular processes accompanying the activation of human T cells and to develop a novel, fast, label-free approach to identify molecular biomarkers for this process. The standard methodology for confirming the activation state of T cells is based on flow cytometry and using antibodies recognizing activation markers. The method provide high specificity detection but may be susceptible to background staining or non-specific secondary antibody reactions. Here, we evaluated the potential of Raman-based molecular imaging in distinguishing non-activated and activated human T cells. Confocal Raman microscopy was performed on T cells followed by chemometrics to obtain comprehensive molecular information, while Stimulated Raman Scattering imaging was used to quickly provide high-resolution images of selected cellular components of activated and non-activated cells. For the first time, carotenoids, lipids, and proteins were shown to be important biomarkers of T-cell activation. We found that T-cell activation was accompanied by lipid accumulation and loss of carotenoid content. Our findings on the biochemical, morphological, and structural changes associated with activated mature T cells provide insights into the molecular changes that occur during therapeutic manipulation of the immune response. The methodology for identifying activated T cells is based on a novel imaging method and supervised and unsupervised chemometrics. It unambiguously identifies specific and unique molecular changes without the need for staining, fixation, or any other sample preparation.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane receptors that respond to external stimuli and undergo conformational changes to activate G proteins and modulate cellular processes leading to biological outcomes. To prevent overstimulation and prolonged exposure to stimuli, GPCRs are regulated by internalization. While the canonical GPCR internalization mechanism in mammalian cells is arrestin-dependent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, more diverse GPCR internalization mechanisms have been described over the years. However, there is a lack of consistent methods used in the literature making it complicated to determine a receptor's internalization pathway. Here, we utilized a highly efficient time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) internalization assay to determine the internalization profile of nine distinct GPCRs representing the GPCR classes A, B and C and with different G protein coupling profiles. This technique, coupled with clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineered knockout cells allows us to effectively study the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins and non-visual arrestins. We found that all the nine receptors internalized upon agonist stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner and six receptors showed basal internalization. Yet, there is no correlation between the receptor class and primary G protein coupling to the arrestin and G protein dependence for GPCR internalization. Overall, this study presents a platform for studying internalization that is applicable to most GPCRs and may even be extended to other membrane proteins. This method can be easily applicable to other endocytic machinery of interest and ultimately will lend itself towards the construction of comprehensive receptor internalization profiles.

Abstract: The Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 is responsible for the formation of the viral matrix by localizing at the inner leaflet of the human plasma membrane (PM). Various lipid types, including PI(4,5)P2 (i.e. PIP2) and phosphatidylserine (PS), play active roles in this process. Specifically, the negatively charged headgroups of both PIP2 and PS interact with the basic residues of VP40 and stabilize it at the membrane surface, allowing for eventual egress. Phosphatidic acid (PA), resulting from the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD), is also known to play an active role in viral development. In this work, we performed a biophysical and computational analysis to investigate the effects of the presence of PA on the membrane localization and association of VP40. We used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to quantify VP40 hexamer interactions with the inner leaflet of the PM. Analysis of the local distribution of lipids shows enhanced lipid clustering when PA is abundant in the membrane. We observed that PA lipids have a similar role to that of PS lipids in VP40 association due to the geometry and charge. Complementary experiments performed in cell culture demonstrate competition between VP40 and a canonical PA-binding protein for the PM. Also, inhibition of PA synthesis reduced the detectable budding of virus-like particles. These computational and experimental results provide new insights into the early stages of Ebola virus budding and the role that PA lipids have on the VP40-PM association.

Abstract: The present work reports the detection and cloning of a new CYP74 clan gene of the European lancelet (Branchiostoma lanceolatum) and the biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein CYP440A19. CYP440A19 possessed epoxyalcohol synthase (EAS) activity towards the 13-hydroperoxides of linoleic and α-linolenic acids, which were converted into oxiranylcarbinols, i.e., (11S,12R,13S)-11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy derivatives. The conversion of 9-hydroperoxides produced distinct products. Linoleic acid 9(S)-hydroperoxide (9-HPOD) was mainly converted into 9,14-diol (10E,12E)-9,14-dihydroxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid and macrolactone 9(S),10(R)-epoxy-11(E)-octadecen-13(S)-olide. In addition, (8Z)-colneleic acid was formed. Brief incubations of the enzyme with 9-HPOD in a biphasic system of hexane–water enabled the isolation of the short-lived 9,10-epoxydiene (9S,10R,11E,13E)-9,10-epoxy-11,13-octadecadienoic acid. The structure and stereochemistry of the epoxyalcohols, macrolactone, (8Z)-colneleic acid (Me), and 9,10-epoxydiene (Me) were confirmed by 1H-NMR, 1H-1H-COSY, 1H-13C-HSQC, and 1H-13C-HMBC spectroscopy. Macrolactone and cis-9,10-epoxydiene are novel products. The 9-hydroperoxide of α-linolenic acid was mainly converted into macrolactone 9(S),10(R)-epoxy-11(E),15(Z)-octadecadiene-13(S)-olide and a minority of divinyl ethers, particularly (8Z)-colnelenic acid. The versatility of enzyme catalysis, as well as the diversity of CYP74s and other enzymes involved in oxylipin biosynthesis, demonstrates the complexity of the lipoxygenase pathway in lancelets.

Abstract: Lipid biosynthesis is a significant metabolic response to nitrogen starvation in oleaginous fungi. The oleaginous fungus Mucor circinelloides copes with nitrogen stress by degrading AMP through AMP deaminase (AMPD). However, the mechanism of AMPD in regulating lipogenesis remains largely unclear. To elucidate the mechanism of AMPD in lipid synthesis in this M. circinelloides, we identified two genes (ampd1 and ampd2) encoding AMPD and constructed an ampd double knockout mutant. The engineered M. circinelloides strain elevated cell growth and lipid accumulation, as well as the content of oleic acid (OA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). In addition to the expected increase in transcription levels of genes associated with lipid and TAG synthesis, we observed suppression of lipid degradation and reduced amino acid biosynthesis. This suggested that the deletion of AMPD genes induces the redirection of carbon towards lipid synthesis pathways. Moreover, the pathways related to nitrogen metabolism, including nitrogen assimilation and purine metabolism (especially energy level), were also affected in order to maintain homeostasis. Further analysis discovered that the transcription factors (TFs) related to lipid accumulation were also regulated. This study provides new insights into lipid biosynthesis in M. circinelloides, indicating that the trigger for lipid accumulation is not entirely AMPD-dependent and suggest that there may be additional mechanisms involved in the initiation of lipogenesis.

Abstract: Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are degraded exclusively in peroxisomes, as evidenced by the accumulation of VLCFAs in patients with certain peroxisomal disorders. Although accumulation of VLCFAs is considered to be associated with health issues, including neuronal degeneration, the mechanisms underlying VLCFAs-induced tissue degeneration remain unclear. Here, we report the toxic effect of VLCFA and protective effect of C18: 1 FA in peroxisome-deficient CHO cells. We examined the cytotoxicity of saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs with chain-length at C20–C26, and found that longer and saturated VLCFA showed potent cytotoxicity at lower accumulation levels. Furthermore, the extent of VLCFA-induced toxicity was found to be associated with a decrease in cellular C18:1 FA levels. Notably, supplementation with C18:1 FA effectively rescued the cells from VLCFA-induced apoptosis without reducing the cellular VLCFAs levels, implying that peroxisome-deficient cells can survive in the presence of accumulated VLCFA, as long as the cells keep sufficient levels of cellular C18:1 FA. These results suggest a therapeutic potential of C18:1 FA in peroxisome disease and may provide new insights into the pharmacological effect of Lorenzo's oil, a 4:1 mixture of C18:1 and C22:1 FA.

Abstract: Antibiotic resistance has led to an increase in the number of patient hospitalizations and deaths. The situation for gram-negative bacteria is especially dire as the last new class of antibiotics active against these bacteria was introduced to the clinic over 60 years ago, thus there is an immediate unmet need for new antibiotic classes able to overcome resistance. The outer membrane, a unique and essential structure in gram-negative bacteria, contains multiple potential antibacterial targets including BamA, an outer membrane protein that folds and inserts transmembrane β-barrel proteins. BamA is essential and conserved, and its outer membrane location eliminates a barrier that molecules must overcome to access this target. Recently, antibacterial small molecules, natural products, peptides, and antibodies that inhibit BamA activity have been reported, validating the druggability of this target and generating potential leads for antibiotic development. This review will describe these BamA inhibitors, highlight their key attributes, and identify challenges with this potential target.

Abstract: Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing proteins (PNPLAs) play diverse roles in lipid metabolism. In this review, we focus on the enzymatic properties and predicted 3D structures of PNPLA1-5. PNPLA2-4 exert both catabolic and anabolic functions. Whereas PNPLA1 is predominantly expressed in the epidermis and involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis, PNPLA2 and 4 are ubiquitously expressed and exhibit several enzymatic activities, including hydrolysis and transacylation of various (glycero-)lipid species. This review summarizes known biological roles for PNPLA-mediated hydrolysis and transacylation reactions and highlights open questions concerning their physiological function.

Abstract: Radiotherapy is one of the most commonly used cancer therapies with many benefits including low toxicity to healthy tissues. However, a major problem in radiotherapy is cancer radioresistance. To enhance the effect of this kind of therapy several approaches have been proposed such as the use of radiosensitizers. A combined treatment of radiotherapy and radiosensitizing drugs leads to a greater effect on cancer cells than anticipated from the addition of both responses (synergism). In this study, high-definition FT-IR imaging was applied to follow lipid accumulation in prostate cancer cells as a response to X-ray irradiation, radiosensitizing drugs, and a combined treatment of X-rays and the drugs. Lipid accumulation induced in the cells by an increasing X-ray dose and the presence of the drugs was analyzed using Principal Component Analysis and lipid staining. Finally, the synergistic effect of the combined therapy (X-rays and radiosensitizers) was confirmed by calculations of the integral intensity of the 2850 cm−1 band.

Abstract: Hepatic inflammation is commonly identified in Wilson disease (WD), a genetic disease of hepatic and brain copper accumulation. Copper accumulation is associated with increased oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species generation which may result in non-enzymatic oxidation of membrane-bound polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). PUFA can be oxidized enzymatically via lipoxygenases (LOX), cyclooxygenases (COX), and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP). Products of PUFA oxidation are collectively known as oxylipins (OXL) and are bioactive lipids that modulate hepatic inflammation. We examined hepatic OXL profiles at early stages of WD in two mouse models, the toxic milk mouse from The Jackson Laboratory (tx-j) and the Atp7b knockout on a C57Bl/6 background (Atp7b−/−B6). Targeted lipidomic analysis performed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry showed that in both tx-j and Atp7b−/−B6 mice, hepatic OXL profiles were altered with higher thromboxane and prostaglandins levels. The levels of oxidative stress marker, 9-HETE were increased more markedly in tx-j mice. However, both genotypes showed upregulated transcript levels of many genes related to oxidative stress and inflammation. Both genotypes showed higher prostaglandins, thromboxin along with higher PUFA-derived alcohols, diols, and ketones with altered epoxides; the expression of Alox5 was upregulated and many CYP-related genes were dysregulated. Pathway analyses show dysregulation in arachidonic acid and linoleic acid metabolism characterizes mice with WD. Our findings indicate alterations in hepatic PUFA metabolism in early-stage WD and suggest the upregulation of both, non-enzymatic ROS-dependent and enzymatic PUFA oxidation, which could have implications for hepatic manifestations in WD and represent potential targets for future therapies.

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibits abdominal fat accumulation by promoting adipocyte apoptosis through PPARγ-LC3-BNIP3 pathway-mediated mitophagy,

Abstract: Obesity has always been an overwhelming health concern worldwide. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduces abdominal fat accumulation by inducing adipocyte apoptosis, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Mitophagy, the process of maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, has a double-edged sword effect that positively or negatively regulates apoptosis. In this study, grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) was used as an animal model to investigate the role of mitophagy in regulating apoptosis and the potential molecular mechanisms for DHA-induced mitophagy in vivo and in vitro. Firstly, we found that DHA induced the intrinsic apoptosis in grass carp adipocytes, accompanying by activating BNIP3/NIX-mediated mitophagy. Then, suppression of mitophagy alleviated apoptosis and eliminated the inhibition of lipid accumulation induced by DHA in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, the DHA-induced mitophagy was caused by activating PPARγ and its DNA binding capacity to the LC3 promoter, which promoted the interaction of BNIP3 (rather than NIX) with LC3. However, the inhibition of PPARγ in vitro significantly decreased the expression of autophagy-related genes (P < 0.05), reducing the colocalization of mitochondria and lysosomes while preventing BNIP3/NIX-mediated mitophagy-mediated apoptosis and subsequently alleviating the inhibition of lipid accumulation in adipocytes induced by DHA. For the first time, we demonstrated that DHA activates mitophagy by regulating the PPARγ-LC3-BNIP3 pathway, consequently inducing apoptosis, which decreases adipocytes, inhibiting lipid accumulation in grass carp. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism of DHA-induced apoptosis mediated by mitophagy as the potential therapeutic target of inhibiting abdominal fat accumulation in vertebrates.

Abstract: Ahiflower® oil is high in α-linolenic and stearidonic acids, however, tissue/blood docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) turnover from dietary Ahiflower oil has not been investigated. In this study, we use compound-specific isotope analysis to determine tissue DHA synthesis/turnover from Ahiflower, flaxseed and DHA oils. Pregnant BALB/c mice (13–17 days) were placed on a 2 % algal DHA oil diet of high carbon-13 content (δ13C) and pups (n = 132) were maintained on the diet until 9 weeks old. Mice were then randomly allocated to a low δ13C-n-3 PUFA diet of either: 1) 4 % Ahiflower oil, 2) 4.35 % flaxseed oil or 3) 1 % fish DHA ethyl ester oil for 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 60 or 120 days (n = 6). Serum, liver, adipose and brains were collected and DHA levels and δ13C were determined. DHA concentrations were highest (p < 0.05) in the liver and adipose of DHA-fed animals with no diet differences in serum or brain (p > 0.05). Based on the presence or absence of overlapping 95 % C.I.'s, DHA half-lives and synthesis/turnover rates were not different between Ahiflower and DHA diets in the liver, adipose or brain. DHA half-lives and synthesis/turnover rates from flaxseed oil were significantly slower than from the DHA diet in all serum/tissues. These findings suggest that the distinct Ahiflower oil n-3 PUFA composition could support tissue DHA needs at a similar rate to dietary DHA, making it a unique plant-based dietary option for maintaining DHA turnover comparably to dietary DHA.

Abstract: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) exhibits a unique membrane lipid composition, including dimyristoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE) and cholesterol, unlike other Gram-negative bacteria. Calcitriol has antimicrobial activity against H. pylori, but cholesterol enhances antibiotics resistance in H. pylori. This study explored the changes in membrane structure and the molecular mechanisms of cholesterol/calcitriol translocation using well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD) simulations and microsecond conventional molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations. Calcitriol facilitated water transport across the membrane, while cholesterol had the opposite effect. The differing effects might result from the tail 25-hydroxyl group and a wider range of orientations of calcitriol in the DMPE/dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) (3:1) membrane. Calcitriol moves across the bilayer center without changing its orientation along the membrane Z-axis, becomes parallel to the membrane surface at the membrane-water interface, and then rotates approximately 90° in this interface. The translocation mechanism of calcitriol is quite different from the flip-flop of cholesterol. Moreover, calcitriol crossed from one layer to another more easily than cholesterol, causing successive perturbations to the hydrophobic core and increasing water permeation. These results improve our understanding of the relationship between cholesterol/calcitriol concentrations and the lipid bilayer structure and the role of lipid composition in water permeation.

Abstract: Studies on marine fish showed that vegetable oils substituted for excessive fish oil increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production. However, whether the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has a substantial role in fatty acid-induced IL-1β production in fish remains unclear. The associated specific mechanism is also unknown. In this study, nlrp3, caspase-1 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (asc) were successfully cloned, and NLRP3 inflammasome consisted of NLRP3, caspase-1 and ASC in large yellow croaker. Primary hepatocytes of fish incubated with palmitic acid (PA) exhibited the highest expression of pro-inflammatory genes (il-1β and tnfα) and NLRP3 inflammasome related genes (nlrp3, caspase-1 and asc), caspase-1 activity and IL-1β production among different treatments. Furthermore, PA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation was confirmed to require two signals: the first signal was that PA promoted the NF-κB (P65) protein into the nucleus, and NF-κB increased NLRP3 promoter activity and nlrp3 transcription. The second signal was that PA inhibited AMPK phosphorylation and decreased mitophagy by inhibiting the expression of PINK and parkin proteins, thereby damaging the mitochondria that could not be effectively cleared. Mitochondrial damage generated excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species, which activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and then induced caspase-1 activity and IL-1β production. Therefore, excessive dietary PA activated NLRP3 inflammasome through NF-κB and AMPK-mitophagy-ROS pathways to induce IL-1β production, thereby leading to inflammation in fish.

Abstract: Renal fibrosis is a common pathway leading to progressive renal function loss in various forms of chronic kidney disease. Many fibrogenic factors regulate renal fibrosis; two key players are post-injury inflammation and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Myofibroblast differentiation is tightly regulated by the microtubule polymerization. Noscapine, an antitussive plant alkaloid, is a potent microtubule-interfering agent previously identified as a potential anticancer compound. Here, we examined how noscapine affects renal fibrogenesis in an in vitro renal fibroblast model and an in vivo unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model. UUO mice were intraperitoneally treated with noscapine at 1 day before UUO surgery and daily thereafter. At 7 days post-surgery, kidneys were collected for further analysis. To analyze whether noscapine inhibits downstream TGF-β1-related signaling, we pre-incubated NRK-49F fibroblasts with noscapine and then performed TGF-β1 stimulation. In UUO mice, noscapine attenuated extracellular matrix protein deposition and the expression levels of type I collagen, type IV collagen, α-smooth muscle actin, and fibronectin. In addition, noscapine decreased tubulointerstitial inflammation in UUO kidneys by reducing TLR2 expression, modulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation, reducing macrophage infiltration, and antagonizing the M2 macrophage phenotype. Furthermore, noscapine pre-incubation suppressed the TGF-β1-induced fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation by downregulating the TGF-β/Smads signaling pathways in NRK-49F cells. These results suggest that noscapine reduces tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis in the kidneys of UUO mice and inhibits the fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation induced by TGF-β1. Noscapine is an over-the-counter antitussive that has been used safely for several decades. Therefore, noscapine is an attractive therapeutic agent for inhibiting renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

Abstract: Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is a challenging global issue. Although the cause is unknown, increasing evidence suggests that immunological factors play a crucial role in RSA development. Icaritin (ICT), a natural compound derived from Epimedium, has demonstrated diverse biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic role of ICT in mitigating RSA in a mouse model. Specifically, we sought to determine whether ICT could modulate the Treg/Th17 cell imbalance via the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway and contributed to improved pregnancy outcomes. We conducted experiments on a mouse model with RSA and administered ICT orally. We then examined the effects of ICT on various types of immune cells including Treg and Th17 cells, and assessed the pregnancy outcomes. We also investigated the potential signaling pathway ICT exerted its effects. Our findings revealed that treatment with ICT led to an increase in Treg cells and a decrease in Th17 cells, which restored immune homeostasis and contributed to improved pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that ICT's effects were mediated through the activation of TGF-β/SMAD signaling components. In conclusion, our study suggested that ICT ameliorated RSA by modulating Treg/Th17 cell imbalance via the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway.
General significance
Our results highlighted the potential of ICT as a novel therapeutic agent for RSA, offering new insights into the underlying mechanisms and opening avenues for future research and clinical translation.

Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B is a regulator of alpha-actinin4 in the glomerular podocyte,

Abstract: Glomerular podocytes are instrumental for the barrier function of the kidney, and podocyte injury contributes to proteinuria and the deterioration of renal function. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an established metabolic regulator, and the inactivation of this phosphatase mitigates podocyte injury. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the substrates that mediate PTP1B actions in podocytes. This study aims to uncover novel substrates of PTP1B in podocytes and validate a leading candidate. To this end, using substrate-trapping and mass spectroscopy, we identified putative substrates of this phosphatase and investigated the actin cross-linking cytoskeletal protein alpha-actinin4. PTP1B and alpha-actinin4 co-localized in murine and human glomeruli and transiently transfected E11 podocyte cells. Additionally, podocyte PTP1B deficiency in vivo and culture was associated with elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of alpha-actinin4. Conversely, reconstitution of the knockdown cells with PTP1B attenuated alpha-actinin4 tyrosine phosphorylation. We demonstrated co-association between alpha-actinin4 and the PTP1B substrate-trapping mutant, which was enhanced upon insulin stimulation and disrupted by vanadate, consistent with an enzyme-substrate interaction. Moreover, we identified alpha-actinin4 tandem tyrosine residues 486/487 as mediators of its interaction with PTP1B. Furthermore, knockdown studies in E11 cells suggest that PTP1B and alpha-actinin4 are modulators of podocyte motility. These observations indicate that PTP1B and alpha-actinin4 are likely interacting partners in a signaling node that modulates podocyte function. Targeting PTP1B and plausibly this one of its substrates may represent a new therapeutic approach for podocyte injury that warrants additional investigation.

Abstract: BRAWNIN was found as a mitochondrial respiratory complex III (CIII) assembly factor. Here, we showed that the deletion rather than knockdown of BRAWNIN impaired the assembly of CIII. BRAWNIN levels were affected by nutritional stress and negatively associated with AMPK activation. Although the BRAWNIN knockout via CRISPR/Cas9 led to decreased complex III levels, both biochemical and functional studies of oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) complexes revealed that knockdown of BRAWNIN neither affected mitochondrial respiration nor impaired the integrity of OXPHOS complexes I-V. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling further confirmed that the BRAWNIN knockdown had a minimal effect on mitochondrial function. Moreover, only a small proportion of BRAWNIN interacted with the subunits of the OXPHOS complexes, which might be difficult to detect via co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Finally, our findings also indicated that although only a minimal amount of BRAWNIN was required for CIII assembly, metabolic analyses revealed that it may fine-tune the pyruvate metabolism route in mitochondria.

Abstract: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence promotes atherosclerosis via lipid-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. However, the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and VSMC senescence in atherosclerosis have not been established. Here, we investigated the mechanisms whereby signaling pathways regulated by SRT1720 enhance or regulate mitochondrial functions in atherosclerotic VSMCs to suppress atherosclerosis. Initially, we examined the effect of SRT1720 on oleic acid (OA)-induced atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic VSMCs exhibited elevated expressions of BODIPY and ADRP (adipose differentiation-related protein) and associated intracellular lipid droplet markers. In addition, the expression of collagen I was upregulated by OA, while the expressions of elastin and α-SMA were downregulated. mtDNA copy numbers, an ATP detection assay, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of mitochondria, mitochondria membrane potentials (assessed using JC-1 probe), and levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) were used to examine the effects of SRT1720 on OA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. SRT1720 reduced mtDNA damage and accelerated mitochondria repair in VSMCs with OA-induced mitochondria dysfunction. In addition, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) levels were downregulated by SRT1720 in OA-treated VSMCs. Importantly, SRT1720 significantly increased SIRT1 and PGC-1α expression levels, but VSMCs senescence, inflammatory response, and atherosclerosis phenotypes were not recovered by treating cells with EX527 and SR-18292 before SRT1720. Mechanistically, the upregulations of SIRT1 and PGC-1α deacetylation by SRT1720 restored mitochondrial function, and consequently suppressed VSMC senescence and atherosclerosis-associated proteins and phenotypes. Collectively, this study indicates that SRT1720 can attenuate OA-induced atherosclerosis associated with VSMC senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction via SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of the PGC-1α pathway.

Abstract: Tylophora indica (Burm f.) Merrill, belong to family Asclepiadaceae, is considered to be a natural remedy with high medicinal benefits. The objective of this work is to assess the metabolomic profile of T. indica leaves enriched in alkaloids, as well as to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of these leaves using the MTT assay on human breast MCF-7 and liver HepG2 cancer cell lines. Dried leaves of T. indica were extracted by sonication, using methanol containing 2 % (v/v) of acetic acid and obtained fraction was characterized by HPTLC and UPLC-MS. The UPLC-MS study yielded a preliminary identification of 32 metabolites, with tylophorine, tylophorine B, tylophorinine, and tylophorinidine being the predominant metabolites. The cytotoxicity of the extract of T. indica was evaluated on HepG2 and MCF-7 cell lines, yielding inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 75.71 μg/mL and 69.60 μg/mL, respectively. Data suggested that the phytochemical screening clearly showed presence of numerous secondary metabolites with moderate cytotoxic efficacy. In conclusion, the future prospects of T. indica appear promising for the advancement of phytopharmaceutical-based anticancer medications, as well as for the design of contemporary pharmaceuticals in the field of cancer chemotherapy.

Abstract: Backgrounds
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases. The leaves of Broussonetia papyrifera contain a large number of flavonoids, which have a variety of biological functions.
Methods
In vitro experiments, free fatty acids were used to stimulate HepG2 cells. NAFLD model was established in vivo in mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) or intraperitoneally injected with Tyloxapol (Ty). At the same time, Total flavonoids of Broussonetia papyrifera (TFBP) was used to interfere with HepG2 cells or mice.
Results
The results showed that TFBP significantly decreased the lipid accumulation induced by oil acid (OA) with palmitic acid (PA) in HepG2 cells. TFBP decreased the total cholesterol (TC), the triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) in serum. TFBP could also effectively inhibit the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and restrained the level of myeloperoxidase (MPO), and enhance the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to alleviate the injury from oxidative stress in the liver. Additionally, TFBP activated nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway to increasing the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Meanwhile, protein levels of mTORC signaling pathway were evidently restrained with the treatment of TFBP.
Conclusion
Our experiments proved that TFBP has the therapeutic effect in NAFLD, and the activation of Nrf2 and AMPK signaling pathways should make sense.

Abstract: This study aims to explore the relationship between altered vitamin D (VitD3) status and ovarian steroidogenesis in muskrats during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. During the breeding season, the ovaries of muskrats were observably enlarged and increased in weight, accompanied by elevated serum and ovarian VitD3 status. Vitamin D receptor (VDR), VitD3 metabolic molecules (CYP2R1, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1), and steroidogenic enzymes were immunolocalized in the ovarian cells of muskrats. The mRNA levels of VDR, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, and steroidogenic enzymes were considerably higher during the breeding season compared to the non-breeding season. RNA-seq analysis revealed a prominent enrichment of vitamin-related and ovarian steroidogenesis pathways. Furthermore, the addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 to the muskrat granulosa cells in vitro increased VDR and steroidogenic enzymes mRNA levels and enhanced the 17β-estradiol level. Overall, these findings supported that VitD3 promotes the secretion of steroid hormones, thereby affecting seasonal changes in ovarian function in the muskrats.

Taste receptor type 1 member 3 regulates Western diet-induced male infertility,

Abstract: Western diet (WD), characterized by a high intake of fats and sugary drinks, is a risk factor for male reproductive impairment. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this remain unclear. Taste receptor type 1 member 3 (TAS1R3), activated by ligands of WD, is highly expressed in extra-oral tissues, particularly in the testes. Here, we investigated to determine the effects of WD intake on male reproduction and whether TAS1R3 mediates WD-induced impairment in male reproduction. Male C57BL/6 J wild-type (WT) and Tas1r3 knockout (KO) mice were fed either a normal diet and plain water (ND) or a 60 % high-fat-diet and 30 % (w/v) sucrose water (WD) for 18 weeks (n = 7–9/group). Long-term WD consumption significantly impaired sperm count, motility and testicular morphology in WT mice with marked Tas1r3 overexpression, whereas Tas1r3 KO mice were protected from WD-induced reproductive impairment. Testicular transcriptome analysis revealed downregulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and significantly elevated AMPK-targeted nuclear receptor 4A1 (Nr4a1) expression in WD-fed Tas1r3 KO mice. In vitro studies further validated that Tas1r3 knockdown in Leydig cells prevented the suppression of Nr4a1 and downstream steroidogenic genes (Star, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, and Hsd3b1) caused by high glucose, fructose, and palmitic acid levels, and maintained the levels of testosterone. Additionally, we analyzed the public human dataset to assess the clinical implications of our findings and confirmed a significant association between TAS1R3 and male-infertility-related diseases. Our findings suggest that TAS1R3 regulates WD-induced male reproductive impairment via the AMPK/NR4A1 signaling and can be a novel therapeutic target for male infertility.

Abstract: Lauric acid (LA) induces apoptosis in cancer and promotes the proliferation of normal cells by maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Earlier, we postulated LA-mediated regulation of the NF-κB pathway by an epigenetic mechanism. However, the molecular mechanism and possible epigenetic events remained enigmatic. Herein, taking the lead from the alteration in cellular energetics in cancer cells upon LA exposure, we investigated whether LA exposure can epigenetically influence lncRNA HOTAIR, regulate glucose metabolism, and shift the cellular energetic state. Our results demonstrate LA induced modulation of lncRNA HOTAIR in a dose and time dependent manner. In addition, HOTAIR induces the expression of glucose transporter isoform 1 (GLUT1) and is regulated via NF-κB activation. Silencing HOTAIR by siRNA-mediated knockdown suppressed GLUT1 expression suggesting the key role of HOTAIR in LA-mediated metabolic reprogramming. Further, from our ChIP experiments, we observed that silencing HOTAIR subdues the recruitment of NF-κB on the GLUT1 (SLC2A1) promoter region. In addition, by performing western blot and immunocytochemistry studies, we found a dose dependent increase in Histone 3 Lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) in the chromatin landscape. Taken together, our study demonstrates the epigenetic regulation in LA-treated SH-SY5Y cancer cells orchestrated by remodeling chromatin H3K4me3 and modulation of lncRNA HOTAIR that apparently governs the GLUT1 expression and regulates glucose uptake by exerting transcriptional control on NF-κB activation. Our work provides insights into the epigenetic regulation and metabolic reprogramming of LA through modulation of lncRNA HOTAIR, remodeling chromatin H3K4 tri-methylation, and shifting the energy metabolism in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.

Abstract: The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homolog (WASH) complex is a pentameric protein complex localized at endosomes, where it facilitates the transport of numerous receptors from endosomes toward the plasma membrane. Recent studies have shown that the WASH complex plays an essential role in cholesterol and glucose homeostasis in humans and mice. To investigate the physiological importance of intestinal WASH, we ablated the WASH component WASHC1 specifically in murine enterocytes. Male and female intestine-specific WASHC1-deficient mice (Washc1IKO) were challenged with either a standard chow diet or a high-cholesterol (1.25 %) diet (HCD). Washc1IKO mice fed a standard diet did not present any apparent phenotype, but when fed an HCD, their hepatic cholesterol levels were ~ 50 % lower compared to those observed in control mice. The intestinal cholesterol absorption was almost 2-fold decreased in Washc1IKO mice, which translated into increased fecal neutral sterol loss. The intestinal expression of cholesterogenic genes, such as Hmgcs1, Hmgcr, and Ldlr, was significantly higher in Washc1IKO mice than in control mice and correlated with increased whole-body de novo cholesterol synthesis, likely to compensate for impaired intestinal cholesterol absorption. Unexpectedly, the ratio of biliary 12α−/non-12α-hydroxylated bile acids (BAs) was decreased in Washc1IKO mice and reversing this reduced ratio by feeding the mice with the HCD supplemented with 0.5 % (w/w) sodium cholate normalized the improvement of hepatic cholesterol levels in Washc1IKO mice. Our data indicate that the intestinal WASH complex plays an important role in intestinal cholesterol absorption, likely by modulating biliary BA composition.

Abstract: The razor clam Sinonovacula constricta is known for its richness in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA, C ≥ 20). Previously, we demonstrated that it possesses a complete LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathway. However, the mechanisms by which it senses the LC-PUFA pool to regulate their biosynthesis remain unclear. Here, we presented the LC-PUFA sensor UBXD8 as a critical molecule in this intriguing process. The S. constricta UBXD8 (ScUBXD8) shared all characteristic features of its mammalian counterpart and exhibited high mRNA levels in digestive tissues, suggesting its functional role in this bivalve species. By purification of ScUBXD8 protein in vitro, we discovered its ability to sense unsaturated fatty acids (UFA, C ≥ 14) but not saturated ones, as evidenced by polymerization detection. Furthermore, the intensity of ScUBXD8 polymerization increased progressively with longer acyl chain lengths, greater unsaturation degrees, and higher UFA concentrations. Exceptionally, for those located at the same node in LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathway, ScUBXD8 displayed a stronger sensitivity to n-6 UFA compared to n-3 UFA. These results suggested a critical role for ScUBXD8 in balancing fatty acids composition and ratio of n-6/n-3 UFA in S. constricta. Moreover, the UAS domain was confirmed essential for ScUBXD8 polymerization. Through knockdown of ScUbxd8 gene in vivo, there were significant shifts in expression patterns of genes related to LC-PUFA biosynthesis, concurrently influencing fatty acids compositions. These results suggested that ScUBXD8 likely plays a regulatory role in LC-PUFA biosynthesis, possibly through the INSIG-SREBP pathway. Collectively, this study proposed that S. constricta might maintain LC-PUFA homeostasis through UBXD8 to regulate their biosynthesis.

Abstract: Obesity is one of the significant health challenges in the world and is highly associated with abnormal adipogenesis. TG-interacting factor 1 (TGIF1) is essential for differentiating murine adipocytes and human adipose tissue-derived stem cells. However, the mode of action needs to be better elucidated. To investigate the roles of TGIF1 in differentiation in-depth, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout technology was performed to generate TGIF1-silenced preadipocytes. The absence of TGIF1 in 3 T3-F442A preadipocytes abolished lipid accumulation throughout the differentiation using Oil Red O staining. Conversely, we established 3 T3-F442A preadipocytes stably expressing TGIF1 and doxycycline-inducible TGIF1 in TGIF1-silenced 3 T3-F442A preadipocytes. Remarkably, the induction of TGIF1 by doxycycline during the initial differentiation phase successfully promoted lipid accumulation in TGIF1-silenced 3 T3-F442A cells. We further explored the mechanisms of TGIF1 in early differentiation. We demonstrated that TGIF1 promoted the mitotic clonal expansion via upregulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins β expression, interruption with peroxisome proliferators activated receptor γ downstream regulation, and inhibition of p27kip1 expression. In conclusion, we strengthen the pivotal roles of TGIF1 in early differentiation, which might contribute to resolving obesity-associated metabolic syndromes.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have favourable outcomes in the treatment of kidney diseases. Pre-B-cell leukaemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) has been reported to be a regulator of self-renewal of stem cells. Whether PBX1 is beneficial to MSCs in the treatment of haemorrhagic shock (HS)-induced kidney damage is unknown. We overexpressed PBX1 in rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) to treat rats with HS and hypoxia-treated human proximal tubule epithelial cells (HK-2), respectively. The results indicated that PBX1 enhanced the homing capacity of rBMSCs to kidney tissues and that treatment with rBMSCs overexpressing PBX1 improved the indicators of kidney function, alleviated structural damage to kidney tissues. Furthermore, administration with rBMSCs overexpressing PBX1 inhibited HS-induced NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and further attenuated apoptosis. We then determined whether NF-κB, an important factor in NLRP3 activation and the regulation of inflammation, participates in HS-induced kidney damage, and we found that rBMSCs overexpressing PBX1 inhibited NF-κB activation by decreasing the p-IκBα/IκBα and p-p65/p65 ratios and inhibiting the nuclear translocation and decreasing the DNA-binding capacity of NF-κB. hBMSCs overexpressing PBX1 also exhibited protective effects on HK-2 cells exposed to hypoxia, as shown by the increase in cell viability, the mitigation of apoptosis, the decrease in inflammation, and the inhibition of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our study demonstrates that MSCs overexpressing PBX1 ameliorates HS-induced kidney damage by inhibiting NF-κB pathway-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the inflammatory response.

Abstract: The nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) subunit p65, plays an important role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Phosphorylation of p65 is considered as an important mechanism for the positive regulation of NF-κB activity. According to our previous data, p65 can be SUMOylated by small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO1) protein, and SUMO1 promotes p65 nuclear import and HCC progression. However, the effect of SUMO1-related p65 SUMOylation on NF-κB transcriptional activity and the relationship between phosphorylation and SUMOylation of p65 remain obscure. Here, we found that phosphorylated p65 level was increased in cancer tissues of HCC patients, and similar phenomenon was found for SUMO1 expression but not for SUMO2/3. Further clinical data showed a positive correlation between SUMO1 and phosphorylated p65. We also verified that overexpression of SUMO1 upregulated phosphorylated p65 levels. Next, we verified SUMO1-related p65 SUMOylation with in vitro SUMOylation assay, constructed mutants of p65 SUMOylation and phosphorylation, and found that SUMO1-related p65 SUMOylation promoted p65 nuclear import and increased NF-κB activity. Both SUMO1-related p65 SUMOylation and p65 phosphorylation (especially at S276 site) increased the viability and invasion of hepatoma cells, and decreased the apoptosis of hepatoma cells. At last, we found that the phosphorylation of p65 promoted the level of SUMO1-related p65 SUMOylation, and SUMO1-related p65 SUMOylation upregulated phosphorylated p65 (at S276 site). Our study contributes to the exploration of the oncogenic mechanism of p65, which is the important protein in HCC.

Abstract: Metabolism of endothelial cells (ECs) depends on the availability of the energy substrates. Since the endothelium is the first line of defence against inflammation in the cardiovascular system and its dysfunction can lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases, it is important to understand how glucose metabolism changes during inflammation. In this work, glucose uptake was studied in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) in high glucose (HG), and additionally in an inflammatory state, using Raman imaging. HG state was induced by incubation of ECs with a deuterated glucose analogue, while the EC inflammation was caused by TNF-α pre-treatment. Spontaneous and stimulated Raman scattering spectroscopy provided comprehensive information on biochemical changes, including lipids and the extent of unsaturation induced by excess glucose in ECs., induced by excess glucose in ECs. In this work, we indicated spectroscopic markers of metabolic changes in ECs as a strong increase in the ratio of the intensity of lipids / (proteins + lipids) bands and an increase in the level of lipid unsaturation and mitochondrial changes. Inflamed ECs treated with HG, revealed enhanced glucose uptake, and intensified lipid production i.a. of unsaturated lipids. Additionally, increased cytochrome c signal in the mitochondrial region indicated higher mitochondrial activity and biogenesis. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful method for determining the metabolic markers of ED which will better inform understanding of disease onset, development, and treatment.

Modified 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy induces cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cell pyroptosis via the JNK signaling pathway,

Abstract: Modified 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (M-PDT) is a novel therapeutic modality for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) that is reported to be effective and well tolerated. However, the mechanisms underlying its antitumor effects are not fully understood. In this research, we investigated the effects of M-PDT on pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death characterized by cell swelling, ruptures of cell membrane, and inflammatory cytokine release, in two human cSCC cell lines, SCL-1 and HSC-5. We found that M-PDT triggered pyroptosis in a dose-dependent manner, as evidenced by increased lactate dehydrogenase release, propidium iodide staining, and expression of pyroptosis-related proteins, such as NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), N-terminal of gasdermin D (N-GSDMD), cleaved caspase-1, and mature interleukin 1 beta (IL-1B) in both cell lines. This process was inhibited by treatment with MCC950, an NLRP3-specific inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in M-PDT-induced pyroptosis. We also demonstrated that M-PDT activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, which is required for pyroptosis induction, as treatment with SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, suppressed the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins after M-PDT. JNK activation enhanced M-PDT-induced pyroptosis, highlighting the significance of the JNK pathway in M-PDT. Moreover, M-PDT increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which are responsible for JNK activation and pyroptosis induction. In summary, our results revealed that M-PDT triggers pyroptosis through ROS-mediated JNK activation and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cSCC cells, providing a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of M-PDT and promoting its clinical application.
