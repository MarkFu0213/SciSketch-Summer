Abstract: Summary
Dendritic spikes function as cardinal components of rodent neocortical circuit computations. Recently, the biophysical properties of human pyramidal neurons (PNs) have been reported to be divergent, raising the question of whether dendritic spikes have homologous roles in the human neocortex. To directly address this, we made electrical recordings from the soma and apical dendrites of human and rat layer 2/3 PNs of the temporal cortex. In both species, dendritic excitatory input led to the initiation of sodium-channel-mediated dendritic spikes. Dendritic sodium spikes could be generated across a wide input range, exhibited a similar frequency range of activation, and forward-propagated with high-fidelity to implement stereotyped computations in human and rat PNs. However, the physical expansion and complexification of the apical dendritic trees of human PNs allowed the enriched expression of dendritic spike generation. The computational capacity of human PNs is therefore enhanced by the widespread implementation of a conserved dendritic integration mechanism.

Abstract: Background
The development of tissue-engineered scaffolds with electrical properties is the primary motivation of novel regenerative medicine. Electroconductive scaffolds are designed to mimic the injured tissue environment's electrical properties and regulate cellular behavior - growth, proliferation, and differentiation - that could stimulate the injured nerve's regeneration.
Methods
We fabricated dedicated electroconductive scaffolds and customized an appropriate device with an external current supply to expose cells on the scaffold to electrical stimulation (ES). Next, we isolated rat adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and performed in vitro experiments that combine cells, an electroconductive scaffold, NGF (nerve growth factor), and ES (90 mV/mm, constant, for four days). Finally, we checked cellular activity as proliferation, viability, morphology, the neurogenic differentiation potential of ASCs, cell alignment, and karyotype.
Results
We observed that the electrical stimulation did not change the viability and chromosome stability of rat ASCs, but altered slightly proliferation compared to non-stimulated cells. The combined effect of a scaffold, NGF, and ES caused morphology changes and enhancement of ASCs neuronal differentiation as indicated in βIII-tubulin expression, actin organization, and upregulation of neurogenic gene expression.
Conclusions
We developed an electroconductive scaffold and customized device for in vitro study with many experimental variants. Based on our results, we presumed that the established study scheme - including an electroconductive scaffold, NGF and ES - is biocompatible and could guide ASCs to differentiate in neurogenic lineage, thus may be potentially applied in nerve injury regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiomyopathy and heart failure are common manifestations in mitochondrial disease caused by deficiencies in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system of mitochondria. Here, we demonstrate that the cardiac-specific loss of the assembly factor Cox10 of the cytochrome c oxidase causes mitochondrial cardiomyopathy in mice, which is associated with OXPHOS deficiency, lysosomal defects, and an aberrant mitochondrial morphology. Activation of the mitochondrial peptidase Oma1 in Cox10−/− mice results in mitochondrial fragmentation and induction of the integrated stress response (ISR) along the Oma1-Dele1-Atf4 signaling axis. Ablation of Oma1 or Dele1 in Cox10−/− mice aggravates cardiomyopathy. ISR inhibition impairs the cardiac glutathione metabolism, limits the selenium-dependent accumulation of the glutathione peroxidase Gpx4, and increases lipid peroxidation in the heart, ultimately culminating in ferroptosis. Our results demonstrate a protective role of the Oma1-Dele1-mediated ISR in mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and link ferroptosis to OXPHOS deficiency and mitochondrial disease.

Abstract: Summary
We present the largest whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to date among 6,004 individuals of Chinese ancestry, coupled with 23,049 individuals genotyped by SNP array. We construct a high-quality haplotype reference panel for imputation and identify 20 common and low-frequency loci (minor allele frequency [MAF] ≥ 0.5%), including five loci that have never been reported before. For rare loss-of-function (LoF) variants (MAF < 0.5%), we identify BRCA2 and 18 other cancer predisposition genes that affect 5.29% of individuals with NSCLC, and 98.91% (181 of 183) of LoF variants have not been linked previously to NSCLC risk. Promoter variants of BRCA2 also have a substantial effect on NSCLC risk, and their prevalence is comparable with BRCA2 LoF variants. The associations are validated in an independent case-control study including 4,410 individuals and a prospective cohort study including 23,826 individuals. Our findings not only provide a high-quality reference panel for future array-based association studies but depict the whole picture of rare pathogenic variants for NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Aminoglycosides (AGs) are potent antibiotics that are capable of treating a wide variety of life-threatening infections; however, they are ototoxic and cause irreversible damage to cochlear hair cells. Despite substantial progress, little is known about the molecular pathways critical for hair cell function and survival that are affected by AG exposure. We demonstrate here that gentamicin, a representative AG antibiotic, binds to and within minutes triggers translocation of RIPOR2 in murine hair cells from stereocilia to the pericuticular area. Then, by interacting with a central autophagy component, GABARAP, RIPOR2 affects autophagy activation. Reducing the expression of RIPOR2 or GABARAP completely prevents AG-induced hair cell death and subsequent hearing loss in mice. Additionally, abolishing the expression of PINK1 or Parkin, two key mitochondrial autophagy proteins, prevents hair cell death and subsequent hearing loss caused by AG. In summary, our study demonstrates that RIPOR2-mediated autophagic dysfunction is essential for AG-induced hearing loss.

Abstract: Summary
Motoneurons and motoneuron-like pancreatic β cells arise from radial glia and ductal cells, respectively, both tube-lining progenitors that share molecular regulators. To uncover programs underlying motoneuron formation, we studied a similar, cell-division-independent transformation of the C. elegans tube-lining Y cell into the PDA motoneuron. We find that lin-12/Notch acts through ngn-1/Ngn and its regulator hlh-16/Olig to control transformation timing. lin-12 loss blocks transformation, while lin-12(gf) promotes precocious PDA formation. Early basal expression of ngn-1/Ngn and hlh-16/Olig depends on sem-4/Sall and egl-5/Hox. Later, coincident with Y cell morphological changes, ngn-1/Ngn expression is upregulated in a sem-4/Sall and egl-5/Hox-dependent but hlh-16/Olig-independent manner. Subsequently, Y cell retrograde extension forms an anchored process priming PDA axon extension. Extension requires ngn-1-dependent expression of the cytoskeleton organizers UNC-119, UNC-44/ANK, and UNC-33/CRMP, which also activate PDA terminal-gene expression. Our findings uncover cell-division-independent regulatory events leading to motoneuron generation, suggesting a conserved pathway for epithelial-to-motoneuron/motoneuron-like cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
ATR kinase is a central regulator of the DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle checkpoints. ATR kinase inhibitors (ATRi's) combine with radiation to generate CD8+ T cell-dependent responses in mouse models of cancer. We show that ATRi's induce cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)-dependent origin firing across active replicons in CD8+ T cells activated ex vivo while simultaneously decreasing the activity of rate-limiting enzymes for nucleotide biosynthesis. These pleiotropic effects of ATRi induce deoxyuridine (dU) contamination in genomic DNA, R loops, RNA-DNA polymerase collisions, and interferon-α/β (IFN-α/β). Remarkably, thymidine rescues ATRi-induced dU contamination and partially rescues death and IFN-α/β expression in proliferating CD8+ T cells. Thymidine also partially rescues ATRi-induced cancer cell death. We propose that ATRi-induced dU contamination contributes to dose-limiting leukocytopenia and inflammation in the clinic and CD8+ T cell-dependent anti-tumor responses in mouse models. We conclude that ATR is essential to limit dU contamination in genomic DNA and IFN-α/β expression.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells, originally derived from the embryonic mesenchyme, and able to differentiate into connective tissues such as bone, fat, cartilage, tendon, and muscle. Furthermore, MSCs derived from adipose tissue ADSC (Adipose derived Stem Cells) show a great potential for degenerative diseases treatment. In this study, we designed a series of experiments based on real-time rt-QPCR to validated a commercially available kit able to explore changes in gene expression under osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of human ADSC. Initially, we selected a better indicators of trilineage differentiation by using third passages of cultured ADSC from stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from fresh adipose tissue by enzymatic digestion. On the basis of statistically significant results ACAN, FABP4A and Col11a1 were chosen as indicators of chondrogenic, adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation respectively. An in-vitro aging analysis was then performed to evaluate the ADSC passage with the highest differentiation potential. Total RNA extraction from induced differentiation and controls ADSC from passage 2–6 and relative quantifications of mRNA expression of selected genes were performed according to rt-PCR kits tested. The chondrogenic differentiation test showed equivalent ∆∆Ct values for ACAN detection for cell passages ranging from P3 to P6, proving that they can be considered as equivalent samples for differentiation assays evaluation. For what concerns adipogenic differentiation and FABP4 detection, similar results were observed in all the cell passages tested; on the contrary only passage P6 showed suitable ∆∆Ct values for Col11a1 detection for osteogenic differentiation evaluation. In conclusion, we have validated a suitable real-time rt-QPCR protocol for osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic ADSC differentiation ability evaluation in-vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptive behavior is coordinated by neuronal networks that are distributed across multiple brain regions such as in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical (CBGTC) network. Here, we ask how cross-regional interactions within such mesoscale circuits reorganize when an animal learns a new task. We apply multi-fiber photometry to chronically record simultaneous activity in 12 or 48 brain regions of mice trained in a tactile discrimination task. With improving task performance, most regions shift their peak activity from the time of reward-related action to the reward-predicting stimulus. By estimating cross-regional interactions using transfer entropy, we reveal that functional networks encompassing basal ganglia, thalamus, neocortex, and hippocampus grow and stabilize upon learning, especially at stimulus presentation time. The internal globus pallidus, ventromedial thalamus, and several regions in the frontal cortex emerge as salient hub regions. Our results highlight the learning-related dynamic reorganization that brain networks undergo when task-appropriate mesoscale network dynamics are established for goal-oriented behavior.

Abstract: Compared with acute pancreatitis caused by other reasons, hyperlipidemia pancreatitis has a higher severity, complication and organ failure rate. Our previous studies have found that hyperglycemia may promote the occurrence and development of hyperlipidemia pancreatitis, but the mechanism is still unclear. Pancreatic acinar cell injury is the initial link of acute pancreatitis and plays a vital role in the course of the disease. The aim of the present study was to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between hyperlipidemia acute pancreatitis (HLAP) mouse and hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia acute pancreatitis (HLGAP) mouse by RNA-sequence. The GO and KEGG analysis of these DEGs did not indicate a direct pathway related to acinar cell injury. However, in further targeted analysis, we found that there are different genes related to cell injury between the HLAP and HLGAP groups, such as necroptosis, autophagy, mitophagy and ferroptosis. In the later immunofluorescence experiments, it was also confirmed that the genes related to cell injury were significantly differentially expressed between the two groups. In conclusion, there are multiple cell injury modes in the course of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia pancreatitis. More importantly, the correlation and transition between multiple cell injury modes may be the key mechanism for the occurrence and development of pancreatitis.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) and NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 (NLRP6) are highly expressed in intestinal tissues. Loss of ERβ and NLRP6 exacerbate colitis in mouse models; however, the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we report that ERβ directly activates the NLRP6 gene expression via binding to estrogen responsive element of Nlrp6 gene promoter. ERβ also physically interacts with the NLRP6 nucleotide-binding domain and promotes NLRP6 inflammasome assembly. The ERβ-NLRP6 axis then interacts with multiple autophagy-related proteins, including ULK1, BECN1, ATG16L1, LC3B, and p62, and affects the autophagosome biogenesis and autophagic flux. Finally, NLRP6-mediated autophagy suppresses the inflammatory response by promoting the K48-linked polyubiquitination of ASC, Casp-1 p20, IL-1β, TNF-α, and prohibitin-2. Thus, ERβ-NLRP6 direct an anti-inflammatory response by promoting autophagy. Our work uncovers an ERβ-NLRP6-autophagy pathway as a regulatory mechanism that maintains intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis and facilitates tissue repair in colitis.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the brain’s gateway to the visual world. They can be classified into different types on the basis of their electrophysiological, transcriptomic, or morphological characteristics. Here, we characterize the transcriptomic, morphological, and functional features of 472 high-quality RGCs using Patch sequencing (Patch-seq), providing functional and morphological annotation of many transcriptomic-defined cell types of a previously established RGC atlas. We show a convergence of different modalities in defining the RGC identity and reveal the degree of correspondence for well-characterized cell types across multimodal data. Moreover, we complement some RGC types with detailed morphological and functional properties. We also identify differentially expressed genes among ON, OFF, and ON-OFF RGCs such as Vat1l, Slitrk6, and Lmo7, providing candidate marker genes for functional studies. Our research suggests that the molecularly distinct clusters may also differ in their roles of encoding visual information.

Abstract: The fructose-streptozotocin (FRU-STZ) diabetic model has been presented as a viable model of type2 diabetes but its impact on the testes and epididymis of Wistar rats is yet to be investigated. In this study, we probed the role of caffeic acid, a potent antioxidant, in FRU-STZ diabetic rats. Twenty normoglycemic rats were randomly divided into four groups of five rats each: Control, Fructose-Streptozotocin (FRU+STZ), Fructose-Streptozotocin + Caffeic Acid (FRU+STZ+CA), and Caffeic Acid (CA). Diabetes was induced by the administration of 10 % fructose solution ad libitum for 2 weeks followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg bwt of streptozotocin. Treatment with CA (50 mg/kg bwt) lasted for two weeks. Results showed that FRU-STZ diabetes was able to induce amyloidosis and histopathological deficits in the testis and epididymis characteristic of cytotoxic agents. Poor PCNA immunoreactivity, reactive Nrf2 expression, and defective steroidogenesis were also observed in the diabetic group. FRU-STZ diabetes was also associated with significantly increased Na+-K+ ATPase activity in both testes and epididymis. Treatment with caffeic acid was able to restore steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis in the diabetic rats to levels comparable to the control; histological features and Na+-K+ ATPase activity were also reduced in the CA-treated group. Generally, normal rats treated with caffeic acid did not evince any deleterious effects. Our study demonstrates that CA exerts a protective role in FRU-STZ diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is poorly responsive to therapy and invariably lethal. One conceivable strategy to circumvent this intractability is to co-target distinctive mechanistic components of the disease, aiming to concomitantly disrupt multiple capabilities required for tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. We assessed this concept by combining vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibitors that remodel the tumor vasculature with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, which enhances autophagy in GBM cancer cells and unexpectedly reprograms immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages via inhibition of histamine receptor signaling to become immunostimulatory. While neither drug is efficacious as monotherapy, the combination of imipramine with VEGF pathway inhibitors orchestrates the infiltration and activation of CD8 and CD4 T cells, producing significant therapeutic benefit in several GBM mouse models. Inclusion up front of immune-checkpoint blockade with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in eventually relapsing tumors markedly extends survival benefit. The results illustrate the potential of mechanism-guided therapeutic co-targeting of disparate biological vulnerabilities in the tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Background
Previous observations illustrated that programmed cell death ligand 1 in exosomes (Exo-PD-L1) may lead to immunosuppression. This study proposed to investigate the significance of Exo-PD-L1 and the results of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.
Methods
29 lung cancer patients were enrolled. Exosomes were extracted from the blood of patients and purified, and the extracts were identified by Western blot and transmission electron microscope. Next, the levels of Exo-PD-L1 and PD-L1 in tumor tissue were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IHC, respectively. The correlation between Exo-PD-L1, IHC PD-L1 status and pathological features of patients was analyzed by applying Chi-square test. After immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment, the objective response rate (ORR) was calculated, and drug response prediction in lung cancer patients by using Exo-PD-L1 alone, IHC PD-L1 alone, and their combined detection were analyzed.
Results
This study confirmed that lung cancer patients had much expression of PD-L1 in blood exosomes and that Exo-PD-L1 level was associated with IHC PD-L1 status. The expression level of Exo-PD-L1 was evidently related to the positive lymph node metastasis of lung cancer patients, while IHC PD-L1 status was not correlated with clinicopathological features of patients. Moreover, Exo-PD-L1 and IHC PD-L1 alone or their combined detection could be utilized to predict the efficacy of ICI therapy in lung cancer patients.
Conclusion
The correlation between Exo-PD-L1 and IHC PD-L1 status was indicated, and Exo-PD-L1 could assist in determining the suitable lung cancer patients suitable for ICI therapy using IHC PD-L1. This study provides references for the application of Exo-PD-L1 as an effective predictor of ICI therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis induces immunogenic cell death and promotes inflammation. However, the functions of GSDMD in tissue homeostasis remain unclear. Here, we identify a physiological function of GSDMD in osteoclasts via a non-lytic p20-generated protein, which prevents bone loss to maintain bone homeostasis. In the late stage of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, GSDMD underwent cleavage, which is dependent on RIPK1 and caspase-8/-3, to yield this p20 product. Gsdmd-deficient osteoclasts showed normal differentiation but enhanced bone resorption with excessive lysosomal activity. Mice with complete or myeloid-specific Gsdmd deletion exhibited increased trabecular bone loss and more severe aging/ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis. GSDMD p20 was preferentially localized to early endosomes and limited endo-lysosomal trafficking and maturation, relying on its oligomerization and control of phosphoinositide conversion by binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P). We have thus identified an anti-osteoclastic function of GSDMD as a checkpoint for lysosomal maturation and secretion and linked this to bone homeostasis and endosome-lysosome biology.

Abstract: Summary
A critical determinant of DNA repair pathway choice is REV7, an adaptor that binds to various DNA repair proteins through its C-terminal seatbelt domain. The REV7 seatbelt binds to either REV3, activating translesion synthesis, or to SHLD3, activating non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. Recent studies have identified another REV7 seatbelt-binding protein, CHAMP1 (chromosome alignment-maintaining phosphoprotein 1), though its possible role in DNA repair is unknown. Here, we show that binding of CHAMP1 to REV7 activates homologous recombination (HR) repair. Mechanistically, CHAMP1 binds directly to REV7 and reduces the level of the Shieldin complex, causing an increase in double-strand break end resection. CHAMP1 also interacts with POGZ in a heterochromatin complex further promoting HR repair. Importantly, in human tumors, CHAMP1 overexpression promotes HR, confers poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor resistance, and correlates with poor prognosis. Thus, by binding to either SHLD3 or CHAMP1 through its seatbelt, the REV7 protein can promote either NHEJ or HR repair, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) lyse target cells by delivering lytic granules that contain the pore former perforin to the cytotoxic immunological synapse. Here, we establish that opposing cytoskeletal forces drive lytic granule polarization and simultaneously shape T cell synapse topography to enhance target perforation. At the cell rear, actomyosin contractility drives the anterograde movement of lytic granules toward the nucleus. At the synapse, dynein-derived forces induce negatively curved membrane pockets to which granules are transported around the nucleus. These highly concave degranulation pockets are located directly opposite positively curved bulges on the target cell membrane. We identify a curvature bias in the action of perforin, which preferentially perforates positively curved tumor cell membrane. Together, these findings demonstrate murine and human T cell-mediated cytotoxicity to be a highly tuned mechano-biochemical system, in which the forces that polarize lytic granules locally bend the synaptic membrane to favor the unidirectional perforation of the target cell.

Abstract: Our previous study reported that a part of small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells in the rat superior cervical ganglion were innervated by P2X3 purinoceptor-expressing glossopharyngeal sensory nerve endings, suggesting the occurrence of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)-mediated transmission between them. The present study investigated the immunolocalization of vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) in SIF cells of the superior cervical ganglion in male Wistar rats. VNUT was immunohistochemically localized in tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive SIF cells and sympathetic postganglionic neurons, but not in a few SIF cells with immunoreactivity for dopamine beta-hydroxylase. P2X3-immunoreactive ramified nerve endings formed flat leaf-like or spherical terminal parts to surround some VNUT-immunoreactive SIF cells, but not other VNUT-immunoreactive SIF cells attached to ganglionic neurons. VNUT-immunoreactive SIF cells contained bassoon-immunoreactive products at the contacting surface of P2X3-immunoreactive nerve endings. Immunoreactivity for ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2, which hydrolyzes extracellular ATP, was observed in S100B-immunoreactive satellite glial cells surrounding VNUT-immunoreactive SIF cells, but not in the attachment surfaces between SIF cells and nerve endings with P2X3 immunoreactivity. The present results suggest that SIF cells release ATP by exocytosis to modulate the excitability of sensory nerve endings and postganglionic neurons in the superior cervical ganglion.

Abstract: Summary
Communication in bilaterian nervous systems is mediated by electrical and secreted signals; however, the evolutionary origin and relation of neurons to other secretory cell types has not been elucidated. Here, we use developmental single-cell RNA sequencing in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, representing an early evolutionary lineage with a simple nervous system. Validated by transgenics, we demonstrate that neurons, stinging cells, and gland cells arise from a common multipotent progenitor population. We identify the conserved transcription factor gene SoxC as a key upstream regulator of all neuroglandular lineages and demonstrate that SoxC knockdown eliminates both neuronal and secretory cell types. While in vertebrates and many other bilaterians neurogenesis is largely restricted to early developmental stages, we show that in the sea anemone, differentiation of neuroglandular cells is maintained throughout all life stages, and follows the same molecular trajectories from embryo to adulthood, ensuring lifelong homeostasis of neuroglandular cell lineages.

Abstract: Summary
Advanced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rapidly emerging global health problem associated with pre-disposing genetic polymorphisms, most strikingly an isoleucine to methionine substitution in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3-I148M). Here, we study how human hepatocytes with PNPLA3 148I and 148M variants engrafted in the livers of broadly immunodeficient chimeric mice respond to hypercaloric diets. As early as four weeks, mice developed dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and steatosis with ballooning degeneration selectively in the human graft, followed by pericellular fibrosis after eight weeks of hypercaloric feeding. Hepatocytes with the PNPLA3-148M variant, either from a homozygous 148M donor or overexpressed in a 148I donor background, developed microvesicular and severe steatosis with frequent ballooning degeneration, resulting in more active steatohepatitis than 148I hepatocytes. We conclude that PNPLA3-148M in human hepatocytes exacerbates NAFLD. These models will facilitate mechanistic studies into human genetic variant contributions to advanced fatty liver diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Lung cancer is a highly aggressive and metastatic disease responsible for approximately 25% of all cancer-related deaths in the United States. Using high-throughput in vitro and in vivo screens, we have previously established Impad1 as a driver of lung cancer invasion and metastasis. Here we elucidate that Impad1 is a direct target of the epithelial microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-200 and miR∼96 and is de-repressed during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT); thus, we establish a mode of regulation of the protein. Impad1 modulates Golgi apparatus morphology and vesicular trafficking through its interaction with a trafficking protein, Syt11. These changes in Golgi apparatus dynamics alter the extracellular matrix and the tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote invasion and metastasis. Inhibiting Impad1 or Syt11 disrupts the cancer cell secretome, regulates the TME, and reverses the invasive or metastatic phenotype. This work identifies Impad1 as a regulator of EMT and secretome-mediated changes during lung cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Excessive Na+ in soils inhibits plant growth. Here, we report that Na+ stress triggers primary calcium signals specifically in a cell group within the root differentiation zone, thus forming a “sodium-sensing niche” in Arabidopsis. The amplitude of this primary calcium signal and the speed of the resulting Ca2+ wave dose-dependently increase with rising Na+ concentrations, thus providing quantitative information about the stress intensity encountered. We also delineate a Ca2+-sensing mechanism that measures the stress intensity in order to mount appropriate salt detoxification responses. This is mediated by a Ca2+-sensor-switch mechanism, in which the sensors SOS3/CBL4 and CBL8 are activated by distinct Ca2+-signal amplitudes. Although the SOS3/CBL4-SOS2/CIPK24-SOS1 axis confers basal salt tolerance, the CBL8-SOS2/CIPK24-SOS1 module becomes additionally activated only in response to severe salt stress. Thus, Ca2+-mediated translation of Na+ stress intensity into SOS1 Na+/H+ antiporter activity facilitates fine tuning of the sodium extrusion capacity for optimized salt-stress tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) increases epithelial cancer cell migration and metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). TGF-β also inhibits cell proliferation by inducing G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. However, the correlation between these tumor-promoting and -suppressing effects remains unclear. Here, we show that TGF-β confers higher motility and metastatic ability to oral cancer cells in G1 phase. Mechanistically, keratin-associated protein 2-3 (KRTAP2-3) is a regulator of these dual effects of TGF-β, and its expression is correlated with tumor progression in patients with head and neck cancer and migratory and metastatic potentials of oral cancer cells. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that TGF-β generates two populations of mesenchymal cancer cells with differential cell-cycle status through two distinctive EMT pathways mediated by Slug/HMGA2 and KRTAP2-3. Thus, TGF-β-induced KRTAP2-3 orchestrates cancer cell proliferation and migration by inducing EMT, suggesting motile cancer cells arrested in G1 phase as a target to suppress metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-surface ancillary glycoproteins basigin or embigin form heterodimeric complexes with proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), facilitating the membrane trafficking of MCTs and regulating their transport activities. Here, we determine the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human MCT1-embigin complex and observe that embigin forms extensive interactions with MCT1 to facilitate its localization to the plasma membrane. In addition, the formation of the heterodimer effectively blocks MCT1 from forming a homodimer through a steric hindrance effect, releasing the coupling between two signature motifs and driving a significant conformation change in transmembrane helix 5 (TM5) of MCTs. Consequently, the substrate-binding pocket alternates between states of homodimeric coupling and heterodimeric decoupling states and exhibits differences in substrate-binding affinity, supporting the hypothesis that the substrate-induced motion originating in one subunit of the MCT dimer could be transmitted to the adjacent subunit to alter its substrate-binding affinity.

Abstract: Summary
High expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells contributes to tumor immune evasion. However, whether PD-L1 expression in tumor cells is regulated by the availability of nutrients is unknown. Here, we show that in human glioblastoma cells, high glucose promotes hexokinase (HK) 2 dissociation from mitochondria and its subsequent binding and phosphorylation of IκBα at T291. This leads to increased interaction between IκBα and μ-calpain protease and subsequent μ-calpain-mediated IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation-dependent transcriptional upregulation of PD-L1 expression. Expression of IκBα T291A in glioblastoma cells blocked high glucose-induced PD-L1 expression and promoted CD8+ T cell activation and infiltration into the tumor tissue, reducing brain tumor growth. Combined treatment with an HK inhibitor and an anti-PD-1 antibody eliminates tumor immune evasion and remarkably enhances the anti-tumor effect of immune checkpoint blockade. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism underlying the upregulation of PD-L1 expression mediated by aerobic glycolysis and underscore the roles of HK2 as a glucose sensor and a protein kinase in regulation of tumor immune evasion.

Abstract: Summary
Immunotherapy is improving the prognosis and survival of cancer patients, but despite encouraging outcomes in different cancers, the majority of tumors are resistant to it, and the immunotherapy combinations are often accompanied by severe side effects. Here, we show that a periodic fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) can act on the tumor microenvironment and increase the efficacy of immunotherapy (anti-PD-L1 and anti-OX40) against the poorly immunogenic triple-negative breast tumors (TNBCs) by expanding early exhausted effector T cells, switching the cancer metabolism from glycolytic to respiratory, and reducing collagen deposition. Furthermore, FMD reduces the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) by preventing the hyperactivation of the immune response. These results indicate that FMD cycles have the potential to enhance the efficacy of anti-cancer immune responses, expand the portion of tumors sensitive to immunotherapy, and reduce its side effects.

Abstract: Summary
Effector trogocytosis between malignant cells and tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) contributes to immune evasion through antigen loss on target cells and fratricide of antigen-experienced CTLs by other CTLs. The mechanisms regulating these events in tumors remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-derived factors (TDFs) stimulated effector trogocytosis and restricted CTLs’ tumoricidal activity and viability in vitro. TDFs robustly altered the CTL’s lipid profile, including depletion of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). 25HC inhibited trogocytosis and prevented CTL’s inactivation and fratricide. Mechanistically, TDFs induced ATF3 transcription factor that suppressed the expression of 25HC-regulating gene—cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). Stimulation of trogocytosis in the intratumoral CTL by the ATF3-CH25H axis attenuated anti-tumor immunity, stimulated tumor growth, and impeded the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell adoptive therapy. Through use of armored CAR constructs or pharmacologic agents restoring CH25H expression, we reversed these phenotypes and increased the efficacy of immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
The immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab is US FDA approved for treatment of solid tumors with high tumor mutational burden (TMB-high; ≥10 variants/Mb). However, the extent to which TMB-high generalizes as an accurate biomarker in diverse patient populations is largely unknown. Using two clinical cohorts, we investigated the interplay between genetic ancestry, TMB, and tumor-only versus tumor-normal paired sequencing in solid tumors. TMB estimates from tumor-only panels substantially overclassified individuals into the clinically important TMB-high group due to germline contamination, and this bias was particularly pronounced in patients with Asian/African ancestry. Among patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with ICIs, those misclassified as TMB-high from tumor-only panels did not associate with improved outcomes. TMB-high was significantly associated with improved outcomes only in European ancestries and merits validation in non-European ancestry populations. Ancestry-aware tumor-only TMB calibration and ancestry-diverse biomarker studies are critical to ensure that existing disparities are not exacerbated in precision medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Complex genomes show intricate organization in three-dimensional (3D) nuclear space. Current models posit that cohesin extrudes loops to form self-interacting domains delimited by the DNA binding protein CTCF. Here, we describe and quantitatively characterize cohesin-propelled, jet-like chromatin contacts as landmarks of loop extrusion in quiescent mammalian lymphocytes. Experimental observations and polymer simulations indicate that narrow origins of loop extrusion favor jet formation. Unless constrained by CTCF, jets propagate symmetrically for 1–2 Mb, providing an estimate for the range of in vivo loop extrusion. Asymmetric CTCF binding deflects the angle of jet propagation as experimental evidence that cohesin-mediated loop extrusion can switch from bi- to unidirectional and is controlled independently in both directions. These data offer new insights into the physiological behavior of in vivo cohesin-mediated loop extrusion and further our understanding of the principles that underlie genome organization.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the most common cancer and one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths, presenting in most cases as metastatic disease. Given the frequent gene mutation and/or signaling deregulation in lung adenocarcinoma, identifying novel factors or agents that target these signaling pathways may be promising strategies for lung adenocarcinoma therapy. Herein, we identified inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2) as an aberrantly downregulated gene in lung adenocarcinoma. ID2 overexpression not only suppressed the viability, colony formation ability, and migration ability of lung adenocarcinoma cells but also decreased the protein levels of N-cadherin, MMP2, MMP9 and the phosphorylation levels of AKT and mTOR. The effects of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling agonist on lung adenocarcinoma cells were opposite to those of ID2 overexpression, partially reversing the effects of ID2 overexpression. In these experimental tissue samples, ID2 protein levels and mRNA expression were also down-regulated compared with those in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Altogether, these findings indicated that ID2 exerts its tumor-suppressive effects on the malignant behavior of lung adenocarcinoma cells by inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Restoration of ID2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells may improve the therapeutic efficacy of lung adenocarcinoma therapies.

Abstract: Summary
RAF kinases are RAS-activated enzymes that initiate signaling through the MAPK cascade to control cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Here, we describe the structure of the full-length RAF1 protein in complex with HSP90 and CDC37 obtained by cryoelectron microscopy. The reconstruction reveals a RAF1 kinase with an unfolded N-lobe separated from its C-lobe. The hydrophobic core of the N-lobe is trapped in the HSP90 dimer, while CDC37 wraps around the chaperone and interacts with the N- and C-lobes of the kinase. The structure indicates how CDC37 can discriminate between the different members of the RAF family. Our structural analysis also reveals that the folded RAF1 assembles with 14-3-3 dimers, suggesting that after folding RAF1 follows a similar activation as B-RAF.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary fibers are potent modulators of immune responses that can restrain inflammation in multiple disease contexts. However, dietary fibers encompass a biochemically diverse family of carbohydrates, and it remains unknown how individual fiber sources influence immunity. In a direct comparison of four different high-fiber diets, we demonstrate a potent ability of guar gum to delay disease and neuroinflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a T cell-mediated mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Guar gum-specific alterations to the microbiota are limited, and disease protection appears to be independent of fiber-induced increases in short-chain fatty acid levels or regulatory CD4+ T cells. Instead, CD4+ T cells of guar gum-supplemented mice are less encephalitogenic due to reduced activation, proliferation, Th1 differentiation, and altered migratory potential. These findings reveal specificity in the host response to fiber sources and define a pathway of fiber-induced immunomodulation that protects against pathologic neuroinflammation.

Abstract: Distributions of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2 (TRPV2) were examined in the human minor salivary glands. ChAT-, VIP- and DBH-immunoreactive (-IR) nerve fibers were detected within nerve bundles and close to blood vessels and ducts in the salivary glands. Periacinar nerve fibers were commonly immunoreactive for ChAT in the Ebner’s gland but infrequently in other salivary glands. Periacinar VIP-IR nerve fibers were numerous in the palatal gland, moderate in the lingual gland and relatively rare in the labial and Ebner’s glands. Some TH-, NPY- and TRPV2-IR nerve fibers were also present around blood vessels and glandular acini in the palatal, lingual and Ebner’s glands. Neuronal cells in the vicinity of Ebner’s and lingual glands were immunoreactive for ChAT, VIP, TH and TRPV2. By confocal laser scanning microscopy, VIP- and ChAT-IR varicosities were located in the vicinity of myoepithelial and acinar cells in the minor salivary glands. The human minor salivary glands are probably innervated by parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. Neurotransmitters including neuropeptides in these nerves are thought to be correlated to vasodilation and/or salivary secretion. Acetylcholine and VIP may regulate secretion of the saliva and its components in the salivary glands.

Abstract: Aim
Balance between osteoclasts and osteoblasts was important for bone development and regeneration, which attracted wide attention. To investigate whether the pro-restorative effect of salidroside (SAL) on knee osteoarthritis in mice was associated with adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK).
Methods
MC3T3-E1 cells were used to perform CCK8, ALP measurement, alizarin red assay and western blot. Mouse model with knee osteoarthritis was constructed and received the treatment of SAL. Body weight, arthritis index, and inflammatory factors were recorded and measured. The paraffin sections of knee bone joints were performed by HE and immunohistochemical staining. Western blot was carried out. CCK8, EDU and flow cytometry were used to analyzed the inhibitory effect of salidroside on osteoclast.
Results
We found that salidroside could promote osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, and upregulate COL1A1, RUNX2 and OCN proteins and increase ALP content and phosphorylation level of AMPK. In vivo assays showed that salidroside inhibited inflammatory reaction, improved pathological condition. Salidroside reduced TRAP and NFATc1 expression, and increased the expression of ALP, COL1A1, RUNX2 and OCN proteins. p-AMPK protein was upregulated by salidroside treatment. We also performed in vitro assay, and found salidroside could inhibit proliferation of osteoclast and increase apoptosis of osteoclast.
Conclusion
In a word, salidroside promoted osteoblast proliferation and differentiation through AMPK activation to further inhibit osteoclast bone resorption, so as to achieve the purpose of relieving knee osteoarthritis.

Abstract: Summary
Bile acids (BAs) are complex and incompletely understood enterohepatic-derived hormones that control whole-body metabolism. Here, we profiled postprandial BAs in the liver, feces, and plasma of 360 chow- or high-fat-diet-fed BXD male mice and demonstrated that both genetics and diet strongly influence BA abundance, composition, and correlation with metabolic traits. Through an integrated systems approach, we mapped hundreds of quantitative trait loci that modulate BAs and identified both known and unknown regulators of BA homeostasis. In particular, we discovered carboxylesterase 1c (Ces1c) as a genetic determinant of plasma tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a BA species with established disease-preventing actions. The association between Ces1c and plasma TUDCA was validated using data from independent mouse cohorts and a Ces1c knockout mouse model. Collectively, our data are a unique resource to dissect the physiological importance of BAs as determinants of metabolic traits, as underscored by the identification of CES1C as a master regulator of plasma TUDCA levels.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play important roles during development. Although bi-directional communication between microglia and neuronal progenitors or immature neurons has been demonstrated, the main sites of interaction and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. By using advanced methods, here we provide evidence that microglial processes form specialized contacts with the cell bodies of developing neurons throughout embryonic, early postnatal, and adult neurogenesis. These early developmental contacts are highly reminiscent of somatic purinergic junctions that are instrumental for microglia-neuron communication in the adult brain. The formation and maintenance of these junctions is regulated by functional microglial P2Y12 receptors, and deletion of P2Y12Rs disturbs proliferation of neuronal precursors and leads to aberrant cortical cytoarchitecture during development and in adulthood. We propose that early developmental formation of somatic purinergic junctions represents an important interface for microglia to monitor the status of immature neurons and control neurodevelopment.

Abstract: Summary
Spaceflight poses risks to the central nervous system (CNS), and understanding neurological responses is important for future missions. We report CNS changes in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to spaceflight microgravity (SFμg) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) via inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SFμg exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFμg and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFμg. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFμg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight.

Abstract: The bacterial cell wall is composed of a thick layer of peptidoglycan and cell wall polymers, which are either embedded in the membrane or linked to the peptidoglycan backbone and referred to as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and wall teichoic acid (WTA), respectively. Modifications of the peptidoglycan or WTA backbone can alter the susceptibility of the bacterial cell towards cationic antimicrobials and lysozyme. The human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is intrinsically resistant towards lysozyme, mainly due to deacetylation and O-acetylation of the peptidoglycan backbone via PgdA and OatA. Recent studies identified additional factors, which contribute to the lysozyme resistance of this pathogen. One of these is the predicted ABC transporter, EslABC. An eslB mutant is hyper-sensitive towards lysozyme, likely due to the production of thinner and less O-acetylated peptidoglycan. Using a suppressor screen, we show here that suppression of eslB phenotypes could be achieved by enhancing peptidoglycan biosynthesis, reducing peptidoglycan hydrolysis or alterations in WTA biosynthesis and modification. The lack of EslB also leads to a higher negative surface charge, which likely stimulates the activity of peptidoglycan hydrolases and lysozyme. Based on our results, we hypothesize that the portion of cell surface exposed WTA is increased in the eslB mutant due to the thinner peptidoglycan layer and that latter one could be caused by an impairment in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) production or distribution.

Abstract: Summary
Glymphatic fluid transport eliminates metabolic waste from the brain including amyloid-β, yet the methodology for studying efflux remains rudimentary. Here, we develop a method to evaluate glymphatic real-time clearance. Efflux of Direct Blue 53 (DB53, also T-1824 or Evans Blue) injected into the striatum is quantified by imaging the DB53 signal in the vascular compartment, where it is retained due to its high affinity to albumin. The DB53 signal is detectable as early as 15 min after injection and the efflux kinetics are sharply reduced in mice lacking the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4). Pharmacokinetic modeling reveal that DB53 efflux is consistent with the existence of two efflux paths, one with fast kinetics (T1/2 = 50 min) and another with slow kinetics (T1/2 = 240 min), in wild-type mice. This in vivo methodology will aid in defining the physiological variables that drive efflux, as well as the impact of brain states or disorders on clearance kinetics.

Abstract: Summary
Persistent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces islet inflammation and β cell loss. How islet inflammation contributes to β cell loss remains uncertain. We have reported previously that chronic overnutrition-induced ER stress in β cells causes Ripk3-mediated islet inflammation, macrophage recruitment, and a reduction of β cell numbers in a zebrafish model. We show here that β cell loss results from the intricate communications among β cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Macrophage-derived Tnfa induces cxcl8a in β cells. Cxcl8a, in turn, attracts neutrophils to macrophage-contacted “hotspots” where β cell loss occurs. We also show potentiation of chemokine expression in stressed mammalian β cells by macrophage-derived TNFA. In Akita and db/db mice, there is an increase in CXCL15-positive β cells and intra-islet neutrophils. Blocking neutrophil recruitment in Akita mice preserves β cell mass and slows diabetes progression. These results reveal an important role of neutrophils in persistent ER stress-induced β cell loss.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial communities execute metabolic pathways to drive global nutrient cycles. Within a community, functionally specialized strains can perform different yet complementary steps within a linear pathway, a phenomenon termed metabolic division of labor (MDOL). However, little is known about how such metabolic behaviors shape microbial communities. Here, we derive a theoretical framework to define the assembly of a community that degrades an organic compound through MDOL. The framework indicates that to ensure community stability, the strains performing the initial steps should hold a growth advantage (m) over the “private benefit” (n) of the strain performing the last step. The steady-state frequency of the last strain is then determined by the quotient of n and m. Our experiments show that the framework accurately predicts the assembly of our synthetic consortia that degrade naphthalene through MDOL. Our results provide insights for designing and managing stable microbial systems for metabolic pathway optimization.

Abstract: Summary
Microbiome dysbiosis is a feature of diabetes, but how microbial products influence insulin production is poorly understood. We report the mechanism of BefA, a microbiome-derived protein that increases proliferation of insulin-producing β cells during development in gnotobiotic zebrafish and mice. BefA disseminates systemically by multiple anatomic routes to act directly on pancreatic islets. We detail BefA’s atomic structure, containing a lipid-binding SYLF domain, and demonstrate that it permeabilizes synthetic liposomes and bacterial membranes. A BefA mutant impaired in membrane disruption fails to expand β cells, whereas the pore-forming host defense protein, Reg3, stimulates β cell proliferation. Our work demonstrates that membrane permeabilization by microbiome-derived and host defense proteins is necessary and sufficient for β cell expansion during pancreas development, potentially connecting microbiome composition with diabetes risk.

Abstract: The de-methylesterification of the pectic polysaccharide homogalacturonan (HG) by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) is a critical step in the control of plant cell expansion and morphogenesis. Plants have large gene families encoding PMEs but also PME inhibitors (PMEIs) with differ in their biochemical properties. The Arabidopsis thaliana PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR 3 (PMEI3) gene is frequently used as a tool to manipulate pectin methylesterase activity in studies assessing its role in the control of morphogenesis. One limitation of these studies is that the exact biochemical activity of this protein has not yet been determined. In this manuscript we produced the protein in Pichia pastoris and characterized its activity in vitro. Like other PMEIs, PMEI3 inhibits PME activity at acidic pH in a variety of cell wall extracts and in purified PME preparations, but does not affect the much stronger PME activity at neutral pH. The protein is remarkable heat stable and shows higher activity against PME3 than against PME2, illustrating how different members of the large PMEI family can differ in their specificities towards PME targets. Finally, growing Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings in the presence of purified PMEI3 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of root growth associated with the overall inhibition of HG de-methylesterification of the root surface. This suggests an essential in vivo role for PME activity at acidic pH in HG de-methylesterification and growth control. These results show that purified recombinant PMEI3 is a powerful tool to study the connection between pectin de-methylesterification and cell expansion.

Abstract: Summary
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a major cause of acute respiratory infections in infants and older adults, for which no vaccines or therapeutics are available. The viral fusion (F) glycoprotein is required for entry and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies; however, little is known about the humoral immune response generated from natural infection. Here, using prefusion-stabilized F proteins to interrogate memory B cells from two older adults, we obtain over 700 paired non-IgM antibody sequences representing 563 clonotypes, indicative of a highly polyclonal response. Characterization of 136 monoclonal antibodies reveals broad recognition of the protein surface, with potently neutralizing antibodies targeting each antigenic site. Cryo-EM studies further reveal two non-canonical sites and the molecular basis for recognition of the apex of hMPV F by two prefusion-specific neutralizing antibodies. Collectively, these results provide insight into the humoral response to hMPV infection in older adults and will help guide vaccine development.

Abstract: The target of rapamycin complex (TORC) plays a key role in plant cell growth and survival by regulating the gene expression and metabolism according to environmental information. TORC activates transcription, mRNA translation, and anabolic processes under favorable conditions, thereby promoting plant growth and development. Tomato fruit ripening is a complex developmental process promoted by ethylene and specific transcription factors. TORC is known to modulate leaf senescence in tomato. In this study, we investigated the function of TORC in tomato fruit ripening using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of the TORC genes, TOR, lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (LST8), and regulatory-associated protein of TOR (RAPTOR). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression levels of tomato TORC genes were the highest in the orange stage during fruit development in Micro-Tom tomato. VIGS of these TORC genes using stage 2 tomato accelerated fruit ripening with premature orange/red coloring and decreased fruit growth, when control tobacco rattle virus 2 (TRV2)-myc fruits reached the mature green stage. TORC-deficient fruits showed early accumulation of carotenoid lycopene and reduced cellulose deposition in pericarp cell walls. The early ripening fruits had higher levels of transcripts related to fruit ripening transcription factors, ethylene biosynthesis, carotenoid synthesis, and cell wall modification. Finally, the early ripening phenotype in Micro-Tom tomato was reproduced in the commercial cultivar Moneymaker tomato by VIGS of the TORC genes. Collectively, these results demonstrate that TORC plays an important role in tomato fruit ripening by modulating the transcription of various ripening-related genes.

Abstract: The immunogenicity of Candida albicans cells is influenced by changes in the exposure of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) on the fungal cell surface. Previously, the degree of exposure on the C. albicans cell surface of the immunoinflammatory MAMP β-(1,3)-glucan was shown to correlate inversely with colonisation levels in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This is important because life-threatening systemic candidiasis in critically ill patients often arises from translocation of C. albicans strains present in the patient’s GI tract. Therefore, using a murine model, we have examined the impact of gut-related factors upon β-glucan exposure and colonisation levels in the GI tract. The degree of β-glucan exposure was examined by imaging flow cytometry of C. albicans cells taken directly from GI compartments, and compared with colonisation levels. Fungal β-glucan exposure was lower in the cecum than the small intestine, and fungal burdens were correspondingly higher in the cecum. This inverse correlation did not hold for the large intestine. The gut fermentation acid, lactate, triggers β-glucan masking in vitro, leading to attenuated anti-Candida immune responses. Additional fermentation acids are present in the GI tract, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. We show that these acids also influence β-glucan exposure on C. albicans cells in vitro and, like lactate, they influence β-glucan exposure via Gpr1/Gpa2-mediated signalling. Significantly, C. albicans gpr1Δ gpa2Δ cells displayed elevated β-glucan exposure in the large intestine and a corresponding decrease in fungal burden, consistent with the idea that Gpr1/Gpa2-mediated β-glucan masking influences colonisation of this GI compartment. Finally, extracts from the murine gut and culture supernatants from the mannan grazing gut anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron promote β-glucan exposure at the C. albicans cell surface. Therefore, the local microbiota influences β-glucan exposure levels directly (via mannan grazing) and indirectly (via fermentation acids), whilst β-glucan masking appears to promote C. albicans colonisation of the murine large intestine.

Abstract: 2-(4-morpholinoethyl)− 1-phenylcyclohexane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride (PRE-084) is a selective sigma 1 receptor agonist. It has been shown that PRE-084 protected various tissues from experimental injury. However, no reports are available on its effect on renal fibrosis. Rat model of adenine-induced chronic kidney disease was chosen to study this. Adenine feeding in rats caused renal dysfunction as shown by increased serum creatinine and reduced creatinine clearance along with increased high molecular weight (HMW) urine protein excretion. Further, adenine feeding induced profibrotic changes in the kidney as reflected by increased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibroblast specific protein-1 (FSP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity; reduced cytokeratin expression. Further, there was excess deposition of extracellular matrix in the kidney, a striking character of fibrosis. However, administration of PRE-084 to adenine fed rats led to reduction in creatinine and proteinuria parameters partly. This was accompanied by reduced expression of α-SMA, FSP-1 and MMP-2 activity and slight restoration of cytokeratin levels leading to reduced extracellular matrix deposition in the kidney. These data demonstrate that PRE-084 partly ameliorated renal dysfunction and exhibited anti-fibrotic potential in the kidney of adenine fed rats.

Abstract: Summary
Precursors of the adult hematopoietic system arise from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region shortly after the embryonic circulation is established. Here, we develop a microfluidic culture system to mimic the primitive embryonic circulation and address the hypothesis that circulatory flow and shear stress enhance embryonic blood development. Embryonic (HOXA+) hematopoiesis was derived from human pluripotent stem cells and induced from mesoderm by small-molecule manipulation of TGF-β and WNT signaling (SB/CHIR). Microfluidic and orbital culture promoted the formation of proliferative CD34+RUNX1C-GFP+SOX17-mCHERRY+ precursor cells that were released into the artificial circulation from SOX17+ arterial-like structures. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis delineated extra-embryonic (yolk sac) and HOXA+ embryonic blood differentiation pathways. SB/CHIR and circulatory flow enhance hematopoiesis by the formation of proliferative HOXA+RUNX1C+CD34+ precursor cells that differentiate into monocyte/macrophage, granulocyte, erythrocyte, and megakaryocyte progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Type 2 diabetes with obesity-related insulin resistance as the main manifestation is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Adipose tissue plays an important role in this process. Here, we demonstrated that adipose tissue-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo microRNAs (miRNAs) mediate inter-organ communication between adipose tissue and the brain, which can be transferred into the brain in a membrane protein-dependent manner and enriched in neurons, especially in the hippocampus. Further investigation suggests that adipose tissue-derived EVs from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice or patients with diabetes induce remarkable synaptic loss and cognitive impairment. Depletion of miRNA cargo in these EVs significantly alleviates their detrimental effects on cognitive function. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting adipose tissue-derived EVs or their cargo miRNAs may provide a promising strategy for pharmaceutical interventions for cognitive impairment in diabetes.

Abstract: A long-term energy nutritional imbalance fundamentally causes the development of obesity and associated fat accumulation. Lysosomes, as nutrient-sensing and lipophagy centers, critically control cellular lipid catabolism in response to nutrient deprivation. However, whether lysosome activity is directly involved in nutrient-induced fat accumulation remains unclear. In this study, worm fat accumulation was induced by 1 mM glucose or 0.02 mM palmitic acid supplementation. Along with the elevation of fat accumulation, lysosomal number and acidification were also increased, suggesting that lysosome activity might be correlated with nutrient-induced fat deposition in Caenorhabditis elegans. Furthermore, treatments with the lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine and leupeptin significantly reduced basal and nutrient-induced fat accumulation in C. elegans. The knockdown of hlh-30, which is a critical gene in lysosomal biogenesis, also resulted in worm fat loss. Finally, the mutation of aak-2, daf-15, and rsks-1 showed that mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1) signaling mediated the effects of lysosomes on basal and nutrient-induced fat accumulation in C. elegans. Overall, this study reveals the previously undescribed role of lysosomes in overnutrition sensing, suggesting a new strategy for controlling body fat accumulation.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrence of solid tumors renders patients vulnerable to advanced, treatment-refractory disease state with mutational and oncogenic landscape distinctive from initial diagnosis. Improving outcomes for recurrent cancers requires a better understanding of cell populations that expand from the post-therapy, minimal residual disease (MRD) state. We profile barcoded tumor stem cell populations through therapy at tumor initiation, MRD, and recurrence in our therapy-adapted, patient-derived xenograft models of glioblastoma (GBM). Tumors show distinct patterns of recurrence in which clonal populations exhibit either a pre-existing fitness advantage or an equipotency fitness acquired through therapy. Characterization of the MRD state by single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing reveals a tumor-intrinsic immunomodulatory signature with prognostic significance at the transcriptomic level and in proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from patients with GBM. Our results provide insight into the innate and therapy-driven dynamics of human GBM and the prognostic value of interrogating the MRD state in solid cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Macroautophagy is a bulk degradation system in which double membrane-bound structures called autophagosomes to deliver cytosolic materials to lysosomes. Autophagy promotes cellular homeostasis by selectively recognizing and sequestering specific targets, such as damaged organelles, protein aggregates, and invading bacteria, termed selective autophagy. We previously reported a type of selective autophagy, lysophagy, which helps clear damaged lysosomes. Damaged lysosomes become ubiquitinated and recruit autophagic machinery. Proteomic studies using transfection reagent-coated beads and further evaluations reveal that a CUL4A-DDB1-WDFY1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is essential to initiate lysophagy and clear damaged lysosomes. Moreover, we show that LAMP2 is ubiquitinated by the CUL4A E3 ligase complex as a substrate on damaged lysosomes. These results reveal how cells selectively tag damaged lysosomes to initiate autophagy for the clearance of lysosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Suppressive myeloid cells can contribute to immunotherapy resistance, but their role in response to checkpoint inhibition (CPI) in anti-PD-1 refractory cancers, such as biliary tract cancer (BTC), remains elusive. We use multiplexed single-cell transcriptomic and epitope sequencing to profile greater than 200,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from advanced BTC patients (n = 9) and matched healthy donors (n = 8). Following anti-PD-1 treatment, CD14+ monocytes expressing high levels of immunosuppressive cytokines and chemotactic molecules (CD14CTX) increase in the circulation of patients with BTC tumors that are CPI resistant. CD14CTX can directly suppress CD4+ T cells and induce SOCS3 expression in CD4+ T cells, rendering them functionally unresponsive. The CD14CTX gene signature associates with worse survival in patients with BTC as well as in other anti-PD-1 refractory cancers. These results demonstrate that monocytes arising after anti-PD-1 treatment can induce T cell paralysis as a distinct mode of tumor-mediated immunosuppression leading to CPI resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The hypothalamus is key in the control of energy balance. However, strategies targeting hypothalamic neurons have failed to provide viable options to treat most metabolic diseases. Conversely, the role of astrocytes in systemic metabolic control has remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that obesity promotes anatomically restricted remodeling of hypothalamic astrocyte activity. In the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, chemogenetic manipulation of astrocytes results in bidirectional control of neighboring neuron activity, autonomic outflow, glucose metabolism, and energy balance. This process recruits a mechanism involving the astrocytic control of ambient glutamate levels, which becomes defective in obesity. Positive or negative chemogenetic manipulation of PVN astrocyte Ca2+ signals, respectively, worsens or improves metabolic status of diet-induced obese mice. Collectively, these findings highlight a yet unappreciated role for astrocytes in the direct control of systemic metabolism and suggest potential targets for anti-obesity strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Gene therapy is limited by inefficient delivery of large clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) effectors, such as Cas9 and Cas12a nucleases. Cas12f nucleases are currently one of the most compact CRISPR genome editors. However, the available toolkit of efficient Cas12f editors is limited. Here, we report the characterization and engineering of a miniature CRISPR-Cas12f system from Syntrophomonas palmitatica (SpaCas12f1, 497 amino acids). We show that CRISPR-SpaCas12f1 cleaves double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with 5′ T-rich PAM specificity and is naturally active for genome editing in bacteria. We identify that CRISPR-SpaCas12f1 trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) harbors a unique head-to-toe hairpin structure, and the natural hairpin structure is a key factor in restricting genome editing by SpaCas12f1 in human cells. Systematical engineering of SpaCas12f1 guide RNA transforms CRISPR-SpaCas12f1 into an efficient genome editor comparable to Francisella novicida CRISPR-Cas12a. Our findings expand the mini CRISPR toolbox, paving the way for therapeutic applications of CRISPR-SpaCas12f1 and engineering compact genome manipulation technologies.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-blockade immunotherapies have limited efficacy in the treatment of bladder cancer. Here, we show that NKG2A associates with improved survival and responsiveness to PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy in bladder tumors that have high abundance of CD8+ T cells. In bladder tumors, NKG2A is acquired on CD8+ T cells later than PD-1 as well as other well-established immune checkpoints. NKG2A+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cells diverge from classically defined exhausted T cells through their ability to react to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-deficient tumors using T cell receptor (TCR)-independent innate-like mechanisms. HLA-ABC expression by bladder tumors is progressively diminished as disease progresses, framing the importance of targeting TCR-independent anti-tumor functions. Notably, NKG2A+ CD8+ T cells are inhibited when HLA-E is expressed by tumors and partly restored upon NKG2A blockade in an HLA-E-dependent manner. Overall, our study provides a framework for subsequent clinical trials combining NKG2A blockade with other T cell-targeted immunotherapies, where tumors express higher levels of HLA-E.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a unique niche governed by constant crosstalk within and across all intratumoral cellular compartments. In particular, intratumoral high potassium (K+) has shown immune-suppressive potency on T cells. However, as a pan-cancer characteristic associated with local necrosis, the impact of this ionic disturbance on innate immunity is unknown. Here, we reveal that intratumoral high K+ suppresses the anti-tumor capacity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We identify the inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir2.1 as a central modulator of TAM functional polarization in high K+ TME, and its conditional depletion repolarizes TAMs toward an anti-tumor state, sequentially boosting local anti-tumor immunity. Kir2.1 deficiency disturbs the electrochemically dependent glutamine uptake, engendering TAM metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis. Kir2.1 blockade attenuates both murine tumor- and patient-derived xenograft growth. Collectively, our findings reveal Kir2.1 as a determinant and potential therapeutic target for regaining the anti-tumor capacity of TAMs within ionic-imbalanced TME.

Abstract: Objectives
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a primary malignant tumour with a very bad prognosis, which develops from the mesothelial cells lining the serosal surfaces. Because MM can show a wide variety of histological patterns and its cytomorphological features are quite extensive, it is often confused with lung adenocarcinomas (LAC) and reactive mesothelial hyperplasia (RMH). The immunohistochemical examination method is the most useful method for discrimination. In this study, we aimed to determine the value of suprabasin and DARS2 markers in the differential diagnosis of RMH, MM and LAC.
Methods
Thirty MM, 30 LAC and 30 RMH samples selected from the archive of Fırat University Hospital Pathology Department Laboratory were included in this study. Suprabasin and DARS2 markers were applied to the samples immunohistochemically and their place in the differential diagnosis was examined.
Results
Although DARS2 expression was observed in RMH, MM and adenocarcinoma samples, Suprabasin expression was only observed in adenocarcinoma. There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of DARS2 and Suprabasin expression. No suprabasin expression was detected in MM and RMH.
Conclusion
Suprabasin and DARS2 may be proposed as new biomarkers to differentiate MM from LAC.

Abstract: Summary
Yamanaka factors are essential for establishing pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, but their function in multipotent stem cell populations is poorly understood. Here, we show that OCT4 and SOX2 cooperate with tissue-specific transcription factors to promote neural crest formation. By assessing avian and human neural crest cells at distinct developmental stages, we characterized the epigenomic changes that occur during their specification, migration, and early differentiation. This analysis determined that the OCT4-SOX2 dimer is required to establish a neural crest epigenomic signature that is lost upon cell fate commitment. The OCT4-SOX2 genomic targets in the neural crest differ from those of embryonic stem cells, indicating the dimer displays context-specific functions. Binding of OCT4-SOX2 to neural crest enhancers requires pioneer factor TFAP2A, which physically interacts with the dimer to modify its genomic targets. Our results demonstrate how Yamanaka factors are repurposed in multipotent cells to control chromatin organization and define their developmental potential.

Abstract: Summary
Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV) in nociceptive neurons initiate action potentials required for transmission of aberrant painful stimuli observed in osteoarthritis (OA). Targeting NaV subtypes with drugs to produce analgesic effects for OA pain management is a developing therapeutic area. Previously, we determined the receptor site for the tamoxifen analog N-desmethyltamoxifen (ND-Tam) within a prokaryotic NaV. Here, we report the pharmacology of ND-Tam against eukaryotic NaVs natively expressed in nociceptive neurons. ND-Tam and analogs occupy two conserved intracellular receptor sites in domains II and IV of NaV1.7 to block ion entry using a “bind and plug” mechanism. We find that ND-Tam inhibition of the sodium current is state dependent, conferring a potent frequency- and voltage-dependent block of hyperexcitable nociceptive neuron action potentials implicated in OA pain. When evaluated using a mouse OA pain model, ND-Tam has long-lasting efficacy, which supports the potential of repurposing ND-Tam analogs as NaV antagonists for OA pain management.

Abstract: Summary
The avian utricle, a vestibular organ of the inner ear, displays turnover of sensory hair cells throughout life. This is in sharp contrast to the mammalian utricle, which shows limited regenerative capacity. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to identify distinct marker genes for the different sensory hair cell subtypes of the chicken utricle, which we validated in situ. We provide markers for spatially distinct supporting cell populations and identify two transitional cell populations of dedifferentiating supporting cells and developing hair cells. Trajectory reconstruction resulted in an inventory of gene expression dynamics of natural hair cell generation in the avian utricle.

Abstract: Summary
Erythropoietin (Epo) ensures survival and proliferation of colony-forming unit erythroid (CFU-E) progenitor cells and their differentiation to hemoglobin-containing mature erythrocytes. A lack of Epo-induced responses causes embryonic lethality, but mechanisms regulating the dynamic communication of cellular alterations to the organismal level remain unresolved. By time-resolved transcriptomics and proteomics, we show that Epo induces in CFU-E cells a gradual transition from proliferation signature proteins to proteins indicative for differentiation, including heme-synthesis enzymes. In the absence of the Epo receptor (EpoR) in embryos, we observe a lack of hemoglobin in CFU-E cells and massive iron overload of the fetal liver pointing to a miscommunication between liver and placenta. A reduction of iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation in these embryos leads to a metabolic shift toward glycolysis. This link connecting erythropoiesis with the regulation of iron homeostasis and metabolic reprogramming suggests that balancing these interactions is crucial for protection from iron intoxication and for survival.

Abstract: Summary
We may view most of our daily activities as rational action selections; however, we sometimes reinforce maladaptive behaviors despite having explicit environmental knowledge. In this study, we model obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms as implicitly learned maladaptive behaviors. Simulations in the reinforcement learning framework show that agents implicitly learn to respond to intrusive thoughts when the memory trace signal for past actions decays differently for positive and negative prediction errors. Moreover, this model extends our understanding of therapeutic effects of behavioral therapy in OCD. Using empirical data, we confirm that patients with OCD show extremely imbalanced traces, which are normalized by serotonin enhancers. We find that healthy participants also vary in their obsessive-compulsive tendencies, consistent with the degree of imbalanced traces. These behavioral characteristics can be generalized to variations in the healthy population beyond the spectrum of clinical phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Cytotoxicity of tumor-specific T cells requires tumor cell-to-T cell contact-dependent induction of classic tumor cell apoptosis and pyroptosis. However, this may not trigger sufficient primary responses of solid tumors to adoptive cell therapy or prevent tumor antigen escape-mediated acquired resistance. Here we test myxoma virus (MYXV)-infected tumor-specific T (TMYXV) cells expressing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or T cell receptor (TCR), which systemically deliver MYXV into solid tumors to overcome primary resistance. In addition to T cell-induced apoptosis and pyroptosis, tumor eradication by CAR/TCR-TMYXV cells is also attributed to tumor cell autosis induction, a special type of cell death. Mechanistically, T cell-derived interferon γ (IFNγ)-protein kinase B (AKT) signaling synergizes with MYXV-induced M-T5-SKP-1-VPS34 signaling to trigger robust tumor cell autosis.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors with basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motifs can control neural progenitor fate determination to neurons and oligodendrocytes. How bHLH transcription factors regulate astrogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we report that NPAS3, a bHLH transcription factor, is a critical regulator of astrogenesis. Npas3 deficiency impairs cortical astrogenesis, correlating with abnormal brain development and autistic-like behaviors. Single-cell transcriptomes reveal that Npas3 knockout induces abnormal transition states in the differentiation trajectories from radial glia to astrocytes. Analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data in primary cortical astrocytes shows that NPAS3 binding targets are involved in functions of brain development and synapse organization. Co-culture assay further indicates that NPAS3-impaired astrogenesis induces synaptic deficits in wild-type neurons. Astrocyte-specific knockdown of NPAS3 in wild-type cortex causes synaptic and behavioral abnormalities associated with the core symptoms in autism. Together, our findings suggest that transcription factor NPAS3 regulates astrogenesis and its subsequent consequences for brain development and behavior.

Abstract: Summary
The research article describing the discovery of ribosomal frameshifting in the bacterial CopA gene also reported the occurrence of frameshifting in the expression of the human ortholog ATP7B based on assays using dual luciferase reporters. An examination of the publicly available ribosome profiling data and the phylogenetic analysis of the proposed frameshifting site cast doubt on the validity of this claim and prompted us to reexamine the evidence. We observed similar apparent frameshifting efficiencies as the original authors using the same type of vector that synthesizes both luciferases as a single polyprotein. However, we noticed anomalously low absolute luciferase activities from the N-terminal reporter that suggests interference of reporter activity or levels by the ATP7B test cassette. When we tested the same proposed ATP7B frameshifting cassette in a more recently developed reporter system in which the reporters are released without being included in a polyprotein, no frameshifting was detected above background levels.

Abstract: Summary
DNA becomes single stranded (ssDNA) during replication, transcription, and repair. Transiently formed ssDNA segments can adopt alternative conformations, including cruciforms, triplexes, and quadruplexes. To determine whether there are stable regions of ssDNA in the human genome, we utilized S1-END-seq to convert ssDNA regions to DNA double-strand breaks, which were then processed for high-throughput sequencing. This approach revealed two predominant non-B DNA structures: cruciform DNA formed by expanded (TA)n repeats that accumulate in microsatellite unstable human cancer cell lines and DNA triplexes (H-DNA) formed by homopurine/homopyrimidine mirror repeats common across a variety of cell lines. We show that H-DNA is enriched during replication, that its genomic location is highly conserved, and that H-DNA formed by (GAA)n repeats can be disrupted by treatment with a (GAA)n-binding polyamide. Finally, we show that triplex-forming repeats are hotspots for mutagenesis. Our results identify dynamic DNA secondary structures in vivo that contribute to elevated genome instability.

Abstract: Summary
Each severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant renews concerns about decreased vaccine neutralization weakening efficacy. However, while prevention of infection varies, protection from disease remains and implicates immunity beyond neutralization in vaccine efficacy. Polyclonal antibodies function through Fab domains that neutralize virus and Fc domains that induce non-neutralizing responses via engagement of Fc receptors on immune cells. To understand how vaccines promote protection, we leverage sera from 51 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals after two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. We show that neutralizing activities against clinical isolates of wild-type and five SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron BA.2, link to FcγRIIIa/CD16 non-neutralizing effector functions. This is associated with post-translational afucosylation and sialylation of vaccine-specific antibodies. Further, polyfunctional neutralizing and non-neutralizing breadth, magnitude, and coordination diminish with age. Thus, studying Fc functions in addition to Fab-mediated neutralization provides greater insight into vaccine efficacy for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, against SARS-CoV-2 and novel variants.

Abstract: Summary
Functional implication of stromal heterogeneity in the prostate remains incompletely understood. Using lineage tracing and light-sheet imaging, we show that some fibroblast cells at the mouse proximal prostatic ducts and prostatic urethra highly express Lgr5. Genetic ablation of these anatomically restricted stromal cells, but not nonselective ablation of prostatic stromal cells, rapidly induces prostate epithelial turnover and dedifferentiation that are reversed following spontaneous restoration of the Lgr5+ stromal cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis indicates that ablating the Lgr5+ stromal cells activates a mechanosensory response. Ablating the Lgr5+ stromal cells impairs the control of prostatic ductal outlet, increases prostate tissue stiffness, and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Suppressing MAPK overrides the elevated epithelial proliferation. In summary, the Lgr5+ stromal cells regulate prostate tissue homeostasis and maintain its functional integrity in a long-distance manner. Our study implies that the cells at organ junctions most likely control organ homeostasis by sustaining a balanced mechanoforce.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is deposited co-transcriptionally on thousands of cellular mRNAs and plays important roles in mRNA processing and cellular function. m6A is particularly abundant within the brain and is critical for neurodevelopment. However, the mechanisms through which m6A contributes to brain development are incompletely understood. RBM45 acts as an m6A-binding protein that is highly expressed during neurodevelopment. We find that RBM45 binds to thousands of cellular RNAs, predominantly within intronic regions. Rbm45 depletion disrupts the constitutive splicing of a subset of target pre-mRNAs, leading to altered mRNA and protein levels through both m6A-dependent and m6A-independent mechanisms. Finally, we find that RBM45 is necessary for neuroblastoma cell differentiation and that its depletion impacts the expression of genes involved in several neurodevelopmental signaling pathways. Altogether, our findings show a role for RBM45 in controlling mRNA processing and neuronal differentiation, mediated in part by the recognition of methylated RNA.

Abstract: Summary
The signaling events controlling proliferation, survival, and apoptosis during mammary epithelial acinar morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. By imaging single-cell ERK activity dynamics in MCF10A acini, we find that these fates depend on the average frequency of non-periodic ERK pulses. High pulse frequency is observed during initial acinus growth, correlating with rapid cell motility and proliferation. Subsequent decrease in motility correlates with lower ERK pulse frequency and quiescence. Later, during lumen formation, coordinated multicellular ERK waves emerge, correlating with high and low ERK pulse frequencies in outer surviving and inner dying cells, respectively. Optogenetic entrainment of ERK pulses causally connects high ERK pulse frequency with inner cell survival. Acini harboring the PIK3CA H1047R mutation display increased ERK pulse frequency and inner cell survival. Thus, fate decisions during acinar morphogenesis are coordinated by different spatiotemporal modalities of ERK pulse frequency.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the splicing factor SF3B1 are frequently occurring in various cancers and drive tumor progression through the activation of cryptic splice sites in multiple genes. Recent studies also demonstrate a positive correlation between the expression levels of wild-type SF3B1 and tumor malignancy. Here, we demonstrate that SF3B1 is a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 target gene that positively regulates HIF1 pathway activity. By physically interacting with HIF1α, SF3B1 facilitates binding of the HIF1 complex to hypoxia response elements (HREs) to activate target gene expression. To further validate the relevance of this mechanism for tumor progression, we show that a reduction in SF3B1 levels via monoallelic deletion of Sf3b1 impedes tumor formation and progression via impaired HIF signaling in a mouse model for pancreatic cancer. Our work uncovers an essential role of SF3B1 in HIF1 signaling, thereby providing a potential explanation for the link between high SF3B1 expression and aggressiveness of solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication is a complex process tightly regulated to ensure faithful genome duplication, and its perturbation leads to DNA damage and genomic instability. Replication stress is commonly associated with slow and stalled replication forks. Recently, accelerated replication has emerged as a non-canonical form of replication stress. However, the molecular basis underlying fork acceleration is largely unknown. Here, we show that mutated HRAS activation leads to increased topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) expression, causing aberrant replication fork acceleration and DNA damage by decreasing RNA-DNA hybrids or R-loops. In these cells, restoration of TOP1 expression or mild replication inhibition rescues the perturbed replication and reduces DNA damage. Furthermore, TOP1 or RNaseH1 overexpression induces accelerated replication and DNA damage, highlighting the importance of TOP1 equilibrium in regulating R-loop homeostasis to ensure faithful DNA replication and genome integrity. Altogether, our results dissect a mechanism of oncogene-induced DNA damage by aberrant replication fork acceleration.

Abstract: Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality in digestive system all over the world. USP21 has been discovered to be dys-expressed to exhibit vital roles in multifarious cancers. However, its role and molecular mechanisms in EC are not elucidated. In this work, it was demonstrated that USP21 expression was up-regulated in ECSA tissues through UALCAN and TIMER databases. Additionally, through IHC assay and western blot, it was further identified that USP21 exhibited higher expression in EC tissues and cells. Further investigations illustrated that USP21 facilitated cell proliferation and glycolysis in EC. Next, the influences of USP21 on the STAT3/FOXO1 pathway in EC were investigated. We discovered that USP21 modulated the STAT3/FOXO1 pathway, and the decreased cell proliferation and glycolysis mediated by USP21 knockdown could be rescued by FOXO1 inhibition. At last, USP21 aggravated tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, our work was the first time to probe the potential function and regulatory mechanism of USP21 in EC, and these above findings manifested that USP21 accelerated the proliferation and glycolysis of EC cells through regulating the STAT3/FOXO1 pathway. This discovery implied that USP21 may be a promising prognostic and therapeutic biomarker for EC patients.

Abstract: Summary
Despite being more transmissible, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant only causes milder diseases in laboratory animals, often accompanied by a lower viral load compared with previous variants of concern. In this study, we report the structural basis for a robust interaction between the receptor-binding domain of the Omicron spike protein and mouse ACE2. We show that pseudovirus bearing the Omicron spike protein efficiently utilizes mouse ACE2 for entry. By comparing viral load and disease severity among laboratory mice infected by a natural Omicron variant or recombinant ancestral viruses bearing either the entire Omicron spike or only the N501Y/Q493R mutations in its spike, we find that mutations outside the spike protein in the Omicron variant may be responsible for the observed lower viral load. Together, our results imply that a post-entry block to the Omicron variant exists in laboratory mice.

Abstract: Summary
Germline mutations in the BRCA genes are associated with a higher risk of carcinogenesis, which is linked to an increased mutation rate and loss of the second unaffected BRCA allele (loss of heterozygosity, LOH). However, the mechanisms triggering mutagenesis are not clearly understood. The BRCA genes contain high numbers of repetitive DNA sequences. We detected replication forks stalling, DNA breaks, and deletions at these sites in haploinsufficient BRCA cells, thus identifying the BRCA genes as fragile sites. Next, we found that stalled forks are repaired by error-prone pathways, such as microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) in haploinsufficient BRCA1 breast epithelial cells. We detected MMBIR mutations in BRCA1 tumor cells and noticed deletions-insertions (>50 bp) at the BRCA1 genes in BRCA1 patients. Altogether, these results suggest that under stress, error-prone repair of stalled forks is upregulated and induces mutations, including complex genomic rearrangements at the BRCA genes (LOH), in haploinsufficient BRCA1 cells.

Abstract: Summary
The complex architecture of the murine fetus originates from a simple ball of pluripotent epiblast cells, which initiate morphogenesis upon implantation. In turn, this establishes an intermediate state of tissue-scale organization of the embryonic lineage in the form of an epithelial monolayer, where patterning signals delineate the body plan. However, how this major morphogenetic process is orchestrated on a cellular level and synchronized with the developmental progression of the epiblast is still obscure. Here, we identified that the small GTPase Rap1 plays a critical role in reshaping the pluripotent lineage. We found that Rap1 activity is controlled via Oct4/Esrrb input and is required for the transmission of polarization cues, which enables the de novo epithelialization and formation of tricellular junctions in the epiblast. Thus, Rap1 acts as a molecular switch that coordinates the morphogenetic program in the embryonic lineage, in sync with the cellular states of pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Phase separation can concentrate biomolecules and accelerate reactions. However, the mechanisms and principles connecting this mesoscale organization to signaling dynamics are difficult to dissect because of the pleiotropic effects associated with disrupting endogenous condensates. To address this limitation, we engineered new phosphorylation reactions within synthetic condensates. We generally found increased activity and broadened kinase specificity. Phosphorylation dynamics within condensates were rapid and could drive cell-cycle-dependent localization changes. High client concentration within condensates was important but not the main factor for efficient phosphorylation. Rather, the availability of many excess client-binding sites together with a flexible scaffold was crucial. Phosphorylation within condensates was also modulated by changes in macromolecular crowding. Finally, the phosphorylation of the Alzheimer’s-disease-associated protein Tau by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 was accelerated within condensates. Thus, condensates enable new signaling connections and can create sensors that respond to the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm.

Abstract: Summary
The Taiwan Biobank (TWB) is an ongoing prospective study of >150,000 individuals aged 20–70 in Taiwan. A comprehensive list of phenotypes was collected for each consented participant at recruitment and follow-up visits through structured interviews and physical measurements. Biomarkers and genetic data were generated from blood and urine samples. We present here an overview of TWB’s genetic data quality, population structure, and familial relationship, which consists of predominantly Han Chinese ancestry, and highlight its important attributes and genetic findings thus far. A linkage to Taiwan’s National Health Insurance database of >25 years and other registries is underway to enrich the phenotypic spectrum and enable deep and longitudinal genetic investigations. TWB provides one of the largest biobank resources for biomedical and public health research in East Asia that will contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of health and disease in global populations through collaborative studies with other biobanks.

Abstract: Summary
Deficits in mitochondrial transport are a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated whether loss of components of the mitochondrial transport machinery impinge directly on metabolic stress, neuronal death, and circuit dysfunction. Using multiphoton microscope live imaging, we showed that ocular hypertension, a major risk factor in glaucoma, disrupts mitochondria anterograde axonal transport leading to energy decline in vulnerable neurons. Gene- and protein-expression analysis revealed loss of the adaptor disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (Disc1) in retinal neurons subjected to high intraocular pressure. Disc1 gene delivery was sufficient to rescue anterograde transport and replenish axonal mitochondria. A genetically encoded ATP sensor combined with longitudinal live imaging showed that Disc1 supplementation increased ATP production in stressed neurons. Disc1 gene therapy promotes neuronal survival, reverses abnormal single-cell calcium dynamics, and restores visual responses. Our study demonstrates that enhancing anterograde mitochondrial transport is an effective strategy to alleviate metabolic stress and neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria and plastids power complex life. Why some genes and not others are retained in their organelle DNA (oDNA) genomes remains a debated question. Here, we attempt to identify the properties of genes and associated underlying mechanisms that determine oDNA retention. We harness over 15k oDNA sequences and over 300 whole genome sequences across eukaryotes with tools from structural biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and Bayesian model selection. Previously hypothesized features, including the hydrophobicity of a protein product, and less well-known features, including binding energy centrality within a protein complex, predict oDNA retention across eukaryotes, with additional influences of nucleic acid and amino acid biochemistry. Notably, the same features predict retention in both organelles, and retention models learned from one organelle type quantitatively predict retention in the other, supporting the universality of these features—which also distinguish gene profiles in more recent, independent endosymbiotic relationships. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Introduction
Metastasis to the thyroid gland is a rare condition that can pose diagnostic difficulties. The purpose of the present study was to provide an overview of non-thyroid tumors metastasizing to the thyroid based on our institutional experience.
Material and method
The data of the study were obtained by using the pathology database investigating patients diagnosed with tumor metastasis to° the thyroid between 2013 and 2022 at Firat University Hospital and reviewing their medical files.
Results
As a result of histochemical and immunohistochemical examinations of the thyroid, seven patients were diagnosed with tumor metastasis. Of the seven patients, 3 (42.85%) were female and 4 (57.14%) were male. The median age at which thyroid metastases were detected was 60.71 (52−80). The most common metastatic thyroid tumors of primary origin were kidney (28.5%), lung (28.5%), head and neck malignancies (28.5%) and unknown primary tumors (14.5%). The median time from diagnosis of primary tumor to diagnosis of thyroid metastasis was 26 months (12−36). The longest survival was determined in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and the shortest survival was determined in lung cancer.
Conclusion
Thyroidal metastases are rare; however, they must be suspected in patients with a previous history of non-thyroid malignancy and a thyroid nodule. The prognosis is quite poor and the overall survival of the patient depends on the type and location of the primary tumor. The most common primary tumors metastasizing to the thyroid are kidney, lung, and head and neck malignancies, and surgery/chemotherapy may be beneficial.

Abstract: Summary
Despite therapeutic interventions for glioblastoma (GBM), cancer stem cells (CSCs) drive recurrence. The precise mechanisms underlying CSC resistance, namely inhibition of cell death, are unclear. We built on previous observations that the high cell surface expression of junctional adhesion molecule-A drives CSC maintenance and identified downstream signaling networks, including the cysteine protease inhibitor SerpinB3. Using genetic depletion approaches, we found that SerpinB3 is necessary for CSC maintenance, survival, and tumor growth, as well as CSC pathway activation. Knockdown of SerpinB3 also increased apoptosis and susceptibility to radiation therapy. SerpinB3 was essential to buffer cathepsin L-mediated cell death, which was enhanced with radiation. Finally, we found that SerpinB3 knockdown increased the efficacy of radiation in pre-clinical models. Taken together, our findings identify a GBM CSC-specific survival mechanism involving a cysteine protease inhibitor, SerpinB3, and provide a potential target to improve the efficacy of GBM therapies against therapeutically resistant CSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-27 (IL-27) uniquely assembles p28 and EBI3 subunits to a heterodimeric cytokine that signals via IL-27Rα and gp130. To provide the structural framework for receptor activation by IL-27 and its emerging therapeutic targeting, we report here crystal structures of mouse IL-27 in complex with IL-27Rα and of human IL-27 in complex with SRF388, a monoclonal antibody undergoing clinical trials with oncology indications. One face of the helical p28 subunit interacts with EBI3, while the opposite face nestles into the interdomain elbow of IL-27Rα to juxtapose IL-27Rα to EBI3. This orients IL-27Rα for paired signaling with gp130, which only uses its immunoglobulin domain to bind to IL-27. Such a signaling complex is distinct from those mediated by IL-12 and IL-23. The SRF388 binding epitope on IL-27 overlaps with the IL-27Rα interaction site explaining its potent antagonistic properties. Collectively, our findings will facilitate the mechanistic interrogation, engineering, and therapeutic targeting of IL-27.

Abstract: Summary
In everyday life, we mentally represent possible consequences of our behaviors and integrate specific outcome values into existing knowledge to inform decisions. The medial orbitofrontal cortex (MO) is necessary to adapt behaviors when outcomes are not immediately available—when they and their values need to be envisioned. Nevertheless, neurobiological mechanisms remain unclear. We find that the neuroplasticity-associated neurotrophin receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) is necessary for mice to integrate outcome-specific value information into choice behavior. This function appears attributable to memory updating (and not retrieval) and the stabilization of dendritic spines on excitatory MO neurons, which led us to investigate inputs to the MO. Ventral hippocampal (vHC)-to-MO projections appear conditionally necessary for value updating, involved in long-term aversion-based value memory updating. Furthermore, vHC-MO-mediated control of choice is TrkB dependent. Altogether, we reveal a vHC-MO connection by which specific value memories are updated, and we position TrkB within this functional circuit.

Abstract: Summary
Cells can respond to stalled ribosomes by sensing ribosome collisions and employing quality control pathways. How ribosome stalling is resolved without collisions, however, has remained elusive. Here, focusing on noncolliding stalling exhibited by decoding-defective ribosomes, we identified Fap1 as a stalling sensor triggering 18S nonfunctional rRNA decay via polyubiquitination of uS3. Ribosome profiling revealed an enrichment of Fap1 at the translation initiation site but also an association with elongating individual ribosomes. Cryo-EM structures of Fap1-bound ribosomes elucidated Fap1 probing the mRNA simultaneously at both the entry and exit channels suggesting an mRNA stasis sensing activity, and Fap1 sterically hinders the formation of canonical collided di-ribosomes. Our findings indicate that individual stalled ribosomes are the potential signal for ribosome dysfunction, leading to accelerated turnover of the ribosome itself.

Abstract: Summary
Despite a strong genetic component, only a few genes have been identified in congenital heart diseases (CHDs). We introduced systems analyses to uncover the hidden organization on biological networks of mutations in CHDs and leveraged network analysis to integrate the protein interactome, patient exomes, and single-cell transcriptomes of the developing heart. We identified a CHD network regulating heart development and observed that a sub-network also regulates fetal brain development, thereby providing mechanistic insights into the clinical comorbidities between CHDs and neurodevelopmental conditions. At a small scale, we experimentally verified uncharacterized cardiac functions of several proteins. At a global scale, our study revealed developmental dynamics of the network and observed its association with the hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), which was further supported by the dysregulation of the network in HLHS endothelial cells. Overall, our work identified previously uncharacterized CHD factors and provided a generalizable framework applicable to studying many other complex diseases. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are the most abundant cellular RNAs, and their synthesis from rDNA repeats by RNA polymerase I accounts for the bulk of all transcription. Despite substantial variation in rRNA transcription rates across cell types, little is known about cell-type-specific factors that bind rDNA and regulate rRNA transcription to meet tissue-specific needs. Using hematopoiesis as a model system, we mapped about 2,200 ChIP-seq datasets for 250 transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin proteins to human and mouse rDNA and identified robust binding of multiple TF families to canonical TF motifs on rDNA. Using a 47S-FISH-Flow assay developed for nascent rRNA quantification, we demonstrated that targeted degradation of C/EBP alpha (CEBPA), a critical hematopoietic TF with conserved rDNA binding, caused rapid reduction in rRNA transcription due to reduced RNA Pol I occupancy. Our work identifies numerous potential rRNA regulators and provides a template for dissection of TF roles in rRNA transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Human chromosomes are pervasively transcribed, but systematic understanding of coding and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genome function in cell differentiation is lacking. Using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in human induced pluripotent stem cells, we performed dual genome-wide screens—assessing 18,905 protein-coding and 10,678 lncRNA loci—and identified 419 coding and 201 lncRNA genes that regulate neural induction. Integrative analyses revealed distinct properties of coding and lncRNA genome function, including a 10-fold enrichment of lncRNA genes for roles in differentiation compared with proliferation. Further, we applied CRISPRi perturbation coupled with single-cell RNA-seq (Perturb-seq) to obtain granular insights into neural induction phenotypes. While most coding hits stalled or aborted differentiation, lncRNA hits were enriched for the genesis of diverse cellular states, including those outside the neural lineage. In addition to providing a rich resource for understanding coding and lncRNA gene function in development, these results indicate that the lncRNA genome regulates lineage commitment in a manner fundamentally distinct from coding genes.

Abstract: The organ pancreas is characteristic of all vertebrates, but its evolutionary origin remains largely unknown. The serine proteinases trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase are produced primarily in the pancreas in vertebrates. Here we clearly demonstrate by enzymatic activity assay, histochemical staining and in situ hybridization that trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase are widely distributed in the digestive tract of the amphioxus Branchiostoma japonicum, especially in the hepatic caecum and mid-gut. This suggests that an extensive region of the amphioxus digestive tract including the hepatic caecum is homologous to the vertebrate exocrine pancreatic cells, providing a new angle for the study of the origin and evolution of vertebrate pancreas.

Abstract: Summary
Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are rare airway cells with potential sensory capacity linked to vagal neurons and immune cells. How PNECs sense and respond to external stimuli remains poorly understood. We discovered PNECs located within pig and human submucosal glands, a tissue that produces much of the mucus that defends the lung. These PNECs sense succinate, an inflammatory molecule in liquid lining the airway surface. The results indicate that succinate migrates down the submucosal gland duct to the acinus, where it triggers apical succinate receptors, causing PNECs to release ATP. The short-range ATP signal stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells wrapped tightly around the submucosal glands. Succinate-triggered gland contraction may complement the action of neurotransmitters that induce mucus release but not gland contraction to promote mucus ejection onto the airway surface. These findings identify a local circuit in which rare PNECs within submucosal glands sense an environmental cue to orchestrate the function of airway glands.

Abstract: Summary
Recognition of pathogen-derived foreign nucleic acids is central to innate immune defense. This requires discrimination between structurally highly similar self and nonself nucleic acids to avoid aberrant inflammatory responses as in the autoinflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). How vast amounts of self RNA are shielded from immune recognition to prevent autoinflammation is not fully understood. Here, we show that human SAM-domain- and HD-domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), one of the AGS-causing genes, functions as a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) 3′exonuclease, the lack of which causes cellular RNA accumulation. Increased ssRNA in cells leads to dissolution of RNA-protein condensates, which sequester immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Release of sequestered dsRNA from condensates triggers activation of antiviral type I interferon via retinoic-acid-inducible gene I-like receptors. Our results establish SAMHD1 as a key regulator of cellular RNA homeostasis and demonstrate that buffering of immunogenic self RNA by condensates regulates innate immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Antiretroviral therapy controls, but does not cure, HIV-1 infection due to a reservoir of rare CD4+ T cells harboring latent proviruses. Little is known about the transcriptional program of latent cells. Here, we report a strategy to enrich clones of latent cells carrying intact, replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses from blood based on their expression of unique T cell receptors. Latent cell enrichment enabled single-cell transcriptomic analysis of 1,050 CD4+ T cells belonging to expanded clones harboring intact HIV-1 proviruses from 6 different individuals. The analysis reveals that most of these cells are T effector memory cells that are enriched for expression of HLA-DR, HLA-DP, CD74, CCL5, granzymes A and K, cystatin F, LYAR, and DUSP2. We conclude that expanded clones of latent cells carrying intact HIV-1 proviruses persist preferentially in a distinct CD4+ T cell population, opening possibilities for eradication.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate the ameliorative effect of urine-derived stem cells (USCs) conditioned medium on the aging retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and explore the underlying mechanism.
Methods
The RPE cells were cultured, and aging RPE models were prepared by D-galactose treatment and identified by β-Galactosidase staining. USCs were primarily cultured and identified by immunofluorescence staining. The proliferation and cell cycle of RPE cells in USCs conditioned medium (with USCs removal) were detected by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. Gene sequencing was applied to analyze the genetic variation with or without medium treatment. Bioinformatics analysis was used to investigate the biological functions of up- and downregulated differentially expressed genes after medium treatment.
Results
The cell morphology of aging RPE cells treated with the USCs medium were improved significantly and resembled normal RPE cells. In addition, the number of RPE cells increased with USCs medium, and the number of aging cells was significantly reduced after treatment with USCs medium. Moreover, the apoptosis rate of RPE cells was much lower in USCs medium group. The proportion of G1-phase RPE cells was significantly smaller and the proportion of S-phase RPE cells was significantly higher in the USCs medium group. It was found that there were 423 genes upregulated and 64 genes downregulated between the normal RPE cells and aging RPE cells, and 90 genes upregulated and 75 genes downregulated between the aging RPE cells and aging RPE cells cultured in USCs medium.
Conclusions
Our data confirmed that the USCs could positively ameliorate the aging progression of RPE cells by regulating multiple gene network.Keywords: urine-derived stem cells, retinal pigment epithelial cells, cellular senescence, bioinformatic analysis

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoiesis was considered a hierarchical stepwise process but was revised to a continuous process following single-cell RNA sequencing. However, the uncertainty or fluctuation of single-cell transcriptome dynamics during differentiation was not considered, and the dendritic cell (DC) pathway in the lymphoid context remains unclear. Here, we identify human B-plasmacytoid DC (pDC) bifurcation as large fluctuating transcriptome dynamics in the putative B/NK progenitor region by dry and wet methods. By converting splicing kinetics into diffusion dynamics in a deep generative model, our original computational methodology reveals strong fluctuation at B/pDC bifurcation in IL-7Rα+ regions, and LFA-1 fluctuates positively in the pDC direction at the bifurcation. These expectancies are validated by the presence of B/pDC progenitors in the IL-7Rα+ fraction and preferential expression of LFA-1 in pDC-biased progenitors with a niche-like culture system. We provide a model of fluctuation-based differentiation, which reconciles continuous and discrete models and is applicable to other developmental systems.

Abstract: Summary
During mammalian energy homeostasis, the glucagon receptor (Gcgr) plays a key role in regulating both glucose and lipid metabolisms. However, the mechanisms by which these distinct signaling arms are differentially regulated remain poorly understood. Using a Cy5-glucagon agonist, we show that the endosomal protein Vps37a uncouples glucose production from lipid usage downstream of Gcgr signaling by altering intracellular receptor localization. Hepatocyte-specific knockdown of Vps37a causes an accumulation of Gcgr in endosomes, resulting in overactivation of the cAMP/PKA/p-Creb signaling pathway to gluconeogenesis without affecting β-oxidation. Shifting the receptor back to the plasma membrane rescues the differential signaling and highlights the importance of the spatiotemporal localization of Gcgr for its metabolic effects. Importantly, since Vps37a knockdown in animals fed with a high-fat diet leads to hyperglycemia, although its overexpression reduces blood glucose levels, these data reveal a contribution of endosomal signaling to metabolic diseases that could be exploited for treatments of type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
The initial immune response to HIV determines transmission. However, due to technical limitations we still do not have a comparative map of early mucosal transmission events. By combining RNAscope, cyclic immunofluorescence, and image analysis tools, we quantify HIV transmission signatures in intact human colorectal explants within 2 h of topical exposure. We map HIV enrichment to mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) and submucosal macrophages, but not CD4+ T cells, the primary targets of downstream infection. HIV+ DCs accumulate near and within lymphoid aggregates, which act as early sanctuaries of high viral titers while facilitating HIV passage to the submucosa. Finally, HIV entry induces recruitment and clustering of target cells, facilitating DC- and macrophage-mediated HIV transfer and enhanced infection of CD4+ T cells. These data demonstrate a rapid response to HIV structured to maximize the likelihood of mucosal infection and provide a framework for in situ studies of host-pathogen interactions and immune-mediated pathologies.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a high mortality rate among cancers worldwide. To reduce this mortality rate, chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) or targeted therapy (bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab) has been used to treat CRC. However, due to various side effects and poor responses to CRC treatment, novel therapeutic targets for drug development are needed. In this study, we identified the overexpression of EHMT1 in CRC using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data derived from TCGA, and we observed that knocking down EHMT1 expression suppressed cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis in CRC cell lines. In Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis using RNA-seq data, apoptosis-related terms were enriched after EHMT1 knockdown. Moreover, we identified the CHOP gene as a direct target of EHMT1 using a ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assay with an anti-histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) antibody. Finally, after cotransfection with siEHMT1 and siCHOP, we again confirmed that CHOP-mediated cell apoptosis was induced by EHMT1 knockdown. Our findings reveal that EHMT1 plays a key role in regulating CRC cell apoptosis, suggesting that EHMT1 may be a therapeutic target for the development of cancer inhibitors.

Like other pathogens, parasitic helminths can rapidly evolve resistance to drug treatment. Understanding the genetic basis of anthelmintic drug resistance in parasitic nematodes is key to tracking its spread and improving the efficacy and sustainability of parasite control. Here, we use an in vivo genetic cross between drug-susceptible and multi-drug-resistant strains of Haemonchus contortus in a natural host-parasite system to simultaneously map resistance loci for the three major classes of anthelmintics. This approach identifies new alleles for resistance to benzimidazoles and levamisole and implicates the transcription factor cky-1 in ivermectin resistance. This gene is within a locus under selection in ivermectin-resistant populations worldwide; expression analyses and functional validation using knockdown experiments support that cky-1 is associated with ivermectin survival. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of high-resolution forward genetics in a parasitic nematode and identifies variants for the development of molecular diagnostics to combat drug resistance in the field.
