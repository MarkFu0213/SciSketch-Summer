Abstract: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium manipulates cellular Rho GTPases for host cell invasion by effector protein translocation via the Type III Secretion System (T3SS). The two Guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) mimicking factors SopE and –E2 and the inositol phosphate phosphatase (PiPase) SopB activate the Rho GTPases Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA, thereby mediating bacterial invasion. S. Typhimurium lacking these three effector proteins are largely invasion-defective. Type III secretion is crucial for both early and later phases of the intracellular life of S. Typhimurium. Here we investigated whether and how the small GTPase RhoB, known to localize on endomembrane vesicles and at the invasion site of S. Typhimurium, contributes to bacterial invasion and to subsequent steps relevant for S. Typhimurium lifestyle. We show that RhoB is significantly upregulated within hours of Salmonella infection. This effect depends on the presence of the bacterial effector SopB, but does not require its phosphatase activity. Our data reveal that SopB and RhoB bind to each other, and that RhoB localizes on early phagosomes of intracellular S. Typhimurium. Whereas both SopB and RhoB promote intracellular survival of Salmonella, RhoB is specifically required for Salmonella-induced upregulation of autophagy. Finally, in the absence of RhoB, vacuolar escape and cytosolic hyper-replication of S. Typhimurium is diminished. Our findings thus uncover a role for RhoB in Salmonella-induced autophagy, which supports intracellular survival of the bacterium and is promoted through a positive feedback loop by the Salmonella effector SopB.

Abstract: Summary
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life support system that provides extracorporeal respiration and circulation. Current oxygenation membranes still face the challenges of plasma leakage, low gas exchange efficiency of O2 and CO2, and poor biocompatibility. Here, we describe the design and realization of a biomimetic Janus membrane to simulate the structural characteristics of the alveolar blood-gas barrier. The asymmetric structure is constructed by sequential assembly of a hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane layer, hydrophilic amino acid layer, and sulfonate grafting layer, which provide the functions of preventing plasma leakage, improving gas exchange performance, and maintaining biocompatibility. Importantly, the membrane can offer efficient blood oxygenation, achieving O2 and CO2 transfer rates of ∼54 and ∼131 mL m−2 min−1, respectively. This work demonstrates that the smartly designed Janus structure provides the desired comprehensive properties of an oxygenation membrane and offers valuable guidance for the development of more advanced oxygenation membranes.

Abstract: Summary
β-Secretase, the β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), is a key hydrolytic enzyme in the pathway of β-amyloid (Aβ) production in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). BACE1 is considered a promising biomarker for the early detection of AD. A ferrocene probe (Fc-Probe) is synthesized, where the aldehyde group on the probe can specifically recognize the N terminus of the APP peptide fragment. The sensor’s design involves gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface, which allows for the binding of the APP peptide fragment. When BACE1 cleaves the acetylated APP peptide, the N terminus is exposed and triggers an electrochemical signal from the Fc-Probe. The developed sensor can detect BACE1 in a range of 0.02 to 50 U/mL, with a detection limit of 8.0 mU/mL. Such a BACE1 sensor provides a simple, sensitive, and low-cost detection methodology, enabling the “signal-on” detection of BACE1 activity.

Abstract: Summary
Developing sustainable methods for ammonia synthesis is important to combat rising global carbon emissions. An alluring possibility is the electrochemical reduction of nitrogen in an aqueous electrolyte, driven by renewable energy, but a suitable catalyst has remained elusive. Herein, we present the results of a large-scale computational screening study of the catalytic properties of over 800 doped transition metal oxides. Using activity and selectivity descriptors, we identify MoO2-based materials that could possibly catalyze ammonia synthesis, likely along with hydrogen evolution. MoO2 doped with tungsten is the most promising candidate, with predicted limiting potentials ranging from −0.5 to −1.1 V. However, further analysis suggests that hydrogen evolution is likely to be dominant in most cases. By establishing a set of screening criteria, we further provide a framework for future screening studies of doped materials.

Abstract: Summary
Nature builds complex and well-organized biomaterial structures from limited components that exhibit unparalleled mechanical properties. However, reproducing the mechanical properties of their natural counterparts, such as damping properties of insect cuticles, in a simple and universal biological material still remains a grand challenge. Here, we report a binary-solvent-induced self-assembly (BSISA) strategy to induce the self-assembly of chitin, a major component of insect cuticles, into hierarchically structured chitin hydrogels with a more than 100-fold increase in damping properties. These chitin hydrogels are proven to be well-organized hierarchical structures, similar to that observed in insect cuticles. Besides excellent toughness, fatigue resistance, biodegradability, and processability, these chitin hydrogels also exhibit electrifying damping properties (i.e., damping falling ball and protecting high-speed flying objects) over most synthetic soft materials and commercial engineering materials, making them high-performance alternatives to conventional biological materials used in broad application prospects including medical devices, robotics, soft-armor-like protection alternatives, etc.

Abstract: Summary
The efficiency of a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell depends on the mobility of protons in PEMs, which in turn is determined by the hydration and temperature of the membrane. Spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and spin-spin relaxation time (T2) contrast magnetic resonance imaging may be used to map hydration in PEMs under isothermal conditions, but not when there are thermal gradients in PEMs. In this work, we show that a combination of chemical shift and diffusion imaging can decouple and map temperature and hydration in PEMs. We demonstrate a 16 × 16 pixel magnetic resonance imaging mapping of hydration and temperature in Nafion PEMs with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 mm and a total scan time of 3 min, with uncertainty in hydration and temperature of 15% and 6 K, respectively. The method can be generalized for exchange membranes of any flow batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Nanoplastic pollution represents an increasing concern for the scientific community. However, the identification of tiny nano-/microplastics (smaller than 5 μm) is still a huge challenge. Herein, we report rapid detecting and 3D imaging of nano-/microplastics at the single-particle level via a strategy based on stimulated Raman scattering microscopy. We demonstrate detection of nanoplastics as small as 100 nm and discriminate between different types of nanoplastics using high wavenumber scanning with low wavenumber verification. Nano-/microplastics, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, are detected in atmospheric and human lung tissue samples. This work provides a 3D, single-particle-level nano-/microplastics detection method, holding great potential to facilitate the characterization of nano-/microplastics in the environment and human tissues. By demonstrating the real-world utility of our methodology, we hope to foster wider adoption and understanding of this critical tool.

Abstract: Summary
Metal-organic complexes have emerged as surprising n-type materials with high thermoelectric performance, good air stability, and low cost. In this study, we introduce an n-doping modulation strategy to enhance the thermoelectric performance of copper-based metal-organic complexes. Notably, the (Br-C6H3(I)-NH2)2CuBr2 film presents a maximum power factor of 2,631 μW m−1 K−2, achieving one of the highest values for n-type organic thermoelectric materials. Crucially, the room temperature thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT) value is 0.21 and reaches 0.32 at 418 K, positioning it among the highest-performing n-type organic thermoelectric materials. We observe that the high thermoelectric performance of these novel copper-based metal-organic complexes is due to their heavy effective mass and very high band valley degeneracy. This work reveals the significant potential of the n-doping modulation strategy for metal-organic complex semiconductors in developing state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials.

Abstract: Summary
Creating flexible actuators that mimic natural organisms' movements and respond to various stimuli is highly significant for bionic soft robotics, electronics, and wearables. However, achieving a simultaneous response to multiple stimuli within a single actuator still has great challenges in terms of structural design. Here, by combining carbon nanotubes with high photothermal effect, bacterial cellulose with water-triggered expansion, and polyethylene with a large thermal expansion coefficient, a bilayer actuator is proposed with macroscopic and fast response to natural sunlight, low voltage, temperature, humidity, and organic solvents. Based on this, we propose a smart curtain that passively responds to light changes, lowering room temperature by 10.9°C to reduce the huge energy consumption for thermal management of buildings. Besides, a multi-stimulus response curtain that switches according to ambient humidity is designed. Interestingly, this soft actuator can also realize complex bionic motions such as bionic clamping, jumping, self-oscillation, and crawling.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon nanotube (CNT)-reinforced polymer nanocomposites are promising candidates for a myriad of applications. Ad hoc CNT-polymer nanocomposite fabrication techniques inherently pose roadblocks to optimized processing, resulting in microstructural defects, i.e., void formation, poor interfacial adhesion, wettability, and agglomeration of CNTs inside the polymer matrix. Here, we show that a 3D printing technique offers improved processing of CNT-polymer nanocomposites. During printing, the shear-induced flow of an engineered nanocomposite ink through the micronozzle is beneficial, as it reduces the number of voids within the epoxy matrix, improves CNT dispersion and adhesion with epoxy, and partially aligns the CNTs. Such microstructural changes result in enhanced mechanical and thermal properties of the nanocomposites compared to their mold-cast counterparts. This work demonstrates the advantages of 3D printing in achieving improved processing dynamics for the fabrication of CNT-polymer nanocomposites with better structural and functional properties.

Abstract: Summary
In the past two decades, palladium and norbornene (Pd/NBE) co-catalyzed cyclization has become an important method for the synthesis of natural products, drugs, and other materials. Herein, we disclose a Pd/NBE co-catalyzed three-component ipso intermolecular alkyne insertion and cyclization reaction. The reaction pathway first undergoes C-H amination, which results in substituents on both ortho-sites of the aryl palladium intermediate. Its huge steric hindrance poses a challenge for the subsequent alkyne insertion. Mechanistic studies through density functional theory calculations reveal that aryl-norbornyl-palladacycle intermediates do not react with alkynes, and migration insertion is the rate-determining step in the ipso cyclization. In addition, we determine the key role of cesium carbonate in the cyclization process.

Abstract: A fair amount of research on microtubules since their discovery in 1963 has focused on their dynamic tips. In contrast, the microtubule lattice was long believed to be highly regular and static, and consequently received far less attention. Yet, as it turned out, the microtubule lattice is neither as regular, nor as static as previously believed: structural studies uncovered the remarkable wealth of different conformations the lattice can accommodate. In the last decade, the microtubule lattice was shown to be labile and to spontaneously undergo renovation, a phenomenon that is intimately linked to structural defects and was called “microtubule self-repair". Following this breakthrough discovery, further recent research provided a deeper understanding of the lattice self-repair mechanism, which we review here. Instrumental to these discoveries were in vitro microtubule reconstitution assays, in which microtubules are grown from the minimal components required for their dynamics. In this review, we propose a shift from the term “lattice self-repair” to “lattice dynamics”, since this phenomenon is an inherent property of microtubules and can happen without microtubule damage. We focus on how in vitro microtubule reconstitution assays helped us learn (1) which types of structural variations microtubules display, (2) how these structural variations influence lattice dynamics and microtubule damage caused by mechanical stress, (3) how lattice dynamics impact tip dynamics, and (4) how microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) can play a role in structuring the lattice. Finally, we discuss the unanswered questions about lattice dynamics and how technical advances will help us tackle these questions.

Abstract: Summary
Integrating metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) onto textile fibers enables the preparation of MOF-based solid catalysts for practical protective applications such as the degradation of chemical warfare agents (CWAs). While MOF-coated fiber composites show promise for nerve agent hydrolysis under relevant conditions, it is critical to optimize the preparation of these composites to maximize their catalytic activity, permeability, and capture capabilities. Here, we systematically study multiple variables that can affect the catalytic activity and permeability of an MOF-polymer fiber composite based on a zirconium MOF and a non-volatile amine-based crosslinked polyethyleneimine: activation method, MOF mass loading, MOF particle size, and crosslinker amount. We determine that activation methods, MOF mass loadings, and MOF particle size are the most crucial parameters that affect the resulting composite. Ultimately, our work develops composite materials and provides critical insight into the production of MOF-based personal protective equipment for CWA detoxification and reduced CWA permeation under practical conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial-related wound infection places a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. Herein, we report a TEMPO-oxidized bacterial cellulose (TBC)-based hydrogel with a tannic acid (TA)-modified metal-organic framework (TA@ZIF-8 [TZ]), further loaded with MXene (TBC-TA@ZIF-8-MXene [TTZM]), which exhibits great ability to kill bacteria and highly effective bacteria-infected wound healing under 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation. In this work, the synergistic action of antibacterial components Zn2+ and MXene could well inhibit the metabolism of bacteria to realize the efficient and rapid antibacterial. More interestingly, the TTZM hydrogel can promote wound healing by increasing blood vessel regeneration and regulating inflammatory responses. Thus, a TTZM hydrogel with NIR-responsive abilities was directly performed on the bacteria-infected wound model, and we observed accelerated wound repair and regeneration with promoted wound closure and eliminated bacterial infection. This work provides an effective strategy to design a BC-based hydrogel photothermal platform for infectious wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
Solubility is crucial for redox flow batteries because it affects their energy density. A data-driven approach based on artificial intelligence/machine learning models can accelerate the development of highly soluble redox-active materials, but the lack of relevant, large-quantity data makes accurate solubility prediction difficult. To overcome this deficiency, we developed a high-throughput experimentation process that combines a robotically controlled platform with high-throughput methodology to collect large-scale and high-quality solubility data. We demonstrate the potential utility and applicability of this high-throughput process by measuring the aqueous and non-aqueous solubilities of redox-active materials and studying the effect of additives on their solubilities for both aqueous and non-aqueous redox flow battery applications. A redox flow battery based on our optimized negative electrolyte formulation and a ferrocyanide-positive electrolyte offers highly stable performance over 18 days (>100 cycles) with consistent capacity and a 24% boost in energy density.

Abstract: Summary
Battery aging diagnosis using field data readouts presents distinct challenges compared with using laboratory data. These challenges stem from the complexity of the data structure and potential inconsistencies in aging values obtained from variations in battery management system software versions. Consequently, the efficacy of a data-driven approach to identify pertinent aging features from field data becomes susceptible to these factors. In this work, we investigate different feature extraction methods and propose a framework designed to mitigate issues arising from compromised data quality. For this purpose, we leverage the benefits of precise laboratory aging data alongside authentic driving data acquired from a cohort exceeding 600,000 customers to improve the aging diagnosis of vehicle batteries. Moreover, we provide functional fitting of statistical data, addressing the challenges posed by incomplete data structures. We validate our methods by comparing them with state-of-the-art feature extraction techniques, yielding a 57% enhancement in aging estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Summary
Ever-increasing energy consumption of data centers is a growing global concern. To tackle this problem, a high-temperature data center is proposed as a fundamental solution. It adopts a different cooling mechanism and makes “chiller-free” data centers possible, facilitating the transition from chiller-based cooling to completely free cooling in data centers. Here, we report the global energy impacts of adopting high-temperature data centers and critically analyze the trade-off between cooling-energy savings and server power rise using worldwide weather data and server performance data. Quantitative guidance and targets are established for developing “ideal” and “recommendable” servers, considering the server performance associated with the thermal environment. When raising the space temperature to 41°C (namely, the “global free-cooling temperature”), nearly all the land area can achieve 100% free cooling year round globally. Operating at this space temperature, up to 56% cooling-energy savings could be achieved compared with operating at a current typical space temperature of 22°C.

Abstract: Summary
Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have recently garnered widespread attention for their favorable properties, such as stability. However, their application in photoelectric fields is typically limited by the low mobility of charge carriers. Herein, a range of 2D lead-free double perovskites are fabricated using substituted aliphatic diamine cations. This modification leads to distortions in the octahedral structure of 2D perovskites, enhancing the connectivity of atomic orbitals at band edges. Notably (NH3(CH2)3NH3)2AgBiBr8, with minimized layer spacing compared to reported 2D lead-free double perovskites, shows the highest carrier mobility, surpassing its 3D counterpart. (NH3(CH2)3NH3)2AgBiBr8 displays excellent activity and stability in photocatalytic selective oxidation, achieving a toluene conversion up to 100% with a benzoic acid selectivity of 99% under visible light irradiation. Lower hydrophilicity as well as higher toluene adsorption capacity with the diamine cation substitutions could be responsible for the boosted photocatalytic performances.

Abstract: Summary
In recent years, perovskite solar cells have undergone rapid improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE), advancing the development of next-generation photovoltaic technology. However, the presence of interfacial defects, which are prevalent during the film formation process, poses a persistent hurdle to the further improvement of device performance. While defect issues could be alleviated by introducing passivation strategies, the non-uniform dimensions of the top and bottom grain size may still result in unbalanced charge transport. Here, we present a vertical grain-shape engineering (VGE) approach based on anilinium hypophosphite (AHP) to control the vertical growth of perovskite grains. We successfully fabricate a pinhole-free perovskite film with monolithic crystalline structures, demonstrating uniform grain sizes exceeding 2 μm at both the top and bottom surfaces. Champion PCEs of 22.14% and 18.06% are obtained for small-scale (0.08 cm2) and mini-module (aperture area of 14 cm2) blade-coated FAPbI3-based PSCs, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic windows based on reversible metal electrodeposition electronically tint and bleach, enabling user control of light into and out of buildings. The operating mechanism is to reversibly electrodeposit a thin layer of metal (e.g., Cu and Bi) onto a transparent conductor to block light. Tinting to a desired opacity is constrained by a rough film morphology using direct current (DC) electrodeposition, limiting window switching speed. Here, we show that smoother films can be grown with pulsed electrodeposition with a 10% duty cycle and 1-Hz frequency because ions are able to diffuse past protrusions during the rest phase. While these films initially tint slower compared to DC plating, the films using this pulsing protocol reach 0.1% transmittance 45% faster. Finally, we show that pulsing enables consistent optical properties of dynamic windows after 2,400 cycles due to effective suppression of dendrite growth on the metal mesh counter electrode.

Abstract: Summary
The unique properties of quasicrystals are closely related with their complex crystal structures and microstructures. Here, we report the labyrinth structures of decagonal quasicrystal in Al68Cr26Si6, which is scarcely found in quasicrystals. An electron microscopic study of as-cast Al68Cr26Si6 shows a structure of quasiperiodic nanodomains with overall decagonal diffraction symmetry. The quasiperiodic nanodomains are separated by a labyrinthine pattern of edge-connected structural building blocks shaped like squashed (fat) hexagons. The arrangement of the domain walls resembles that of ferroelectric or magnetic domain structures, although these are of different origin and on different scales. By annealing Al68Cr26Si6 at 1,223 K, the domain wall density is strongly increased and appears to be arranged periodically in a specific way.

Abstract: Summary
Steric hindrance groups hold a pivotal role in the self-assembly process of biomolecules. Building on this insight, a strategy for synthesizing outward-everted molecular cages by endo-modification of steric hindrance groups on dissymmetrical ligands is proposed in this work. Specifically, the dissymmetrical ligands have been endo-modified with five distinct bulky hindrance groups, and they are respectively assembled with Pd(II). In order to relieve steric crowding, all hindering groups are oriented outward from the cage, and the arrangement of the two dissymmetrical ligands between adjacent Pd(II) is opposite, indicating high flexibility in regulation. As a result, a low-symmetry hexameric or octameric cage with dissimilar chemical environments for the ligands can be assembled. This work provides valuable insights and has significant implications for the construction of new supramolecular systems.

Abstract: Summary
Since the 1990s, there have been many attempts to efficiently decode molecules; however, for polymers, some descriptions have always been neglected. Details like position and occurrence of molecular structural patterns are hardly possible with such techniques. However, consideration of these details can lead to the ability to predict the properties of polymeric materials in a highly efficient manner. In this study, we have succeeded in taking a further step toward a more concise incorporation of this information. We introduce the polymer fingerprint, a way of representing polymers from common experimental characterization data such as size-exclusion chromatography. In addition, we demonstrate the functionality of the representation for the prediction of cloud-point temperatures. The newly created database for this proof consists of various polymers with different architectures and properties, which were extracted from scientific publications. Finally, we evaluate the limitations and potentialities for such representation-prediction models and their future importance.

Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen, is an urgent health threat causing a wide range of clinical infections. Originally viewed as a strict extracellular pathogen, accumulating evidence has revealed S. aureus to be a facultative intracellular pathogen subverting host cell signalling to support invasion. The majority of clinical isolates produce fibronectin-binding proteins A and B (FnBPA and FnBPB) to interact with host integrin α5β1, a key component of focal adhesions. S. aureus binding of integrin α5β1 promotes its clustering on the host cell surface, triggering activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and cytoskeleton rearrangements to promote bacterial invasion into non-phagocytic cells. Here, we discover that septins, a component of the cytoskeleton that assembles on membranes, are recruited as collar-like structures with actin to S. aureus invasion sites engaging integrin α5β1. To investigate septin recruitment to the plasma membrane in a bacteria-free system, we used FnBPA-coated latex beads and showed that septins are recruited upon activation of integrin α5β1. SEPT2 depletion reduced S. aureus invasion, but increased surface expression of integrin α5 and adhesion of S. aureus to host cells. Consistent with this, SEPT2 depletion increased cellular protein levels of integrin α5 and β1 subunits, as well as FAK. Collectively, these results provide insights into regulation of integrin α5β1 and invasion of S. aureus by the septin cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Summary
Complex rheological properties of the female reproductive tract serve as a long-range guidance mechanism for sperm. However, conventional microscopy methods and population-level studies have restricted our understanding of the combined effects of flow and viscosity on sperm flagellar beating behavior at the single-cell level. Here, using microfluidics, we study individual sperm flagellar dynamics within a physiologically relevant range of viscosity and shear rate. Our results indicate that an increase in shear rate from 0 to 6 s−1 at 75 mPa s reduces the flagellar curvature by 20%, while the peak energy occurs at a shear rate of 3 s−1—a favorable shear rate for sperm rheotaxis. Viscosity has a more dominant influence than shear rate on the flagellar waveform, and the synergistic effect of flow and viscosity promotes energy-efficient beating behavior. Our findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between the environment of the female reproductive tract and sperm function in facilitating fertilization.

Abstract: Summary
Surface ligands are often used to improve perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a series of surface ligands with varying dipole moments are applied at the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)/C60 interface to vary the energy-level alignment. All investigated surface ligands improve PSC performance, with 4-fluorophenethylammonium iodide (FPEAI) displaying the greatest improvement. Transient absorption and reflectance measurements show similar recombination dynamics in all ligand-treated MAPbI3/C60 bilayer films. Transient photovoltage measurements also show similar recombination lifetimes at similar charge-carrier densities; however, differential capacitance measurements indicate that FPEAI shifts the differential capacitance curve to higher voltages. In situ ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that the interfacial energy gap at the MAPbI3/C60 interface increases from 1.19 eV with phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) to 1.50 eV with FPEAI, corresponding to the shift of the differential capacitance curve. This increased interfacial energy gap is responsible for the increased open-circuit voltage (VOC) and should be considered in surface ligand selection.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate band-gap prediction is essential for designing and discovering new materials with desired properties. However, current methods for calculating band gaps based on local and semilocal functionals lead to significant underestimation, hindering the effectiveness of in silico and high-throughput screening of materials. We present a machine learning model with domain adaptation to rapidly yield accurate band-gap prediction of semiconductors (oxides, chalcogenides, nitrides, phosphides, etc.). The approach circumvents the prerequisite for a large amount of physically measured band-gap data, which is notoriously scarce. It instead sources knowledge from a large dataset with underestimated band gaps and subsequently transfers knowledge to train a crystal graph convolution neural network (CGCNN) using a small dataset of accurate, physically measured band gaps. The prediction model shows a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.23 eV, outperforming those using Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functionals (MAE = 0.87 eV). Visualization of the learned crystal graph using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm revealed that the crystal structure and composition have a strong influence on the material band gaps.

Abstract: Summary
The separation of azeotropic mixtures is a key process to achieve the production of high-purity chemicals and the recovery of high value-added products, which is common but difficult in various industrial fields. However, conventional separation strategies suffer from some problems. Here, we report an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly adsorptive separation method to separate toluene and alcohol azeotropes using nonporous adaptive crystals of perethylated pillar[5]arene (EtP5α) and pillar[6]arene (EtP6β). EtP5α or EtP6β separates toluene from a mixture of toluene and alcohol with analytical purity of 100%. Single crystal structures and theoretical calculations reveal that the analytically perfect selectivity originates from the thermodynamic stability of the new host-guest structure of EtP5α or EtP6β upon capturing the preferred guest molecule. The size matching between the toluene molecule and the cavity of pillar[n]arenes is also one of the reasons for the selective separation. Moreover, EtP5α and EtP6β exhibit excellent recyclability and stability.

Abstract: Summary
Electrochemical desalination shows promise for ion-selective, energy-efficient water desalination. This work reviews performance metrics commonly used for electrochemical desalination. We provide a step-by-step guide on acquiring, processing, and calculating raw desalination data, emphasizing informative and reliable figures of merit. A typical experiment uses calibrated conductivity probes to relate measured conductivity to concentration. Using a standard electrochemical desalination cell with activated carbon electrodes, we demonstrate the calculation of desalination capacity, charge efficiency, energy consumption, and ion selectivity metrics. We address potential pitfalls in performance metric calculations, including leakage current (charge) considerations and aging of conductivity probes, which can lead to inaccurate results. The relationships between pH, temperature, and conductivity are explored, highlighting their influence on final concentrations. Finally, we provide a checklist for calculating performance metrics and planning electrochemical desalination tests to ensure accuracy and reliability. Additionally, we offer simplified spreadsheet tools to aid data processing, system design, estimations, and upscaling.

Abstract: Summary
It is highly demanded that organic functional materials that can generate strong and switchable circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CPRTP) be developed. Here, we report a simple and effective strategy to achieve mechanical-tunable CPRTP with high and switchable luminescence dissymmetric factors (glum) by doping a bulky phosphorescent guest, tetra-N-phenylbenzidine (TPB), into reconfigurable cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs). The amount of chain extender plays a vital role in determining the phosphorescent lifetime and mechanical properties in the constructed CLCE composite films. Both the experimental and theoretical results reveal that the bulky TPB compensates for the insufficient rigidity of the CLCEs, resulting in a long-afterglow CPRTP. Moreover, the glum of CPRTP can be tuned from 0.93 to near zero by stretching the CLCEs. Combining the CLCEs’ reconfigurable network and remarkable CPRTP, a 4D encryption luminescent barcode is established, exhibiting great potential for information storage and encryption of these distinct materials.

Abstract: Summary
Non-invasive characterization and monitoring of gas evolution during the operation of commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs) has been a long-term challenge. This paper presents an in situ subsurface ultrasonic array imaging method to detect, locate, and characterize gases generated inside a LIB. Ultrasonic signals scattered from internal gases are collected by a full matrix capture method. A cross-section image showing gases is produced using the velocity-modified total focusing method. The locations and distribution of the gases in both the lateral and thickness directions can be clearly revealed. The finite element simulations and a controlled experiment are performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed array imaging method. Finally, a realistic long-term cycling experiment is performed on a commercial pouch cell. The appearance, evolution, and accumulation of gases are visualized and characterized by analyzing the images produced at different cycles. The experiment findings are validated against the X-ray CT results.

Abstract: Summary
Bioinspired cell-membrane-camouflaged nanohybrids have been proposed to enhance tumor targeting by harnessing their immune escape and self-recognition abilities. In this study, we introduce cancer-cell-derived membrane nanovesicles (CCMVs) integrated with gold nanorods (AuVNRs) in addition to therapeutic and imaging cargos such as doxorubicin and indocyanine green. This approach enhances targeted tumor imaging and enables synergistic chemo-phototherapeutics for solid tumors. CCMVs demonstrate significant tumor penetration and retention, serving as nanotheranostics with accessible surface biomarkers, biomimicking properties, and homologous targeting abilities. By evading uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system, CCMVs can diffuse into the deep tumor core, leading to precise tumor reduction while preserving the surrounding healthy tissues. Notably, intravenous administration of these theranostic agents ensures biocompatibility, as evidenced by a survival period of approximately two months (up to 63 days) without any observed side effects. Our findings underscore the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of this biomimetic nanotheranostics platform.

Abstract: The glycosylation levels of proteins in cancer cells are closely related to cancer invasion and migration. CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is significantly overexpressed in a variety of tumor cells and has been proven to promote the migration and motility of cancer cells, but the effect of its N-glycosylation modification on CD44 protein function in tumors is less studied. Here, we investigated the effect of six N-glycan chains (N25/57/100/110/120/255) on CD44s localization, function and stability in hepatocarcinoma cells. When the six sites were mutated, we found that CD44s lost its membrane localization in Huh7 and MHCC-97H cells. On this basis, we identified three glycosylation sites on CD44s (N57, N100 and N110) that played key roles in intracellular localization. When N57, N100 and N110 were mutated together, CD44 localized to the cytoplasm, while another three-site mutant (N25/N120/N255) was still anchored to the membrane. In addition, the ability of CD44-N57Q/N100Q/N110Q to promote the metastasis and invasion of Huh7 and 97H cells was weakened compared with that of CD44-N25Q/N120Q/N255Q. Furthermore, CD44-N57Q/N100Q/N110Q accumulated abnormally in the ER, and a high level of the ER stress (ERS) marker BiP was detected at the same time compared with wild-type CD44. When the lysosome inhibitor CQ was added, the content of mutant protein that triggered ERS significantly increased, which indicated that the degradation mode of CD44-N57Q/N100Q/N110Q after ERS was mainly through the lysosomal pathway (ERLAD). The results revealed that the N-glycosylation sites N57, N100 and N110 mutated on CD44s affected its function and degraded it by lysosomes after triggering ERS. These findings provide data for new studies on ER-related degradation, further promote the study of the glycan chain function of CD44 and furnish new ideas for the treatment of liver cancer metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Hydrogen produced from electrolysis is an attractive carbon-free fuel and feedstock, but potential benefits depend on the carbon intensity of electricity production. This study uses technoeconomic modeling to analyze the benefits of producing zero-carbon hydrogen through dynamically operated polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers connected to photovoltaic and wind variable renewable energy (VRE) sources. Dynamic operation is considered for current densities between 0 and 6 A cm−2 and compared to a constant current density of 2 A cm−2 for different combinations of VRE to electrolysis (VRE:E) capacity ratios and compositions of photovoltaic and wind energy in four locations across the United States. For optimal VRE:E and wind:photovoltaic capacity ratios, dynamic operation is found to reduce the levelized cost of hydrogen by 5%–9%, while increasing hydrogen production by 134%–173%, and decreasing excess electrical power by 82%–95%. The framework herein may be used to determine the optimal VRE:E capacity and VRE mix for dynamically operated green hydrogen systems.

Abstract: Summary
Improvements in yellow light production, a healthy light source for the eyes that is also beneficial to biological growth, are needed to satisfy the practical requirements of solid-state lighting. Here, we report high-brightness yellow light emission in zero-dimensional lead-free double-perovskite Rb2TeCl6 microcrystals (MCs) driven by high-pressure processing. We note that the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) experience a significant enhancement by an order of magnitude upon a mild pressure of 1.7 GPa. The overlap between ground state and self-trapped state is reduced by pressure-tailored electron-phonon coupling. Accordingly, the phonon-assisted non-radiative relaxation is inhibited, resulting in a considerable increase in PLQY. Furthermore, marked piezochromism from pale yellow to green is realized in compressed Rb2TeCl6 MCs. Our study not only enables pressure as a robust tool to boost yellow light efficiency but also provides deep insights into the underlying photophysical mechanism, facilitating the rational synthesis of materials by design.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon dioxide utilization via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a potentially scalable method to mitigate rising global carbon dioxide emissions if high carbon monoxide yields and reaction rates can be achieved at low reaction temperatures. Iron oxide (Fe2O3) has been extensively studied as a chemical looping material in RWGS, but nearly all studies were performed at high temperatures, where sintering and deactivation occur. Here, we investigate Fe2O3 as an RWGS chemical looping metal oxide at low reaction temperatures (500°C for both oxidation and reduction steps) and find that a direct, reversible, and stable metal/oxide phase transition results in a high carbon monoxide yield of 386 mL CO/g-Fe2O3/cycle. The measured carbon monoxide yield remains relatively stable for 350 redox cycles or 12.1 days on stream. The affordability and abundance of Fe2O3, the high carbon monoxide yield, and its extended time-on-stream without substantial performance degredation makes Fe2O3 a RWGS chemical looping metal oxide with a promising chance of commercialization.

Abstract: Summary
Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) can target and stimulate recombination reactions in genomic DNA. We have reported that γPNA oligomers possessing the diethylene glycol γ-substituent show improved efficacy over unmodified PNAs in stimulating recombination-induced gene modification. However, this structural modification poses a challenge because of the inherent racemization risk in O-alkylation of the precursory serine side chain. To circumvent this risk and improve γPNA accessibility, we explore the utility of γPNA oligomers possessing the hydroxymethyl-γ moiety for gene-editing applications. We demonstrate that a γPNA oligomer possessing the hydroxymethyl modification, despite weaker preorganization, retains the ability to form a hybrid with the double-stranded DNA target of comparable stability and with higher affinity than that of the diethylene glycol-γPNA. When formulated into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles, the hydroxymethyl-γPNA stimulates higher frequencies (≥1.5-fold) of gene modification than the diethylene glycol γPNA in mouse bone marrow cells.

Abstract: Summary
Leveraging the power of organometallic chemistry for inventing diverse functionalization of dienes is of great significance in synthetic chemistry. The coupling of dienes with α,β-unsaturated ketones generally affords dehydroallylated products under low-valent metal catalysis. Therefore, it is highly appealing to exploit an efficient catalytic system to achieve a distinct chemoselectivity, especially with switchable regioselectivity. Through tuning the oxidative cyclometallation step, we herein report a nickel(0)-catalyzed regiodivergent hydrobivinylation of enones with dienes. Aryldienes participate in the transformation efficiently, providing 1,4-disubstituted dienes in good regio- and stereoselectivity. By contrast, the addition site switches to the C1 position in the case of alkyldienes. The key to this strategy’s success depends on the preferential formation of oxa-nickelacycle. Besides, the resulting diene products could undergo an array of elaborate transformations, which highlights the potential of this protocol.

Abstract: Summary
Gamma peptide nucleic acids (γPNAs) have recently garnered attention in diverse therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Serine and diethylene-glycol-containing γPNAs have been tested for numerous RNA-targeting purposes. Here, we comprehensively evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of pH-low insertion peptide (pHLIP)-conjugated serine and diethylene-based γPNAs. pHLIP targets only the acidic tumor microenvironment and not the normal cells. We synthesized and parallelly tested pHLIP-serine γPNAs and pHLIP-diethylene glycol γPNAs that target the seed region of microRNA-155, a microRNA that is upregulated in various cancers. We performed an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation-based computational study to elucidate the interaction of pHLIP-γPNA constructs with the lipid bilayer. We also determined the biodistribution and efficacy of the pHLIP constructs in the U2932-derived xenograft model. Overall, we established that the pHLIP-serine γPNAs show superior results in vivo compared with the pHLIP-diethylene glycol-based γPNA.

Abstract: Summary
The post-translational modifications of histone H4 play significant roles in regulation of epigenetic status. Reconstituted nucleosomes that mimic the native chromatin are valuable for histone modification research, which requires site-specifically modified histone. Sortase-mediated ligation (SML) has advantages of easy preparation of substrates and robust kinetics, and recent nucleosome-based deacylation research of histone H3 and H2B has benefitted from SML. Here we report a novel semisynthesis method of histone H4 via SML, which allowed us to prepare nucleosomes containing multivalently modified histone H4 for investigations of histone deacetylation by sirtuins. In addition, we identified a subfamily of PWWP domain-containing proteins as novel H4K20me3 readers by photo-crosslinking from multifunctional nucleosome probes. The studies revealed new mechanisms that might not be available using histone peptides. As a result, the new method is expected to accelerate our understanding of histone H4 modifications, and the identified new readers will expand our understanding of H4K20 methylation.

Abstract: Background
Blood component transfusions are a common and often necessary medical practice during the epidemics of dengue. Transfusions are required for patients when they developed severe dengue fever or thrombocytopenia of 10×109/L or less. This study therefore investigated the risk factors, performance and effectiveness of eight different machine-learning algorithms to predict blood component transfusion requirements in confirmed dengue cases admitted to hospital. The objective was to study the risk factors that can help to predict blood component transfusion needs.
Methods
Eight predictive models were developed based on retrospective data from a private group of hospitals in India. A python package SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to explain the output of the “XGBoost” model.
Results
Sixteen vital variables were finally selected as having the most significant effects on blood component transfusion prediction. The XGBoost model presented significantly better predictive performance (area under the curve: 0.793; 95 % confidence interval: 0.699–0.795) than the other models.
Conclusion
Predictive modelling techniques can be utilized to streamline blood component preparation procedures and can help in the triage of high-risk patients and readiness of caregivers to provide blood component transfusions when required. This study demonstrates the potential of multilayer algorithms to reasonably predict any blood component transfusion needs which may help healthcare providers make more informed decisions regarding patient care.

Abstract: This review provides an overview of the current methods for quantifying mitochondrial ultrastructure, including cristae morphology, mitochondrial contact sites, and recycling machinery and a guide to utilizing electron microscopy to effectively measure these organelles. Quantitative analysis of mitochondrial ultrastructure is essential for understanding mitochondrial biology and developing therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial-related diseases. Techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and serial block face-scanning electron microscopy, as well as how they can be combined with other techniques including confocal microscopy, super-resolution microscopy, and correlative light and electron microscopy are discussed. Beyond their limitations and challenges, we also offer specific magnifications that may be best suited for TEM analysis of mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, and recycling machinery. Finally, perspectives on future quantification methods are offered.

Abstract: Summary
The enhancement of individual marking performance of taggants remains a challenge for special character tracking even after decades of development. Here, a method based on the polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) functionalization of upconversion nanoplates (UCNPs) to improve the interaction between the taggant and skin is reported. It is shown that the molecular weight of the PVP used to decorate the surface of stacked Fe3+-doped NaBiF4:Yb/Er UCNPs (Fe-UCNPs) plays a critical role in enhancing taggant marking performance. This can be attributed to the strong noncovalent interactions between the functionalized UCNPs and skin which facilitated surface adhesion as well as the effective chemical penetration concentrated in the limited depth of the stratum corneum due to the long polymer chain and the μm-size-induced blocking of the UCNPs. We believe that these results may shine light on the exploration of individual marking taggants and may help promote the practical application of fluorescent taggants for special character tracking.

Abstract: Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 8 (MFSD8) is a transmembrane protein that has been reported to function as a lysosomal chloride channel. In humans, homozygous mutations in MFSD8 cause a late-infantile form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) called CLN7 disease. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, Mfsd8 localizes to cytoplasmic puncta and vesicles, and regulates conserved processes during the organism’s life cycle. Here, we used D. discoideum to examine the effect of mfsd8-deficiency on the secretome during the early stages of multicellular development. Mass spectrometry revealed 61 proteins that were differentially released by cells after 4 and 8 h of starvation. Most proteins were present in increased amounts in mfsd8- conditioned buffer compared to WT indicating that loss of mfsd8 deregulates protein secretion and/or causes the release of proteins not normally secreted by WT cells. GO term enrichment analyses showed that many of the proteins aberrantly released by mfsd8- cells localize to compartments and regions of the cell associated with the endo-lysosomal and secretory pathways. Mass spectrometry also revealed proteins previously known to be impacted by the loss of mfsd8 (e.g., cathepsin D), as well as proteins that may underlie mfsd8-deficiency phenotypes during aggregation. Finally, we show that mfsd8-deficiency reduces intracellular proteasome 20S activity due to the abnormal release of at least one proteasomal subunit. Together, this study reveals the impact of mfsd8 loss on the secretome during D. discoideum aggregation and lays the foundation for follow up work that investigates the role of altered protein release in CLN7 disease.

Abstract: Summary
Measurements of kinase activity are important for kinase-directed drug development, analysis of inhibitor structure and function, and understanding mechanisms of drug resistance. Sensitive, accurate, and miniaturized assay methods are crucial for these investigations. Here, we describe a label-free, high-throughput mass spectrometry-based assay for studying individual kinase enzymology and drug discovery in a purified system, with a focus on validated drug targets as benchmarks. We demonstrate that this approach can be adapted to many known kinase substrates and highlight the benefits of using mass spectrometry to measure kinase activity in vitro, including increased sensitivity. We speculate that this approach to measuring kinase activity will be generally applicable across most of the kinome, enabling research on understudied kinases and kinase drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
In aqueous electrolytes, the stability of the zinc anode is threatened by severe dendrite growth and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, diethylene glycol (DEG) is used as an anti-solvent agent to address the abovementioned issues and boost the reversibility of the zinc anode. The DEG has a strong affinity to the Zn anode, thereby steering dominant (002)-textured zinc growth without dendrites. Multiple spectroscopic techniques, theoretical calculations, and molecular dynamics simulation have demonstrated that DEG can reconstruct the solvation sheath of Zn2+ and reduce the amount of active H2O to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction. This anti-solvent strategy enables the stable cycle life of Zn-Zn cells over 4,200 h, and the Zn-Cu cells deliver a high average coulombic efficiency >99.75% for 1,100 cycles (>2,000 h). Accordingly, zinc-activated carbon full batteries operated steadily for 19,000 cycles (>3 months). This work provides a new anti-solvent strategy for achieving high-stability zinc anodes by inducing (002)-texture growth through electrolyte modification.

Abstract: Summary
Hydrogels have high water content, excellent biocompatibility, and tissue-matched compliance, which are favorable for interfacing with biological tissues, and they have attracted wide attention in soft electronics. However, current difficulties, such as interconnection issues with the metallic interface, and deficient fabrication strategies still pose great challenges. Here, a facile in situ 3D printing method is developed to fabricate liquid metal (LM)-hydrogel hybrids, which enable mechanical compliance to soft tissues (∼10 kPa), thus serving as the bio-interface of hydrogel bioelectronics or devices. Moreover, LM-hydrogel hybrids have good electrical interconnection with conventional electrical interfaces due to the excellent wetting and alloyed behavior of LM and commonly used metallic conductors. The LM-hydrogel hybrid can also be directly used for electronic components or devices without any further encapsulation or assembly process. Such LM-hydrogel hybrid via this convenient and almost automatic in situ 3D printing method may set up a multifunctional platform for hydrogel bioelectronics and devices.

Abstract: Summary
Graphene’s physical and chemical properties have garnered significant attention for its use in detecting hazardous gases through electrical detection methods such as conductance or resistance measurements. Despite the development of multi-functionalized sensor arrays, the challenge of limited selectivity in detecting multiple gases persists. To address this issue, we employ a lock-in technique to measure both conductance and dielectric modulations in graphene chips, resulting in valuable enhanced selectivity and uncompromised sensing response compared with conventional charge detection methods based on mere conductance measurements. We also demonstrate the practicality of our dual-parameter sensing scheme through selective detection of multiple gases at (sub) ppm concentrations using metal oxide functionalized graphene sensor arrays, serving as a proof of concept for its broader application in gas sensing.

Abstract: Summary
Multicomponent self-assembly offers a strategy to explore ordered, complex, and dynamic nanosystems and to harness the property of the whole system beyond that of each subcomponent. However, the spontaneous nature of co-self-assembly makes control of the process difficult. Here, we use a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction as an in situ dynamic covalent reaction to slowly produce disulfide macrocycles that subsequently trigger the co-self-assembly with an anticancer drug and a photosensitizer. The gradual concentration growth of products shows kinetic control over the concentration of self-assembling disulfides, resulting in a stable co-delivery nanosystem with high drug-loading efficiency (31.78%) and encapsulation efficiency (95.91%). The nanosystem possesses biocompatibility, tumor-accumulating ability, and biosafety and shows a synergistic chemotherapeutic and photodynamic anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that in situ dynamic covalent chemistry advances control over co-self-assembly, paving the way to more functional nanosystems with potential applications in biomedicine, electronics, and renewable energy.

Abstract: We investigated the predictive capacity of six prognostic indices [Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), Hematopoietic Cell Transplant-Specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI), Disease Risk Index (DRI), European Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and Revised Pre-Transplantation Assessment of Mortality (rPAM) Scores and Endothelial Activation and Stress Index (EASIX)] in 205 adults undergoing post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based allo-HCT. KPS, HCT-CI, DRI and EASIX grouped patients into higher and lower risk strata. KPS and EASIX maintained appropriate discrimination for OS prediction across the first 2 years after allo-HCT [receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve (AUC) > 55 %)]. The discriminative capacity of DRI and HCT-CI increased during the post-transplant period, with a peak of prediction at 2 years (AUC of 61.1 % and 61.8 %). The maximum rPAM discriminative capacity was at 1 year (1-year AUC of 58.2 %). The predictive capacity of the EBMT score was not demonstrated. This study validates the discrimination capacity for OS prediction of KPS, HCT-CI, DRI and EASIX in PTCy-based allo-HCT.

Abstract: Summary
Chemoproteomics is a powerful method capable of detecting interactions between small molecules and the proteome; however, its use as a high-throughput screening method for chemical libraries has so far been limited. To address this need, we have further developed a chemoproteomics workflow to screen cysteine-reactive covalent fragments in cell lysates against the deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes using activity-based protein profiling. By using targeted ubiquitin probes, we have addressed sensitivity and affinity limitations, enabling target identification and covalent fragment library profiling in a 96-well plate format. The use of data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis combined with automated Evosep liquid chromatography (LC) reduced instrument runtimes to 21 min per sample and simplified the workflow. In this proof-of-concept study, we profile 138 covalent fragments against 57 DUB proteins and validate four hit fragments against OTUD7B and UCHL3 through site identification experiments and orthogonal biochemical activity assays.

Abstract: Summary
Daytime radiative cooling materials can help prevent overheating by keeping exterior roof surfaces cool, but can they passively reject heat from inside buildings, overcoming thermal gains from healthy air changes without mechanical assistance? Here we report how to produce sub-ambient interior temperatures by balancing terrestrial radiative cooling with temperature-driven ventilation and thermal mass. We present a field study with model enclosures replicating one occupant’s heat balance and air changes. The reference box represents a "gold standard" in passive cooling, with thermal mass and night ventilation offsetting internal heat gains. The test box maintains an interior temperature of 3.9°C below the mean prevailing exterior temperature and 8.9°C below the gold standard, despite being actively heated from within and venting seven air changes per hour during the day. We also show with a calibrated model how to improve the cooling and ventilation performance while scaling the results to actual buildings.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon efficiency is one of the most pressing problems of carbon dioxide electroreduction today. While there have been studies on anion exchange membrane electrolyzers with carbon dioxide (gas) and bipolar membrane electrolyzers with bicarbonate (aqueous) feedstocks, both suffer from low carbon efficiency. In anion exchange membrane electrolyzers, this is due to carbonate anion crossover, whereas in bipolar membrane electrolyzers, the exsolution of carbon dioxide (gas) from the bicarbonate solution is the culprit. Here, we first elucidate the root cause of the low carbon efficiency of liquid bicarbonate electrolyzers with thermodynamic calculations and then achieve carbon-efficient carbon dioxide electroreduction by adopting a near-neutral-pH cation exchange membrane, a glass fiber intermediate layer, and carbon dioxide (gas) partial pressure management. We convert highly concentrated bicarbonate solution to solid formate fuel with a yield (carbon efficiency) of greater than 96%. A device test is demonstrated at 100 mA cm−2 with a full-cell voltage of 3.1 V for over 200 h.

Abstract: Summary
Stable, high-quality, repeatable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are crucial for commercialization, necessitating a technique providing spatially and spectrally resolved material insights for defect identification. Such a tool supports the creation of reliable processes essential for both research and development and industry. We report a multifunctional imaging approach to extract spatially and spectrally resolved information of various key optoelectronic parameters of PSCs and their correlations. The spatially resolved optical parameters include optical band gap, spectrally resolved absorptivity and luminescence, and Urbach energy of PSCs. The optical band-gap image and the spectrally resolved absorptivity of PSCs are obtained from the hyperspectral cube of luminescence measured by a hyperspectral imaging tool. Meanwhile, the spatially resolved electrical parameters including implied open-circuit voltage, ideality factor, and activation energy of recombination can be obtained by employing an illumination-intensity-dependent and temperature-dependent photoluminescence method. Based on these images, correlations between key optoelectronic parameters can be examined for different regions across the PSCs, before and after degradation tests.

Abstract: Objective
The aim of this study was to determine the association between dental tissues and sickle cell anemia (SCA) and how it impacts the quality of life related to oral health.
Materials and Methods
It was a cohort study of 154 Congolese participants with and without SCA conducted in the dental service of SCA at the Yolo Center, Kinshasa, aged at least 6 years and without a history of clinically severe conditions (hospitalization and blood transfusion), who were regularly monitored. The inclusion criteria were the diagnosis confirmation of SCA at the health service in a period of at least 6 months before enrollment in this study. Dental tissues were assessed by a clinical examination using a dental mirror and probe. The index of Decayed-Missing-Filled Teeth (DMFT) was used to assess the dental state of the participants. For Oral Health-related Quality of Life (OHrQoL), the Congolese versions of the perception questionnaires, modified from the Oral Health Impacts Profile (OHIP-23), were used for participants. Each question had to be answered by yes or no, depending on whether the participant was satisfied (outcome = 1) or dissatisfied (outcome = 0) about an oral health-related quality of life.
Results
Of the 154 participants, aged from 6 to 64 years, with a mean age of 19.5 ± 7 (SD) years, 96 presented with SCA and only 68 were correctly followed; 102 did not present SCA and only 86 were correctly followed. The DMFT and dmft indexes were higher in the SCA group, being 2.9 and 2.5, respectively. The difference between the SCA group and the control group was significant for decayed teeth, missing teeth, filled teeth and no caries. Of the different dimensions of quality of life that were compared between the SCA group and control group, 15 of 23 items were statistically significant.
Conclusion
The present study strongly confirmed an association between dental caries and missing teeth with sickle cell anemia. Secondly, the quality of life for SCA participants seems to be poor, compared to the control group.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LD) are functionally conserved fat storage organelles found in all cell types. LDs have a unique structure comprising of a hydrophobic core of neutral lipids (fat), triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesterol esters (CE) surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer. LD surface is decorated by a multitude of proteins and enzymes rendering this compartment functional. Accumulating evidence suggests that LDs originate from discrete ER-subdomains, demarcated by the lipodystrophy protein seipin, however, the mechanisms of which are not well understood. LD biogenesis factors together with biophysical properties of the ER membrane orchestrate spatiotemporal regulation of LD nucleation and growth at specific ER subdomains in response to metabolic cues. Defects in LD formation manifests in several human pathologies, including obesity, lipodystrophy, ectopic fat accumulation, and insulin resistance. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the molecular events during initial stages of eukaryotic LD assembly and discuss the critical role of factors that ensure fidelity of this process.

Abstract: Summary
Protein language models have been gaining attention and have achieved some exciting breakthroughs in protein modeling tasks compared with the utilization of co-evolutionary and biological priors. To overcome the shortcomings of existing large-scale protein language models, such as high computational complexity and large memory consumption, we propose a lightweight protein language model, ProtFlash. It is the first protein language model with linear complexity based on an attention strategy, which differs significantly from existing methods in that it primarily utilizes multiple positional encodings and a mixed chunk attention mechanism that combines local and global attention. Furthermore, the results of the Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings show that ProtFlash achieves a better or equivalent performance than the state-of-the-art protein language models. As shown through a rigorous comparison of computational complexity and memory consumption, it also performs better than existing protein language models.

Abstract: Summary
Two-dimensional melting has been attracting extensive interest because of its promise for understanding fundamental physics and fabrication of functional materials. However, a full understanding of two-dimensional melting is still lacking. Here, by executing simulations for hard truncated rhombs, we reveal five melting scenarios that provide an expanded picture of two-dimensional melting. Among these five scenarios, two had not yet been observed, including a first-order solid-to-mesophase transition followed by either a continuous or first-order mesophase-to-isotropic-fluid transition. These scenarios emerge at the transition regions between one-step and two-step melting regimes. Further investigation demonstrates that the melting scenario is shape tunable, which depends on the anisotropic nature and the competition between the orientational and positional entropy of particles. Notably, both the disclosed scenarios and associated mechanism are out of the coverage of current models, including Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-Helperin-Nelson-Young theory, which sheds light on melting physics and phase behavior in two dimensions.

Abstract: Summary
Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer a highly promising solution for achieving low-cost, high-performance photovoltaics. However, to accelerate the development of the PSC technology, it is critical to quantify local performance losses and identify problematic regions across the device. Obtaining spatially resolved information is essential not only for device fabrication but also for material optimization, particularly when scaling up the perovskite technology. In this work, we propose an imaging-based approach to spatially resolve local series resistance, power conversion efficiency (PCE), and charge-transfer efficiency across PSCs by employing bias-dependent photoluminescence (PL). By analyzing these parameters' images, we find a significant correlation between the charge-transfer efficiency and the PCE. However, we observe a weak correlation between the intensity of the PL image taken under open-circuit conditions and the final PCE of the device. This finding highlights the risk of misinterpreting the device performance if using only PL intensities. Moreover, we demonstrate the impact of the voltage-dependent series resistance on the accuracy of the device simulation. This work presents another important contribution of luminescence imaging to the research and development of the perovskite solar cells technology.

Abstract: Summary
Due to the significant differences in the physical and chemical properties of polymers and metals, their additive manufacturing is conducted using very different and incompatible methods or conditions. Such incompatibility is a significant limitation for multimaterial 3D printing and fabrication of 3D functional composites. We address this issue by creating functional composites composed of thermoplastic elastomers, Field’s metal, and graphene; and their 3D printability by fused filament fabrication is achieved. The fully recyclable 3D-printable composites are featured with widely tunable internal structures and mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Multiphysics modeling is further developed to elucidate the structure-property relationship. The 3D structures can be transformed from insulative to conductive based on the melting and coalescence of Field’s metal nanoparticles. The incorporation of graphene bridges the adjacent Field’s metal particles and significantly enhances conductivity. Such 3D-printable polymer-metal hybrid platform could enable advancements in soft electronics and robotics and in energy storage.

Abstract: Summary
Heat spreading is critical in reducing the overall junction temperature of monolithic system-on-chips (SoCs) and high-heat-flux radio frequency (RF) applications. Bulk diamond has the highest thermal conductivity (TC) in nature, but its TC degrades due to the presence of smaller and highly columnar grains. Diamond thin films can be used as the back-end-of-line (BEOL) dielectrics and thermal vias for effective heat spreading if high-quality isotropic diamond growth processes are developed. In this study, we grow large-grain thin-film diamonds (0.3–25 μm) with isotropic TC (300–1,800 W/m/K). This is achieved by controlling the lateral growth and terminating smaller grains at the nucleation stage without physically damaging the substrate. The enhancement of TC is achieved by lowering grain boundary density and graphite at the grains. Thermal modeling indicates that incorporating isotropic thin diamond reduces the temperature in a realistic flip chip and a monolithic 3D deep neural net accelerator by 20% and 50%, respectively.

Abstract: Introduction
Infections represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). In Latin America, data on infectious complications in newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients are limited.
Methods
We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort study of patients with NDMM in Uruguay between June 2019 and December 2020. Patients with active disease, on active therapy and who provided written informed consent were included. Elegible patients were followed for 6 months from the time of diagnosis and before proceeding to autologous stem cell transplantation or until death, whichever occurred first. Our primary endpoint was the number of infectious events that required hospitalization for ≥ 24 h.
Main results
Of 124 patients with NDMM, 54 (43.5 %) had infectious complications (74 infectious events), the majority (74.3 %) within the first 3 months from diagnosis. The most common sites of infection were urinary (39.2 %) and respiratory tracts (33.8 %). The microbial agent was identified in 60.8 % of patients with Gram-negative bacteria (71.4 %) as the most common pathogen. Viral and fungal infections were infrequent. In the multivariable analysis, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was ≥ 2 (odds ratio [OR], 2.16; 95 % confidence interval [95 %CI], 1.23 - 3.79; p = 0.008) and creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dl (OR, 2.33; 95 %CI, 1.33 - 4.07; p = 0.003) were independent factors associated with bacterial infections. At 6 months, 14 patients (11.3 %) had died, 50 % related to infectious complications.
Conclusion
Bacterial infections are a substantial cause of hospital admissions and early death in patients with NDMM. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered to reduce infectious complications in patients with MM.

Abstract: Summary
Rational design of photocatalysts is critical for efficient solar-light-driven carbon dioxide reduction. The conjugation of metal-organic framework (MOF) and covalent organic framework (COF) is a promising strategy but limited by the disparate interfacial energy and nucleation kinetics between heteroid MOF and COF. Herein, a lattice-matched MOF@COF core-shell catalyst, i.e., UiO-MOF@TpPa-COF, is developed via an in situ epitaxial growth strategy. The coherent interface of (111)UiO-66-NH2//(001)TpPa-COF meets both kinetic and thermodynamic driving force requirements. Moreover, the free rotation of linkers exhibits dynamic self-adaptive behavior to lower the lattice misfit. In solar-light-driven carbon dioxide reduction, the UiO-MOF@TpPa-COF could induce the electron migration from TpPa-COF to UiO-66-NH2 by directional charge transfer channels. As a result, the UiO-MOF@TpPa-COF achieves nearly 100% selectivity for the carbon dioxide photoreduction to formic acid, with a high rate of ∼178.3 μmol g−1·h−1. This contribution demonstrates that the design of lattice-matched MOF@COF catalysts could be a paradigm for carbon dioxide photoconversion.

Abstract: Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia is a challenging disease, due to a poor prognosis in developing countries. Herein, we aim to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes after chemotherapy and transplantation.
Methods
A retrospective analytic observational study was performed with patients under 18 years of age with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia treated at a referral center in Colombia. Two groups were compared: induction therapy (IT) and induction therapy plus consolidation (IT + C). The survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–Meier method.
Results
We analyzed 34 patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia; 20 received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Most were French-American-British (FAB) classification types M1, M5 and M0. The transplantation was haploidentical in 65%, conditioning was myeloablative in 67% and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis was performed with post-transplant cyclophosphamide in 70%. Overall, the 5-year survival was 52% and the overall 5-year survival in the transplanted group was 80%. There were 16 deaths; in the IT group, n = 12, and in the IT + C group, n = 4. In the former, the main cause of death was septic shock and in the latter, it was relapse.
Conclusion
Transplantation is a safe option. Receiving treatment and supportive measures in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation units is necessary to avoid infections, especially during induction cycles.

Abstract: Summary
Optogenetics promises to manipulate the brain circuitry by exciting or inhibiting the same neurons via different colors of light (i.e., bidirectionality), and furthermore, to co-work with electrophysiology for low-crosstalk, high-resolution probing of the brain. Limited by feasible integration methods, though, neural probes with close-packed dual-color light sources remain underdeveloped, making high-resolution bidirectional in vivo optogenetic electrophysiology technically challenging. Here, we report, based on heterogeneously stacked III–V epitaxial films, a monolithic neural probe integrated with close-packed dual-color micro-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and microelectrodes in 20- and 50-μm pitches, respectively. The resulting devices enable bidirectional in vivo optogenetic electrophysiology across layers IV and V of mouse somatosensory cortex, where dual-color LEDs are observed to excite and inhibit layer-specific brain dynamics. Such interlayer bidirectional in vivo optogenetic studies, to which our scalable probes are well suited, can add to high-resolution interrogation of the brain circuitry and shed light on animal disease models.

Abstract: Summary
Misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (αS) into toxic conformations is involved in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson’s disease (PD), this occurs within dopaminergic neurons, causing cell death and disease symptoms. During αS aggregation, many protein-protein interactions (PPIs) form over broad and flat protein surfaces, limiting potential for small-molecule intervention. Peptides, however, harbor great therapeutic promise since they can selectively engage with and modulate the large surface areas involved yet are small enough to function as druggable agents if suitably structured. Here, we explore the first 25 residues of αS (αS1–25) as a template for peptide-based αS aggregation antagonists. We report that αS1–25 inhibits lipid-induced αS aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. αS1–25 functions by binding to lipids to prevent αS binding, with both αS and peptide requiring lipid for inhibition to occur. These findings present a potential mechanistic route for the treatment or prevention of PD.

Abstract: Summary
Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has attracted significant attention as a photoanode material in photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices. However, its photoelectrochemical performance is limited by rapid photogenerated charge recombination and photocorrosion. Herein, we report a simple post-synthetic treatment for BiVO4 that overcomes its surface and bulk limitations and deposits a thin polyaniline layer to improve photostability. To further improve the water oxidation kinetics, a nickel- and iron-containing cocatalyst is deposited on the outermost layer of the photoanode. Comprehensive electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and surface photovoltage characterizations reveal that the polyaniline layer effectively preserves the surface composition of photocharged BiVO4 and prevents its photocorrosion, whereas the cocatalyst offers an additional driving force for water oxidation. The photocharged BiVO4/polyaniline/cocatalyst photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 5.2 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) with long-term photostability over 18 h. This work provides a simple strategy for improving the photoelectrochemical stability of photocharged BiVO4 photoanodes.

Abstract: Summary
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have editable structures and customizable functions. However, when most MOFs are exposed to water or humid air, their structures are degraded, which decreases the efficiency of water-based applications. Herein, we provide a ligand “lock and fix” post-synthetic modification strategy to create stable MOF in aqueous and photo-irradiation environments. We designed a cerium-based MOF (Ce-bpy) composed of cerium-oxo clusters and 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylate (bpy). In parallel, we constructed a stable MOF by functionalizing Ce-bpy with copper ions and 2,2′-bipyridyl. Calculations suggest that the modified MOF limits the inner rotational freedom of the ligands, increasing the rigidness and thus the aqueous stability. Furthermore, the stable MOF is used for both the photodegradation of tetracycline and phosphate detection. These findings show that the strategy could effectively enhance the resistance of MOFs to aqueous environments, allowing for water-based applications.

Abstract: Summary
Architected materials possessing physico-chemical properties adaptable to disparate environmental conditions embody a disruptive new domain of materials science. Fueled by advances in digital design and fabrication, materials shaped into lattice topologies enable a degree of property customization not afforded to bulk materials. A promising venue for inspiration toward their design is in the irregular micro-architectures of nature. However, the immense design variability unlocked by such irregularity is challenging to probe analytically. Here, we propose a new computational approach using graph-based representation for regular and irregular lattice materials. Our method uses differentiable message passing algorithms to calculate mechanical properties, allowing automatic differentiation with surrogate derivatives to adjust geometric structure and local attributes of individual lattice elements to achieve inversely designed materials with desired properties. We further introduce a graph neural network surrogate model for structural analysis at scale. The methodology is generalizable to any system representable as heterogeneous graphs.

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients with AML treated between 2008 and 2020 who obtained complete remission (CR) after one cycle of induction chemotherapy and received consolidation with at least one cycle of high-dose cytarabine (defined as 3 g/m2 every 12 h days 1, 3 and 5).
Results
Among 61 patients who received induction remission, 32 obtained CR and 28 received at least one cycle of high-dose cytarabine, for a total of 67 cycles (median 2 cycles per patient, range 1 – 4). In 45 cycles (67.2%) the patient was discharged after the end of chemotherapy, with a median of 6 days at home (range 3 – 8). Readmission occurred in 31 of the 45 cycles (68.9%). The most frequent toxicities were febrile neutropenia (56.7%), nausea and vomiting (23.9%), oral mucositis (14.9%) and diarrhea (11.9%). Bacteremia was documented in 13 cycles (34.2%). There were three cases of typhlitis and two of invasive fungal disease (aspergillosis and candidemia). Four patients died (14.3%), with two deaths considered treatment-related (candidemia and typhlitis).
Conclusion
In the setting of a Brazilian public hospital, high-dose cytarabine as consolidation therapy is feasible, with manageable toxicity profile.

Abstract: Microtubules are essential cytoskeletal polymers, which exhibit stochastic transitions between assembly and disassembly, known as catastrophes and rescues. Understanding of catastrophes, rescues, and their control by drugs and microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) has been informed by in vitro reconstitutions of microtubule dynamics. In such experiments microtubules are typically observed on a flat surface of the coverslip. In contrast, we have recently proposed a modified setup in which microtubules assemble from stabilized seeds, overhanging from microfabricated pedestals, so that their dynamic extensions are fully isolated from contact with the coverslip. This assay allows to eliminate potential artifacts, which may substantially affect the frequency of microtubule rescues in vitro. Here we use the pedestal assay to study the sensitivity of microtubules to paclitaxel, one of the best-known inhibitors of microtubule dynamics. By comparing observations in the conventional and the pedestal assays, we find that microtubule dynamics are substantially more sensitive to paclitaxel when the polymers can contact the coverslip. We interpret this as a consequence of the coverslip-induced microtubule assembly perturbation, leading to formation of lattice with defects, and thereby enhancing the efficiency of paclitaxel binding to microtubules in the conventional assay. To test this idea, we use vinblastine, another small-molecule inhibitor, which had been previously shown to cause microtubule growth perturbations. We find that in the pedestal assay vinblastine sensitizes microtubules to paclitaxel to the level, observed in the conventional assay. Interestingly, a minimal fragment of MAP called CLASP2, a previously characterized rescue factor, has a strong effect on microtubule rescues, regardless of the type of assay. Overall, our study underscores the role of microtubule damage in promoting rescues and highlights the utility of the in vitro pedestal assay to study microtubule dynamics modulation by tubulin inhibitors and MAPs.

Abstract: How cells utilize complex mixtures of actin binding proteins to assemble and maintain functionally diverse actin filament networks with distinct architectures and dynamics within a common cytoplasm is a longstanding question in cell biology. A compelling example of complex and specialized actin structures in cells are filopodia which sense extracellular chemical and mechanical signals to help steer motile cells. Filopodia have distinct actin architecture, composed of long, parallel actin filaments bundled by fascin, which form finger-like membrane protrusions. Elongation of the parallel actin filaments in filopodia can be mediated by two processive actin filament elongation factors, formin and Ena/VASP, which localize to the tips of filopodia. There remains debate as to how the architecture of filopodia are generated, with one hypothesis proposing that filopodia are generated from the lamellipodia, which consists of densely packed, branched actin filaments nucleated by Arp2/3 complex and kept short by capping protein. It remains unclear if different actin filament elongation factors are necessary and sufficient to facilitate the emergence of filopodia with diverse characteristics from a highly dense network of short-branched capped filaments. To address this question, we combined bead motility and micropatterning biomimetic assays with multi-color Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy imaging, to successfully reconstitute the formation of filopodia-like networks (FLN) from densely-branched lamellipodia-like networks (LLN) with eight purified proteins (actin, profilin, Arp2/3 complex, Wasp pWA, fascin, capping protein, VASP and formin mDia2). Saturating capping protein concentrations inhibit FLN assembly, but the addition of either formin or Ena/VASP differentially rescues the formation of FLN from LLN. Specifically, we found that formin/mDia2-generated FLNs are relatively long and lack capping protein, whereas VASP-generated FLNs are comparatively short and contain capping protein, indicating that the actin elongation factor can affect the architecture and composition of FLN emerging from LLN. Our biomimetic reconstitution systems reveal that formin or VASP are necessary and sufficient to induce the transition from a LLN to a FLN, and establish robust in vitro platforms to investigate FLN assembly mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Earth-abundant Cu2BaSnS4-xSex (CBTSSe) represents a recent alternative for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 for solar energy conversion with a lower level of disorder and band tailing. We report the heterogeneous excited-state and trap-state pattern in different solution-processed CBTSSe films using ultrafast two-color pump-probe diffuse reflectance microscopic imaging. The spectroscopy/microscopy method can visualize and correlate the microscopic compositional and electronic variations (i.e., trap states) in real space with time-resolved photophysics. Heterogeneity patterns in TAM images show that some grains exhibit a positive excited-state absorption (ESA) signal, while others show negative ground-state bleaching (GSB). Our results visualize that film processing, such as air annealing and Na addition, has a clear influence on the heterogeneity of the excited-state pattern. Importantly, we report stable charge carrier over 100 ps. We applied the image principal component and histogram for quantitative analysis of TAM images to deconvolute and visualize the contribution and fingerprints of minority free carriers and sub-band-gap trapped carriers.

Abstract: Summary
Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are ideal electron transport materials for current high-efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs), but they still face several challenges due to their surface defects and catalytic characteristics. Herein, to address the shortcomings of ZnO NPs, carbon-coated ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO@C NPs) are synthesized. With high hydrophobicity and excellent UV absorption capacity, the thin carbon shell coated on the ZnO NPs can effectively passivate their surface defects, isolate the adsorption of water and oxygen, and inhibit the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Ultimately, the ZnO@C-based PM6:L8-BO OSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 17.55%, higher than that of ZnO-based devices (16.92%). What’s important, the ZnO@C NP-based OSCs show significantly enhanced air and UV stability. This work highlights the great potential of ZnO@C NPs in fabricating highly efficient, air-stable, and photo-stable OSCs.

Abstract: The multifunctional Yersinia effector YopM inhibits effector triggered immunity and increases production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-10 (IL-10) to suppress the host immune response. Previously it was shown that YopM induces IL-10 gene expression by elevating phosphorylation of the serine-threonine kinase RSK1 in the nucleus of human macrophages. Using transcriptomics, we found that YopM strongly affects expression of genes belonging to the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Further analysis revealed that YopM mediates nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Stat3 in Y. enterocolitica infected macrophages and that knockdown of Stat3 inhibited YopM-induced IL-10 gene expression. YopM-induced Stat3 translocation did not depend on autocrine IL-10, activation of RSK1 or tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. Thus, besides activation of RSK1, stimulation of nuclear translocation of Stat3 is another mechanism by which YopM increases IL-10 gene expression in macrophages.

Abstract: Introduction
In serological testing, determination of ABO grouping requires both antigen typing for A and B antigens and screening of serum or plasma for A and B antibodies. Lack of corroboration between the results of the cell and serum groupings identifies a discrepancy. Analysis of ABO blood group discrepancies was performed to determine the incidence of these discrepancies among healthy blood donors and oncology patients.
Materials and methods
ABO discrepancies found during testing of blood samples from blood donors and patients in an oncology centre in the period from January 2015 to December 2018 were analysed. ABO blood grouping was performed using the column agglutination test. Detailed serological workups were carried out to resolve discrepancies.
Results
During the study period, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on a large dataset comprising 76,604 blood donor samples and 134,964 patient samples. Of these samples, 117 ABO discrepancies were identified with 13 occurring in blood donor samples and 104 in patient samples. The results demonstrated discrepancies caused by weakened/missing antibodies, weakened/missing antigens, panagglutination and miscellaneous factors in the blood donor samples, with percentages of 0%, 38%, 8%, and 31%, respectively. In patient samples, the percentages were 24%, 27%, 26%, and 15%, respectively.
Conclusion
Weakened/missing antigen discrepancies were the prevalent type in both blood donor and patient samples. For accurate blood group reporting and management of transfusion needs of patients, a complete serological workup is vital to resolve any blood group discrepancies.

Abstract: Summary
The efficiency of small-area perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells is already above 30%; however, there are few studies about large-area tandem cells. One main challenge for the upscaling of perovskite-silicon tandems is the non-uniformity of perovskites across large areas of tandem cells that can cause shunting, which becomes more serious when large-area tandems are fabricated via a solution process. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of efficient large-area tandems on industry-compatible Czochralski-grown and chemically etched rough silicon wafers using a blading process. We employed a lithium fluoride (LiF) interlayer to significantly mitigate the shunting issue for large-area tandems when it is deposited on the hole transport layer side. The LiF interlayer decreases local current drains and improves interfacial contact at the buried perovskite interface. As a result, a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 25.1% is achieved for tandem devices with a large aperture area of 24 cm2.

Abstract: Summary
The redox balance in tumor and diseased cells often leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Many ROS-responsive materials based on sulfur oxidation have been reported with the goal of achieving controlled delivery at the tumor. However, these materials often lack responsiveness to low ROS concentrations present in the tumor environment. To address this, we use organocatalysis to achieve an enhanced response of thioether-based nanocarriers triggered by low concentrations of ROS. Using block copolymer micelles that can disassemble through thioether oxidation followed by ester hydrolysis, this work shows how an in-situ-formed imine oxidation catalyst can enhance disassembly kinetics at low millimolar hydrogen peroxide concentrations. The results show that with organocatalysis, Nile Red-loaded micelles release their cargo twice as fast compared to uncatalyzed conditions. This study highlights the potential of organocatalysis as a valuable strategy to enhance the responsiveness of biomarker-triggered delivery systems.

Abstract: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Auto-HSCT) is widely used in the treatment of patients with hematological neoplasms. Since these cells circulate in small quantities in the periphery, the use of regimens that promote their mobilization is essential. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of using intermediate doses of cytarabine (1.6 g/m²) + filgrastim (10 mcg/kg/day) in the mobilization of stem cells in 157 patients treated by the Unified Health System at the Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Service of the Hospital Real Português de Beneficência, in Recife, Pernambuco. The sample included patients with multiple myeloma (MM) (58.6 %), lymphomas (29.9 %), and other neoplasms (11.5 %). The target of 2.0 × 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg was achieved by 148 (94.3 %) patients, in most cases (84.1 %) in a single apheresis and the median number of cells collected was 9.5 × 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. No episode of febrile neutropenia was observed, however, 79 patients (50.3 %) required platelet transfusion (no cases attributed to bleeding). The median engraftment time was 11 days. Given these results, we suggest that the use of intermediate doses of cytarabine, combined with filgrastim, is safe and effective in mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).

Abstract: Summary
Aqueous amino acids are promising absorbents for direct air capture (DAC) of CO2. Herein, we investigate the possibility of kinetic control of CO2 absorption with aqueous anionic glycine (GLY−) by employing extensive ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, free energy analysis, and reaction rate theory. We find that first GLY− binds to CO2 by overcoming a barrier (7.4 kcal/mol) to form a zwitterion intermediate, which then releases a proton by overcoming a similar barrier. Despite the similarity in the barrier, zwitterion formation appears to be the rate-limiting step because it is two orders of magnitude slower (microseconds) than the proton release step. This is predominantly due to stronger nonequilibrium solvent effects for the former that cause many barrier-recrossing events and effectively slow down the reaction rate. Such a detailed fundamental understanding of the amino acid-based CO2-absorption mechanism and rates is key to improving the kinetic efficiency of DAC technology.

Abstract: Summary
Horns from the Bovidae family represent extremely tough natural composites that resist flexural and impact damage during combat. However, the microstructure characteristics of these horns’ sheaths and how this affects their mechanical properties remain to be explored. In this work, we report that the Syncerus caffer horn sheath exhibits the highest tensile strength of 183 MPa and fracture energy of 36.8 MJ m−3, superior to other reported bulk natural materials. Comprehensive structure characterizations pin down the key factors of the horn sheath as the corrugated lamellae morphology. Finite-element modeling verifies that the critical characteristics of curved corrugated lamellae have a profound effect on the flexural and impact behavior. Furthermore, the ridge region for the highly curved lamellar morphology corresponds to greater disulfide crosslinking with ∼2.6% sulfur, suggesting a purposeful evolution of the heterogeneous composition. This work aims to provide insights into the bio-inspired design of superior structural materials.

Abstract: Summary
Rare-earth doping is an efficient strategy to elevate the oxygen evolution reaction activity of transition-metal-based electrocatalysts, yet it often leads to deleterious electrochemical corrosion. Here, we introduce non-layered dysprosium oxysulfide (Dy2O2S) to a cobalt catalyst to address this issue. Benefiting from an electron-withdrawing Dy2O2S shell, the optimum chainmail-structured catalyst displays low overpotentials of 225 ± 1 and 299 ± 5 mV at 0.1 and 1.0 A·cm−2, respectively, for the oxygen evolution reaction under industrially relevant conditions. Moreover, Dy2O2S blocks the dissolution of dysprosium and cobalt, endowing the catalyst with almost 100% activity retention for at least 120 h at 1 A·cm−2. A variety of in situ/ex situ characterization techniques and theoretical calculations unveil the active sites and the interfacial electron redistribution, which facilitate the oxygen intermediate adsorption and oxygen desorption. This work provides a route to utilize rare-earth elements to optimize the performance of electrocatalysts.

Abstract: Introduction
This study evaluated outcomes and risk factors for COVID-19 in 91 Brazilian multiple myeloma (MM) patients between April 2020 and January 2022.
Results
Of the 91 MM patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 64% had comorbidities and 66% required hospitalization due to COVID-19, with 44% needing ventilatory support and 37% intensive care. Age (OR 2.02; 95%CI 1.02 – 7.7) and hypertension OR 4.5; 95%CI 1.3 – 15.5) were independently associated with hospitalization and certain MM therapies (corticosteroids and monoclonal drugs) were associated with ventilatory support (OR 4.3; 95%CI 1.3 – 14 and OR 5.7; 95%CI 1.8 – 18, respectively), while corticosteroids and immunomodulatory drugs were linked to ICU admission (OR 5.1; 95% CI 1.4 – 18 and OR 3.4; 95%CI 1.1 – 10, respectively). The overall mortality rate was 30%, with the highest rate observed in the ICU (73%). Additionally, the ECOG performance status was linked to increased mortality (OR 11.5; 95%CI 1.9 – 69). The MM treatment was delayed in 63% of patients who recovered from COVID-19.
Conclusions
The findings highlight the need for preventing COVID-19 and prioritizing vaccination among MM patients, as they have high rates of severe outcomes in the event of COVID-19. It is also essential to monitor the potential clinical impacts of COVID-19 on MM patients in the long-term. Given the limited resources available in treating MM patients in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic, outcomes might be worse in this population.

Abstract: Summary
Polysulfide shuttle and lithium dendrite formation limit practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. To address these issues, we propose a nacre-inspired design of MXene/aramid nanofiber (ANF) separator with "brick-and-mortar" microstructure. The combination of shortened ion transfer distance generated by holes on MXene and enlarged interlayer spacing provided by ANFs creates a hierarchical ion path "highway" that modulates the efficiency of ion transportation while synergistically suppressing the polysulfide shuttles. Furthermore, benefitting from the introduction of ANF, the composite membrane has good mechanical properties and impact tolerance. With simultaneous mitigation of dendrite growth and polysulfide poisoning of anodes, the cells with nacre-inspired separator exhibited excellent rate capability to 5 C and had a possible long cycle life of 3,500+ cycles with capacity decay of 0.013% per cycle to 3 C. This work offers a membrane design strategy inspired by the structure of pearl layers, aiming to resolve materials performance challenges of high-performance energy storage.

Abstract: Summary
Non-linear optical (NLO) materials are essential in laser technology and optical information science, and finding high-quality NLO materials is a prominent topic in materials science. Here, we theoretically investigate the doping of a lithium atom into [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) with unique π structure. Two stable configurations, Li-[10]CPP and [10]CPP-Li, are obtained. Both configurations exhibit significantly improved second-order NLO properties than [10]CPP alone, with high first hyperpolarizabilities. Notably, [10]CPP-Li displays a greater first hyperpolarizability than Li-[10]CPP. Interestingly, the energy of Li-[10]CPP is lower in the gas phase than [10]CPP-Li, while the opposite is observed in water. This indicates that Li[10]CPP exhibits promising potential as a water-triggered second-order NLO molecular switch. There is one-electron transfer and non-covalent cation-π interaction between Li and [10]CPP in both Li-[10]CPP and [10]CPP-Li. Moreover, Li-[10]CPP and [10]CPP-Li show favorable thermodynamic and dynamic stabilities, making them ideal for experimental synthesis and potential applications in organic optical devices.

Abstract: Summary
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising artificial photocatalysts for photocatalytic carbon dioxide conversion due to their incorporated catalytic metal centers and intriguing structural diversity. Only a limited number of MOFs have been reported as artificial photocatalysts, however, posing a significant challenge in attaining optimal performance from these catalysts. Herein, we present a strategy for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of a Cu–DHTP MOF structure through coordination engineering. Our findings suggest that the lower oxidation state of copper active sites in Cu–DHTP leads to changes in its electronic structure. These changes enable improved absorption of solar light, faster separation of charges, and enhanced adsorption of carbon dioxide. Under solar light, Cu–DHTP exhibits a carbon monoxide production rate of 10.55 μmol g−1 h−1 with nearly 100% selectivity while requiring no co-catalysts or sacrificial agents. This rate is 11.34 times higher than the comparable MOF sample, which contains a higher oxidation copper center.

Abstract: Summary
The direct transformation of amides has attracted considerable attention in recent years, which has resulted in many valuable synthetic methods. However, the direct, catalytic decarbamoylative cross-couplings of native amides remain underexplored and challenging. Here, we demonstrate that catalytic intermolecular decarbamoylative C–C arylation and C–B borylation of N-acylpyrrole-based tertiary amides can be achieved using nickel⋅N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, yielding biaryl compounds and boronic esters, respectively. Furthermore, this method can be extended to other N-acylpyrrole-type amides, such as N-acylindoles and N-acylcarbazoles, and for the C–B borylation, to N,N-diphenyl-type amides, which act as surrogates for electrophilic aryl and alkyl partners. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of catalytic decarbamoylative functionalization of planar N-acylpyrrole-type amides. Importantly, we propose the concept of heteroaromatization (aza-aromaticity) effect to account for the high electrophilicity of planar N-acylpyrrole-type amides.

Abstract: Summary
Spectrally selective thermal emitters with narrow bandwidth and high temperature stability are of great interest for a variety of applications in the mid-infrared region, ranging from thermal imaging and infrared sensing to high-temperature thermophotovoltaics. Herein, a lithography-free, wafer-scale, aperiodic mid-wave infrared narrowband thermal emitter is proposed and optimized by inverse design. Experimental results show that a fabricated prototype emitter exhibits a narrowband thermal emissivity peak of 90% around 3.82 μm with high temperature stability up to 1,200 K. Numerical simulation analyses are employed to corroborate the experimental results. Infrared formaldehyde-gas-sensing tests are further conducted to verify the versatile functionality of the proposed emitters, and an order-of-magnitude improvement in relative sensitivity is obtained compared with that of a conventional blackbody emitter. The proposed approach can be implemented in refractory infrared light sources, allowing applications in thermal imaging and optical gas sensing.

Abstract: In vitro reconstitution assays using purified actin have greatly improved our understanding of cytoskeletal dynamics and their regulation by actin-binding proteins. However, early purification methods consisted of harsh conditions to obtain pure actin and often did not include correct maturation and obligate modification of the isolated actin monomers. Novel insights into the folding requirements and N-terminal processing of actin as well as a better understanding of the interaction of actin with monomer sequestering proteins such as DNaseI, profilin and gelsolin, led to the development of more gentle approaches to obtain pure recombinant actin isoforms with known obligate modifications. This review summarizes the approaches that can be employed to isolate natively folded endogenous and recombinant actin from tissues and cells. We further emphasize the use and limitations of each method and describe how these methods can be implemented to study actin PTMs, disease-related actin mutations and novel actin-like proteins.

Abstract: While in vitro reconstitution of cellular processes is progressing rapidly, the encapsulation of biomimetic systems to reproduce the cellular environment is a major challenge. Here we review the difficulties, using reconstitution of processes dependent on actin polymerization as an example. Some of the problems are purely technical, due to the need for engineering strategies to encapsulate concentrated solutions in micrometer-sized compartments. However, other significant issues arise from the reduction of experimental volumes, which alters the chemical evolution of these non-equilibrium systems. Important parameters to consider for successful reconstitutions are the amount of each component, their consumption and renewal rates to guarantee their continuous availability.

Abstract: Summary
Although metallacages have been widely employed as a type of efficient catalysts owing to their confined cavities, their limited stability and reusability hinder their further applications in photocatalysis. Herein, a metallacage-crosslinked supramolecular network is prepared and used as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for visible-light-driven photooxidation reactions. The integration of metallacages with polymer networks converts the homogeneous metallacage-based catalysts into heterogeneous xerogel-based catalysts, showing much improved stability, reusability, and photocatalytic activity. For the photocatalytic coupling reaction of pyrenemethylamine, the conversion and yield achieved outstanding levels of 98.5% and 95.5%, respectively, within 20 min, surpassing the performance of a porphyrin-crosslinked polymer network. This study reports a type of metallacage-crosslinked supramolecular networks as efficient heterogeneous photocatalysts, which will promote the development of metallacage-cored polymeric materials for practical catalytic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Amphibious robots face challenges in efficiently combining locomotion strategies and coordinating propulsive mechanisms, hindering their locomotion performance similar to amphibian animals. This study presents the design and implementation of an agile amphibious robot inspired by the mudskipper, a highly adaptive amphibian. This innovative robot employs fish-like locomotion underwater and legged locomotion on land to achieve high propulsion efficiency. Furthermore, the maneuverability of the robot is significantly enhanced through the coordination of the pectoral and caudal fins. Our experimental results demonstrate that the minimum cost of transport for terrestrial and aquatic locomotion is 4.56 and 2.02, respectively, outperforming many existing amphibious and unimodal robots. In addition, the robot’s terrestrial and aquatic turning speeds improved by 50.1% and 24.4%, respectively, owing to the effective coordination of the pectoral and caudal fins. Our amphibious robot has great potential for diverse applications and provides valuable insights for the development of advanced and versatile robotic systems.

Abstract: Summary
Oxygen reduction reaction through the two-electron pathway holds promise for on-site hydrogen peroxide production; however, achieving high activity without compromising selectivity remains a long-standing challenge in catalyst design. Herein, we overcome this challenge by engineering a solid-liquid-gas three-phase interface that creates a hydrophobic microenvironment to enhance interfacial mass and electron transfer while retaining active sites. The engineered vertical graphene electrode exhibits greater than 97% Faradaic efficiency in alkaline media and greater than 90% Faradaic efficiency in neutral media, both at a large potential window (0.7–1.0 V). Continuous hydrogen peroxide production at 1,200 mg L−1 h−1 is achieved in a flow cell with neutral medium utilizing the engineered electrode. Kelvin probe force microscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal that graphene step edges possess a low work function that promotes two-electron reaction kinetics, while ab initio molecular dynamics show that the hydrophobic three-phase interface microenvironment balances the contact of graphene edges, oxygen, and water.

Abstract: Summary
Solar water splitting has the potential to significantly contribute to future greenhouse-gas-free fuels. In photoelectrochemical water splitting, the solar absorber is in direct contact with the aqueous electrolyte. This enables a higher level of device integration, but it also creates additional challenges when compared to decoupled photovoltaics-electrolysis approaches. Here, we report on the design of a photoelectrochemical Schlenk cell processing routine that allows photoelectrochemical interface functionalization under controlled conditions. Interface inhomogeneities that accelerate corrosion are hereby reduced, while the photoelectrochemical window layer from the functionalization reduces voltage and light absorption losses for the photoelectrode. Applied to a dual-junction GaInP/GaAs photoelectrode, we demonstrate solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies of up to 18.8% on increased electrode areas and longer unbiased electrode lifetimes compared to similar previous work. This general processing approach should be transferable to other systems where photoelectrochemical functionalization with optical in situ control is desirable.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising energy-storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density. However, LSBs’ practical energy density is limited by a large electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratio (>5 μL mg−1 S), and their reversible operation encounters challenges from electrode passivation and Li dendrite formation. Herein, we report a strategy for enhancing LSBs’ performance by using a cationic surfactant-based electrolyte additive: tetramethylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TAHP). The stronger electrostatic interaction between the tetramethylammonium cation and the short-chain polysulfide (PS) anion promotes the reduction of long-chain PS to short-chain PS, inducing 3D particulate deposition of Li2S and thus increasing both sulfur utilization and discharge potential, alleviating electrode passivation. Moreover, tetramethylammonium cations can adsorb around Li protrusions to form a lithiophobic protective layer that inhibits the formation of Li dendrites. As a result, the TAHP lithium-sulfur pouch cell maintained an excellent capacity retention ratio with 78.3% after 250 cycles under lean-electrolyte conditions (4.5 μL mg−1 sufur [S]).

Abstract: Background
Immunosuppressive therapy is the standard management of adults with aplastic anaemia. Antithymocyte globulin is used as first-line treatment of patients not eligible for bone marrow transplantation. This being a rare disease, available evidence in India is scarce. This study aimed to present experience in treating adult aplastic anaemia patients by immunosuppressive therapy using antithymocyte globulin-equine (Thymogam) in two tertiary care centres of northeast India.
Methods
This case series was conducted at the Health city hospital, Guwahati, and Excel Care Hospital, Guwahati from 2018 to 2020. Eighteen adult aplastic anaemia patients who were treated by immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin-equine (Thymogam) and followed up for two years were included. Treatment response and relapse are described.
Results
All the 18 patients, (14 severe, four very severe) were uniformly treated with immunosuppressive therapy (Thymogam 40 mg/kg/d for four days with oral Cyclosporine from Day-1). Cyclosporin A was used as a concomitant drug in 94.44 % of the patients. At two years of follow up, 66.7 % showed a response and the mortality rate was 11.1 %.
Conclusion
The results of this case series substantiate the effectiveness of immunosuppressive therapy with a low-cost preparation of horse antithymocyte globulin (Thymogam) along with cyclosporin A in the management of aplastic anaemia patients not suitable for bone marrow transplantation.

Abstract: The study of virulence of Legionella pneumophila and its interactions with its hosts has been predominantly conducted in cellulo in the past decades. Although easy to implement and allowing the dissection of molecular pathways underlying host-pathogen interactions, these cellular models fail to provide conditions of the complex environments encountered by the bacteria during the infection of multicellular organisms. To improve our understanding of human infection, several animal models have been developed. This review provides an overview of the invertebrate and vertebrate models that have been established to study L. pneumophila infection and that are alternatives to the classical mouse model, which does not recall human infection with L. pneumophila well. Finally we provide insight in the main contributions made by these models along with their pros and cons.
