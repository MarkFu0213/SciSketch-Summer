Abstract: Summary
Excitation-inhibition imbalance in neural networks is widely linked to neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, how genetic factors alter neuronal activity, leading to excitation-inhibition imbalance, remains unclear. Here, using the C. elegans locomotor circuit, we examine how altering neuronal activity for varying time periods affects synaptic release pattern and animal behavior. We show that while short-duration activation of excitatory cholinergic neurons elicits a reversible enhancement of presynaptic strength, persistent activation results to asynchronous and reduced cholinergic drive, inducing imbalance between endogenous excitation and inhibition. We find that the neuronal calcium sensor protein NCS-2 is required for asynchronous cholinergic release in an activity-dependent manner and dampens excitability of inhibitory neurons non-cell autonomously. The function of NCS-2 requires its Ca2+ binding and membrane association domains. These results reveal a synaptic mechanism implicating asynchronous release in regulation of excitation-inhibition balance.

Abstract: Summary
Human immune systems are variable, and immune responses are often unpredictable. Systems-level analyses offer increased power to sort patients on the basis of coordinated changes across immune cells and proteins. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a well-established form of immunotherapy whereby a donor immune system induces a graft-versus-leukemia response. This fails when the donor immune system regenerates improperly, leaving the patient susceptible to infections and leukemia relapse. We present a systems-level analysis by mass cytometry and serum profiling in 26 patients sampled 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation. Using a combination of machine learning and topological data analyses, we show that global immune signatures associated with clinical outcome can be revealed, even when patients are few and heterogeneous. This high-resolution systems immune monitoring approach holds the potential for improving the development and evaluation of immunotherapies in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are single-stranded RNAs that are joined head to tail with largely unknown functions. Here we show that transfection of purified in vitro generated circRNA into mammalian cells led to potent induction of innate immunity genes and confers protection against viral infection. The nucleic acid sensor RIG-I is necessary to sense foreign circRNA, and RIG-I and foreign circRNA co-aggregate in cytoplasmic foci. CircRNA activation of innate immunity is independent of a 5′ triphosphate, double-stranded RNA structure, or the primary sequence of the foreign circRNA. Instead, self-nonself discrimination depends on the intron that programs the circRNA. Use of a human intron to express a foreign circRNA sequence abrogates immune activation, and mature human circRNA is associated with diverse RNA binding proteins reflecting its endogenous splicing and biogenesis. These results reveal innate immune sensing of circRNA and highlight introns—the predominant output of mammalian transcription—as arbiters of self-nonself identity.

Abstract: Summary
T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming with major changes in cellular energy metabolism during activation. In patients with mitochondrial disease, clinical data were marked by frequent infections and immunodeficiency, prompting us to explore the consequences of oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction in T cells. Since cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a critical regulator of OXPHOS, we created a mouse model with isolated dysfunction in T cells by targeting a gene, COX10, that produces mitochondrial disease in humans. COX dysfunction resulted in increased apoptosis following activation in vitro and immunodeficiency in vivo. Select T cell effector subsets were particularly affected; this could be traced to their bioenergetic requirements. In summary, the findings presented herein emphasize the role of COX particularly in T cells as a metabolic checkpoint for cell fate decisions following T cell activation, with heterogeneous effects in T cell subsets. In addition, our studies highlight the utility of translational models that recapitulate human mitochondrial disease for understanding immunometabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase VPS34 plays a key role in the regulation of vesicular trafficking and macroautophagy. So far, we know little about the molecular mechanism of VPS34 activation besides its interaction with regulatory proteins to form complexes. Here, we report that VPS34 is specifically acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300, and p300-mediated acetylation represses VPS34 activity. Acetylation at K771 directly diminishes the affinity of VPS34 for its substrate PI, while acetylation at K29 hinders the VPS34-Beclin 1 core complex formation. Inactivation of p300 induces VPS34 deacetylation, PI3P production, and autophagy, even in AMPK−/−, TSC2−/−, or ULK1−/− cells. In fasting mice, liver autophagy correlates well with p300 inactivation/VPS34 deacetylation, which facilitates the clearance of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Thus, p300-dependent VPS34 acetylation/deacetylation is the physiological key to VPS34 activation, which controls the initiation of canonical autophagy and of non-canonical autophagy in which the upstream kinases of VPS34 can be bypassed.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to respond to available nutrients is critical for all living cells. The AMP-activated protein kinase (SNF1 in yeast) is a central regulator of metabolism that is activated when energy is depleted. We found that SNF1 activity in the nucleus is regulated by controlled relocalization of the SNF1 activator Std1 into puncta. This process is regulated by glucose through the activity of the previously uncharacterized protein kinase Vhs1 and its substrate Sip5, a protein of hitherto unknown function. Phosphorylation of Sip5 prevents its association with Std1 and triggers Std1 accretion. Reversible Std1 puncta formation occurs under non-stressful, ambient conditions, creating non-amyloid inclusion bodies at the nuclear-vacuolar junction, and it utilizes cellular chaperones similarly to the aggregation of toxic or misfolded proteins such as those associated with Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and CJD diseases. Our results reveal a controlled, non-pathological, physiological role of protein aggregation in the regulation of a major metabolic cellular pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Plasma metabolite concentrations reflect the activity of tissue metabolic pathways and their quantitative determination may be informative about pathogenic conditions. We searched for plasma lipid species whose concentrations correlate with various parameters of glucose homeostasis and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Shotgun lipidomic analysis of the plasma of mice from different genetic backgrounds, which develop a pre-diabetic state at different rates when metabolically stressed, led to the identification of a group of sphingolipids correlated with glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. Quantitative analysis of these and closely related lipids in the plasma of individuals from two population-based prospective cohorts revealed that specific long-chain fatty-acid-containing dihydroceramides were significantly elevated in the plasma of individuals who will progress to diabetes up to 9 years before disease onset. These lipids may serve as early biomarkers of, and help identify, metabolic deregulation in the pathogenesis of T2D.

Abstract: Summary
Neuromodulatory cells transduce environmental information into long-lasting behavioral responses. However, the mechanisms governing how neuronal cells influence behavioral plasticity are difficult to characterize. Here, we adapted the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) approach in C. elegans to profile ribosome-associated mRNAs from three major tissues and the neuromodulatory dopaminergic and serotonergic cells. We identified elc-2, an Elongin C ortholog, specifically expressed in stress-sensing amphid neuron dual ciliated sensory ending (ADF) serotonergic sensory neurons, and we found that it plays a role in mediating a long-lasting change in serotonin-dependent feeding behavior induced by heat stress. We demonstrate that ELC-2 and the von Hippel-Lindau protein VHL-1, components of an Elongin-Cullin-SOCS box (ECS) E3 ubiquitin ligase, modulate this behavior after experiencing stress. Also, heat stress induces a transient redistribution of ELC-2, becoming more nuclearly enriched. Together, our results demonstrate dynamic regulation of an E3 ligase and a role for an ECS complex in neuromodulation and control of lasting behavioral states.

Abstract: Summary
The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine elicits a long-lasting antidepressant response in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Understanding how antagonism of NMDARs alters synapse and circuit function is pivotal to developing circuit-based therapies for depression. Using virally induced gene deletion, ex vivo optogenetic-assisted circuit analysis, and in vivo chemogenetics and fMRI, we assessed the role of NMDARs in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in controlling depression-related behavior in mice. We demonstrate that post-developmental genetic deletion of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B from pyramidal neurons in the mPFC enhances connectivity between the mPFC and limbic thalamus, but not the ventral hippocampus, and reduces depression-like behavior. Using intersectional chemogenetics, we show that activation of this thalamocortical circuit is sufficient to elicit a decrease in despair-like behavior. Our findings reveal that GluN2B exerts input-specific control of pyramidal neuron innervation and identify a medial dorsal thalamus (MDT)→mPFC circuit that controls depression-like behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin regulation is a principal mechanism governing animal development, yet it is unclear to what extent structural changes in chromatin underlie tissue regeneration. Non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish activate cardiomyocyte (CM) division after tissue damage to regenerate lost heart muscle. Here, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing a biotinylatable H3.3 histone variant in CMs and derived cell-type-specific profiles of histone replacement. We identified an emerging program of putative enhancers that revise H3.3 occupancy during regeneration, overlaid upon a genome-wide reduction of H3.3 from promoters. In transgenic reporter lines, H3.3-enriched elements directed gene expression in subpopulations of CMs. Other elements increased H3.3 enrichment and displayed enhancer activity in settings of injury- and/or Neuregulin1-elicited CM proliferation. Dozens of consensus sequence motifs containing predicted transcription factor binding sites were enriched in genomic regions with regeneration-responsive H3.3 occupancy. Thus, cell-type-specific regulatory programs of tissue regeneration can be revealed by genome-wide H3.3 profiling.

Abstract: Summary
We previously developed a mass spectrometry-based method, dynamic organellar maps, for the determination of protein subcellular localization and identification of translocation events in comparative experiments. The use of metabolic labeling for quantification (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture [SILAC]) renders the method best suited to cells grown in culture. Here, we have adapted the workflow to both label-free quantification (LFQ) and chemical labeling/multiplexing strategies (tandem mass tagging [TMT]). Both methods are highly effective for the generation of organellar maps and capture of protein translocations. Furthermore, application of label-free organellar mapping to acutely isolated mouse primary neurons provided subcellular localization and copy-number information for over 8,000 proteins, allowing a detailed analysis of organellar organization. Our study extends the scope of dynamic organellar maps to any cell type or tissue and also to high-throughput screening.

Abstract: Summary
Ca2+ dynamics and oxidative signaling are fundamental mechanisms for mitochondrial bioenergetics and cell function. The MCU complex is the major pathway by which these signals are integrated in mitochondria. Whether and how these coactive elements interact with MCU have not been established. As an approach toward understanding the regulation of MCU channel by oxidative milieu, we adapted inflammatory and hypoxia models. We identified the conserved cysteine 97 (Cys-97) to be the only reactive thiol in human MCU that undergoes S-glutathionylation. Furthermore, biochemical, structural, and superresolution imaging analysis revealed that MCU oxidation promotes MCU higher order oligomer formation. Both oxidation and mutation of MCU Cys-97 exhibited persistent MCU channel activity with higher [Ca2+]m uptake rate, elevated mROS, and enhanced [Ca2+]m overload-induced cell death. In contrast, these effects were largely independent of MCU interaction with its regulators. These findings reveal a distinct functional role for Cys-97 in ROS sensing and regulation of MCU activity.

Abstract: Summary
Low inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability causes terminal differentiation of the root apical meristem (RAM), a phenomenon known as root meristem exhaustion or determined growth. Here, we report that the CLE14 peptide acts as a key player in this process. Low Pi stress induces iron mobilization in the RAM through the action of LPR1/LPR2, causing expression of CLE14 in the proximal meristem region. CLV2 and PEPR2 receptors perceive CLE14 and trigger RAM differentiation, with concomitant downregulation of SHR/SCR and PIN/AUXIN pathway. Our results reveal multiple steps of the molecular mechanism of one of the most physiologically important root nutrient responses.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1)/Smad4 signaling plays a pivotal role in maintenance of the dynamic balance between bone formation and resorption. The microRNA miR-155 has been reported to exert a significant role in the differentiation of macrophage and dendritic cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether miR-155 regulates osteoclast differentiation through TGFβ1/Smad4 signaling. Here, we present that TGFβ1 elevated miR-155 levels during osteoclast differentiation through the stimulation of M-CSF and RANKL. Additionally, we found that silencing Smad4 attenuated the upregulation of miR-155 induced by TGFβ1. The results of luciferase reporter experiments and ChIP assays demonstrated that TGFβ1 promoted the binding of Smad4 to the miR-155 promoter at a site located in 454 bp from the transcription start site in vivo, further verifying that miR-155 is a transcriptional target of the TGFβ1/Smad4 pathway. Subsequently, TRAP staining and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that silencing Smad4 impaired the TGFβ1-mediated inhibition on osteoclast differentiation. Finally, we found that miR-155 may target SOCS1 and MITF to suppress osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, we provide the first evidence that TGFβ1/Smad4 signaling affects osteoclast differentiation by regulation of miR-155 expression and the use of miR-155 as a potential therapeutic target for osteoclast-related diseases shows great promise.

Abstract: Summary
To conduct comprehensive characterization of molecular properties in organisms, we established an efficient method to produce knockout (KO)-rescue mice within a single generation. We applied this method to produce 20 strains of almost completely embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived mice (“ES mice”) rescued with wild-type and mutant Cry1 gene under a Cry1−/−:Cry2−/− background. A series of both phosphorylation-mimetic and non-phosphorylation-mimetic CRY1 mutants revealed that multisite phosphorylation of CRY1 can serve as a cumulative timer in the mammalian circadian clock. KO-rescue ES mice also revealed that CRY1-PER2 interaction confers a robust circadian rhythmicity in mice. Surprisingly, in contrast to theoretical predictions from canonical transcription/translation feedback loops, the residues surrounding the flexible P loop and C-lid domains of CRY1 determine circadian period without changing the degradation rate of CRY1. These results suggest that CRY1 determines circadian period through both its degradation-dependent and -independent pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancer-derived RNAs are thought to act locally by contributing to their parent enhancer function. Whether large domains of clustered enhancers (super-enhancers) also produce cis-acting RNAs, however, remains unclear. Unlike typical enhancers, super-enhancers form large spans of robustly transcribed chromatin, amassing capped and polyadenylated RNAs that are sufficiently abundant to sustain trans functions. Here, we show that one such RNA, alncRNA-EC7/Bloodlinc, is transcribed from a super-enhancer of the erythroid membrane transporter SLC4A1/BAND3 but diffuses beyond this site. Bloodlinc localizes to trans-chromosomal loci encoding critical regulators and effectors of terminal erythropoiesis and directly binds chromatin-organizing and transcription factors, including the chromatin attachment factor HNRNPU. Inhibiting Bloodlinc or Hnrnpu compromises the terminal erythropoiesis gene program, blocking red cell production, whereas expressing Bloodlinc ectopically stimulates this program and can promote erythroblast proliferation and enucleation in the absence of differentiation stimuli. Thus, Bloodlinc is a trans-acting super-enhancer RNA that potentiates red blood cell development.

Abstract: Summary
Investigation of cell-cycle kinetics in mammalian pancreatic β cells has mostly focused on transition from the quiescent (G0) to G1 phase. Here, we report that centromere protein A (CENP-A), which is required for chromosome segregation during the M-phase, is necessary for adaptive β cell proliferation. Receptor-mediated insulin signaling promotes DNA-binding activity of FoxM1 to regulate expression of CENP-A and polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1) by modulating cyclin-dependent kinase-1/2. CENP-A deposition at the centromere is augmented by PLK1 to promote mitosis, while knocking down CENP-A limits β cell proliferation and survival. CENP-A deficiency in β cells leads to impaired adaptive proliferation in response to pregnancy, acute and chronic insulin resistance, and aging in mice. Insulin-stimulated CENP-A/PLK1 protein expression is blunted in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes. These data implicate the insulin-FoxM1/PLK1/CENP-A pathway-regulated mitotic cell-cycle progression as an essential component in the β cell adaptation to delay and/or prevent progression to diabetes.

A feature of BCG is the partial deletion of the ESX-1 type VII secretion system, which governs phagosomal rupture and cytosolic pattern recognition, key intracellular phenotypes linked to increased immune signaling. Here, by heterologously expressing the esx-1 region of Mycobacterium marinum in BCG, we engineered a low-virulence, ESX-1-proficient, recombinant BCG (BCG::ESX-1Mmar) that induces the cGas/STING/TBK1/IRF-3/type I interferon axis and enhances AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasome activity, resulting in both higher proportions of CD8+ T cell effectors against mycobacterial antigens shared with BCG and polyfunctional CD4+ Th1 cells specific to ESX-1 antigens. Importantly, independent mouse vaccination models show that BCG::ESX-1Mmar confers superior protection relative to parental BCG against challenges with highly virulent M. tuberculosis.

Abstract: Summary
Quiescent long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) are efficiently activated by type I interferon (IFN-I). However, this effect remains poorly investigated in the context of IFN-I-inducing virus infections. Here we report that both vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection induce LT-HSC activation that substantially differs from the effects triggered upon injection of synthetic IFN-I-inducing agents. In both infections, inflammatory responses had to exceed local thresholds within the bone marrow to confer LT-HSC cell cycle entry, and IFN-I receptor triggering was not critical for this activation. After resolution of acute MCMV infection, LT-HSCs returned to phenotypic quiescence. However, non-acute MCMV infection induced a sustained inflammatory milieu within the bone marrow that was associated with long-lasting impairment of LT-HSC function. In conclusion, our results show that systemic virus infections fundamentally affect LT-HSCs and that also non-acute inflammatory stimuli in bone marrow donors can affect the reconstitution potential of bone marrow transplants.

Abstract: Summary
The G protein-coupled receptor Smoothened (Smo) is the signal transducer of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway. Smo signals through G protein-dependent and -independent routes, with G protein-independent canonical signaling to Gli effectors requiring Smo accumulation in the primary cilium. The mechanisms controlling Smo activation and trafficking are not yet clear but likely entail small-molecule binding to pockets in its extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and/or transmembrane bundle. Here, we demonstrate that the cytosolic phospholipase cPLA2α is activated through Gβγ downstream of Smo to release arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid binds Smo and synergizes with CRD-binding agonists, promoting Smo ciliary trafficking and high-level signaling. Chemical or genetic cPLA2α inhibition dampens Smo signaling to Gli, revealing an unexpected contribution of G protein-dependent signaling to canonical pathway activity. Arachidonic acid displaces the Smo transmembrane domain inhibitor cyclopamine to rescue CRD agonist-induced signaling, suggesting that arachidonic acid may target the transmembrane bundle to allosterically enhance signaling by CRD agonist-bound Smo.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity represents chronic inflammatory states promoted by pro-inflammatory M1-macrophage infiltration into white adipose tissue (WAT), thereby inducing insulin resistance. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of an ER stress protein, CHOP, in determining adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) polarity and systemic insulin sensitivity. A high-fat diet (HFD) enhances ER stress with CHOP upregulation in adipocytes. CHOP deficiency prevents HFD-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance with ATM M2 predomination and Th2 cytokine upregulation in WAT. Whereas ER stress suppresses Th2 cytokine expression in cultured adipocytes, CHOP knockdown inhibits this downregulation. In contrast, macrophage responsiveness to Th1/Th2 cytokines is unchanged regardless of whether CHOP is expressed. Furthermore, bone marrow transplantation experiments showed recipient CHOP to be the major determinant of ATM polarity. Thus, CHOP in adipocytes plays important roles in ATM M1 polarization by altering WAT micro-environmental conditions, including Th2 cytokine downregulation. This molecular mechanism may link adipose ER stress with systemic insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Human skin is commonly colonized and infected by Staphylococcus aureus. Exactly how these organisms are sensed by keratinocytes has not been clearly delineated. Using a combination of metabolic and transcriptomic methodologies, we found that S. aureus infection is sensed as a metabolic stress by the hypoxic keratinocytes. This induces HIF1α signaling, which promotes IL-1β production and stimulates aerobic glycolysis to meet the metabolic requirements of infection. We demonstrate that staphylococci capable of glycolysis, including WT and agr mutants, readily induce HIF1α responses. In contrast, Δpyk glycolytic mutants fail to compete with keratinocytes for their metabolic needs. Suppression of glycolysis using 2-DG blocked keratinocyte production of IL-1β in vitro and significantly exacerbated the S. aureus cutaneous infection in a murine model. Our data suggest that S. aureus impose a metabolic stress on keratinocytes that initiates signaling necessary to promote both glycolysis and the proinflammatory response to infection.

Abstract: Summary
The biological and clinical behaviors of hematological malignancies can be influenced by the active crosstalk with an altered bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. In the present study, we provide a detailed picture of the BM vasculature in acute myeloid leukemia using intravital two-photon microscopy. We found several abnormalities in the vascular architecture and function in patient-derived xenografts (PDX), such as vascular leakiness and increased hypoxia. Transcriptomic analysis in endothelial cells identified nitric oxide (NO) as major mediator of this phenotype in PDX and in patient-derived biopsies. Moreover, induction chemotherapy failing to restore normal vasculature was associated with a poor prognosis. Inhibition of NO production reduced vascular permeability, preserved normal hematopoietic stem cell function, and improved treatment response in PDX.

Abstract: Summary
Aneuploidy disrupts cellular homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological responses and adaptation to aneuploidy are not well understood. Deciphering these mechanisms is important because aneuploidy is associated with diseases, including intellectual disability and cancer. Although tumors and mammalian aneuploid cells, including several cancer cell lines, show altered levels of sphingolipids, the role of sphingolipids in aneuploidy remains unknown. Here, we show that ceramides and long-chain bases, sphingolipid molecules that slow proliferation and promote survival, are increased by aneuploidy. Sphingolipid levels are tightly linked to serine synthesis, and inhibiting either serine or sphingolipid synthesis can specifically impair the fitness of aneuploid cells. Remarkably, the fitness of aneuploid cells improves or deteriorates upon genetically decreasing or increasing ceramides, respectively. Combined targeting of serine and sphingolipid synthesis could be exploited to specifically target cancer cells, the vast majority of which are aneuploid.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is a major human health crisis that promotes insulin resistance and, ultimately, type 2 diabetes. The molecular mechanisms that mediate this response occur across many highly complex biological regulatory levels that are incompletely understood. Here, we present a comprehensive molecular systems biology study of hepatic responses to high-fat feeding in mice. We interrogated diet-induced epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic alterations using high-throughput omic methods and used a network modeling approach to integrate these diverse molecular signals. Our model indicated that disruption of hepatic architecture and enhanced hepatocyte apoptosis are among the numerous biological processes that contribute to early liver dysfunction and low-grade inflammation during the development of diet-induced metabolic syndrome. We validated these model findings with additional experiments on mouse liver sections. In total, we present an integrative systems biology study of diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance that uncovered molecular features promoting the development and maintenance of metabolic disease.

Abstract: Summary
ATG4B stimulates autophagy by promoting autophagosome formation through reversible modification of ATG8. We identify ATG4B as a substrate of mammalian sterile20-like kinase (STK) 26/MST4. MST4 phosphorylates ATG4B at serine residue 383, which stimulates ATG4B activity and increases autophagic flux. Inhibition of MST4 or ATG4B activities using genetic approaches or an inhibitor of ATG4B suppresses autophagy and the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Furthermore, radiation induces MST4 expression, ATG4B phosphorylation, and autophagy. Inhibiting ATG4B in combination with radiotherapy in treating mice with intracranial GBM xenograft markedly slows tumor growth and provides a significant survival benefit. Our work describes an MST4-ATG4B signaling axis that influences GBM autophagy and malignancy, and whose therapeutic targeting enhances the anti-tumor effects of radiotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The objective of this study was to evaluate the specific mechanism(s) by which PPARβ regulates mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle. We discovered that PPARβ increases PGC-1α by protecting it from degradation by binding to PGC-1α and limiting ubiquitination. PPARβ also induces an increase in nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) expression, resulting in increases in mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins and MEF2A, for which NRF-1 is a transcription factor. There was also an increase in AMP kinase phosphorylation mediated by an NRF-1-induced increase in CAM kinase kinase-β (CaMKKβ). Knockdown of PPARβ resulted in large decreases in the levels of PGC-1α and mitochondrial proteins and a marked attenuation of the exercise-induced increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. In conclusion, PPARβ induces an increase in PGC-1α protein, and PPARβ is a transcription factor for NRF-1. Thus, PPARβ plays essential roles in the maintenance and adaptive increase in mitochondrial enzymes in skeletal muscle by exercise.

Abstract: Summary
During DNA replication, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) adopts a ring-shaped structure to promote processive DNA synthesis, acting as a sliding clamp for polymerases. Known posttranslational modifications function at the outer surface of the PCNA ring to favor DNA damage bypass. Here, we demonstrate that acetylation of lysine residues at the inner surface of PCNA is induced by DNA lesions. We show that cohesin acetyltransferase Eco1 targets lysine 20 at the sliding surface of the PCNA ring in vitro and in vivo in response to DNA damage. Mimicking constitutive acetylation stimulates homologous recombination and robustly suppresses the DNA damage sensitivity of mutations in damage tolerance pathways. In comparison to the unmodified trimer, structural differences are observed at the interface between protomers in the crystal structure of the PCNA-K20ac ring. Thus, acetylation regulates PCNA sliding on DNA in the presence of DNA damage, favoring homologous recombination linked to sister-chromatid cohesion.

Abstract: Summary
Rewiring of synaptic circuitry pertinent to memory formation has been associated with morphological changes in dendritic spines and with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Here, we mechanistically link these processes by uncovering a signaling pathway involving the serotonin 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), the hyaluronan receptor CD44, and the small GTPase Cdc42. We highlight a physical interaction between 5-HT7R and CD44 (identified as an MMP-9 substrate in neurons) and find that 5-HT7R stimulation increases local MMP-9 activity, triggering dendritic spine remodeling, synaptic pruning, and impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP). The underlying molecular machinery involves 5-HT7R-mediated activation of MMP-9, which leads to CD44 cleavage followed by Cdc42 activation. One important physiological consequence of this interaction includes an increase in neuronal outgrowth and elongation of dendritic spines, which might have a positive effect on complex neuronal processes (e.g., reversal learning and neuronal regeneration).

Abstract: Summary
Lineage-specific transcription factors are critical for long-range enhancer interactions, but direct or indirect contributions of architectural proteins such as CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) to enhancer function remain less clear. The LDB1 complex mediates enhancer-gene interactions at the β-globin locus through LDB1 self-interaction. We find that an LDB1-bound enhancer upstream of carbonic anhydrase 2 (Car2) activates its expression by interacting directly with CTCF at the gene promoter. Both LDB1 and CTCF are required for enhancer-Car2 looping, and the domain of LDB1 contacted by CTCF is necessary to rescue Car2 transcription in LDB1-deficient cells. Genome-wide studies and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing indicate that LDB1-CTCF enhancer looping underlies activation of a substantial fraction of erythroid genes. Our results provide a mechanism by which long-range interactions of architectural protein CTCF can be tailored to achieve a tissue-restricted pattern of chromatin loops and gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancer elements are genomic regulatory sequences that direct the selective expression of genes so that genetically identical cells can differentiate and acquire the highly specialized forms and functions required to build a functioning animal. To differentiate, cells must select from among the ∼106 enhancers encoded in the genome the thousands of enhancers that drive the gene programs that impart their distinct features. We used a genetic approach to identify transcription factors (TFs) required for enhancer selection in fibroblasts. This revealed that the broadly expressed, growth-factor-inducible TFs FOS/JUN (AP-1) play a central role in enhancer selection. FOS/JUN selects enhancers together with cell-type-specific TFs by collaboratively binding to nucleosomal enhancers and recruiting the SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex to establish accessible chromatin. These experiments demonstrate how environmental signals acting via FOS/JUN and BAF coordinate with cell-type-specific TFs to select enhancer repertoires that enable differentiation during development.

Abstract: Summary
Cold temperatures induce progenitor cells within white adipose tissue to form beige adipocytes that burn energy and generate heat; this is a potential anti-diabesity therapy. However, the potential to form cold-induced beige adipocytes declines with age. This creates a clinical roadblock to potential therapeutic use in older individuals, who constitute a large percentage of the obesity epidemic. Here we show that aging murine and human beige progenitor cells display a cellular aging, senescence-like phenotype that accounts for their age-dependent failure. Activating the senescence pathway, either genetically or pharmacologically, in young beige progenitors induces premature cellular senescence and blocks their potential to form cold-induced beige adipocytes. Conversely, genetically or pharmacologically reversing cellular aging by targeting the p38/MAPK-p16Ink4a pathway in aged mouse or human beige progenitor cells rejuvenates cold-induced beiging. This in turn increases glucose sensitivity. Collectively, these data indicate that anti-aging or senescence modalities could be a strategy to induce beiging, thereby improving metabolic health in aging humans.

Abstract: Summary
Acquisition of replicative immortality is currently regarded as essential for malignant transformation. This is achieved by activating a telomere lengthening mechanism (TLM), either telomerase or alternative lengthening of telomeres, to counter normal telomere attrition. However, a substantial proportion of some cancer types, including glioblastomas, liposarcomas, retinoblastomas, and osteosarcomas, are reportedly TLM-negative. As serial samples of human tumors cannot usually be obtained to monitor telomere length changes, it has previously been impossible to determine whether tumors are truly TLM-deficient, there is a previously unrecognized TLM, or the assay results are false-negative. Here, we show that a subset of high-risk neuroblastomas (with ∼50% 5-year mortality) lacked significant TLM activity. Cancer cells derived from these highly aggressive tumors initially had long telomeres and proliferated for >200 population doublings with ever-shorter telomeres. This indicates that prevention of telomere shortening is not always required for oncogenesis, which has implications for inhibiting TLMs for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
While molecular subgrouping has revolutionized medulloblastoma classification, the extent of heterogeneity within subgroups is unknown. Similarity network fusion (SNF) applied to genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression data across 763 primary samples identifies very homogeneous clusters of patients, supporting the presence of medulloblastoma subtypes. After integration of somatic copy-number alterations, and clinical features specific to each cluster, we identify 12 different subtypes of medulloblastoma. Integrative analysis using SNF further delineates group 3 from group 4 medulloblastoma, which is not as readily apparent through analyses of individual data types. Two clear subtypes of infants with Sonic Hedgehog medulloblastoma with disparate outcomes and biology are identified. Medulloblastoma subtypes identified through integrative clustering have important implications for stratification of future clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
RIPK3 mediates cell death and regulates inflammatory responses. Although genetic studies have suggested that RIPK3-MLKL-mediated necroptosis leads to embryonic lethality in Fadd or Caspase-8-deficient mice, the exact mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we generated Ripk3 mutant mice by altering the RIPK3 kinase domain (Ripk3Δ/Δ mice), thus abolishing its kinase activity. Ripk3Δ/Δ cells were resistant to necroptosis stimulation in vitro, and Ripk3Δ/Δ mice were protected from necroptotic diseases. Although the Ripk3Δ/Δ mutation rescued embryonic lethality in Fadd−/− embryos, Fadd−/− Ripk3Δ/Δ mice died within 1 day after birth due to massive inflammation. These results indicate that Ripk3 ablation rescues embryonic lethality in Fadd-deficient mice by suppressing two RIPK3-mediating processes: necroptosis during embryogenesis and inflammation during postnatal development in Fadd−/− mice.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical neurons are heterogeneous in their functional properties. This heterogeneity is fundamental for the processing of different features of sensory information. However, functional diversity within a local group of neurons is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that neighboring cortical neurons in layer 5 but not those of layer 4 of the rat anterior auditory field (AAF) exhibited a surprisingly high level of diversity in tonal receptive fields. In vivo whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings revealed that the diversity of frequency representation was due to a spectral mismatch between synaptic excitation and inhibition to varying degrees. The spectral distribution of excitation was skewed at different levels, whereas inhibition was homogeneous and non-skewed, similar to the summed spiking activity of local neuronal ensembles, which further enhanced diversity. Our results indicate that AAF in the auditory cortex is involved in processing auditory information in a highly refined manner that is important for complex pattern recognition.

Abstract: Summary
Effective development of host cells for therapeutic protein production is hampered by the poor characterization of cellular transfection. Here, we employed a multi-omics-based systems biotechnology approach to elucidate the genotypic and phenotypic differences between a wild-type and recombinant antibody-producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. At the genomic level, we observed extensive rearrangements in specific targeted loci linked to transgene integration sites. Transcriptional re-wiring of DNA damage repair and cellular metabolism in the antibody producer, via changes in gene copy numbers, was also detected. Subsequent integration of transcriptomic data with a genome-scale metabolic model showed a substantial increase in energy metabolism in the antibody producer. Metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics analyses revealed an elevation in long-chain lipid species, potentially associated with protein transport and secretion requirements, and a surprising stability of N-glycosylation profiles between both cell lines. Overall, the proposed knowledge-based systems biotechnology framework can further accelerate mammalian cell-line engineering in a targeted manner.

Abstract: Summary
The RASopathy neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common autosomal dominant genetic disorders. In NF1 patients, neurological issues may result from damaged myelin, and mice with a neurofibromin gene (Nf1) mutation show white matter (WM) defects including myelin decompaction. Using mouse genetics, we find that altered Nf1 gene-dose in mature oligodendrocytes results in progressive myelin defects and behavioral abnormalities mediated by aberrant Notch activation. Blocking Notch, upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or nitric oxide signaling rescues myelin defects in hemizygous Nf1 mutants, and pharmacological gamma secretase inhibition rescues aberrant behavior with no effects in wild-type (WT) mice. Concomitant pathway inhibition rescues myelin abnormalities in homozygous mutants. Notch activation is also observed in Nf1+/− mouse brains, and cells containing active Notch are increased in NF1 patient WM. We thus identify Notch as an Nf1 effector regulating myelin structure and behavior in a RASopathy and suggest that inhibition of Notch signaling may be a therapeutic strategy for NF1.

Abstract: Summary
While many tumors initially respond to chemotherapy, regrowth of surviving cells compromises treatment efficacy in the long term. The cell-biological basis of this regrowth is not understood. Here, we characterize the response of individual, patient-derived neuroblastoma cells driven by the prominent oncogene MYC to the first-line chemotherapy, doxorubicin. Combining live-cell imaging, cell-cycle-resolved transcriptomics, and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that a cell's treatment response is dictated by its expression level of MYC and its cell-cycle position prior to treatment. All low-MYC cells enter therapy-induced senescence. High-MYC cells, by contrast, disable their cell-cycle checkpoints, forcing renewed proliferation despite treatment-induced DNA damage. After treatment, the viability of high-MYC cells depends on their cell-cycle position during treatment: newborn cells promptly halt in G1 phase, repair DNA damage, and form re-growing clones; all other cells show protracted DNA repair and ultimately die. These findings demonstrate that fast-proliferating tumor cells may resist cytotoxic treatment non-genetically, by arresting within a favorable window of the cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue stores energy in the form of triglycerides. The ability to regulate triglyceride synthesis and breakdown based on nutrient status (e.g., fed versus fasted) is critical for physiological homeostasis and dysregulation of this process can contribute to metabolic disease. Whereas much is known about hormonal control of this cycle, transcriptional regulation is not well understood. Here, we show that the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) is critical for the control of adipocyte lipid turnover. Mice lacking Klf15 in adipose tissue (AK15KO) display decreased adiposity and are protected from diet-induced obesity. Mechanistic studies suggest that adipose KLF15 regulates key genes of triglyceride synthesis and inhibits lipolytic action, thereby promoting lipid storage in an insulin-dependent manner. Finally, AK15KO mice demonstrate accelerated lipolysis and altered systemic energetics (e.g., locomotion, ketogenesis) during fasting conditions. Our study identifies adipose KLF15 as an essential regulator of adipocyte lipid metabolism and systemic energy balance.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas systems defend bacteria and archaea against infection by bacteriophage and other threats. The central component of these systems are surveillance complexes that use guide RNAs to bind specific regions of foreign nucleic acids, marking them for destruction. Surveillance complexes must locate targets rapidly to ensure timely immune response, but the mechanism of this search process remains unclear. Here, we used single-molecule FRET to visualize how the type I-E surveillance complex Cascade searches DNA in real time. Cascade rapidly and randomly samples DNA through nonspecific electrostatic contacts, pausing at short PAM recognition sites that may be adjacent to the target. We identify Cascade motifs that are essential for either nonspecific sampling or positioning and readout of the PAM. Our findings provide a comprehensive structural and kinetic model for the Cascade target-search mechanism, revealing how CRISPR surveillance complexes can rapidly search large amounts of genetic material en route to target recognition.

Abstract: Summary
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is driven by the oncoprotein PML-RARα, which antagonizes myeloid differentiation and promotes APL-initiating cell self-renewal. Combined all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) or chemotherapy dramatically improves the prognosis of APL patients. Here we report that expression of pseudokinase Tribble 3 (TRIB3) associates positively with APL progression and therapeutic resistance. The elevated TRIB3 expression promotes APL by interacting with PML-RARα and suppressing its sumoylation, ubiquitylation, and degradation. This represses PML nuclear body assembly, p53-mediated senescence, and cell differentiation, and supports cellular self-renewal. Genetically inhibiting TRIB3 expression or combination of a peptide disturbing TRIB3/PML-RARα interaction with ATRA/As2O3 eradicates APL by accelerating PML-RARα degradation. Our study provides insight into APL pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic option against APL.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphorylation plays an essential role in microRNA (miRNA) processing by regulating co-factors of the miRNA biogenesis machinery. HYL1 (Hyponastic Leaves 1), a core co-factor in plant miRNA biogenesis, is a short-lived phosphoprotein. However, the precise balance and regulatory mechanism of the stability and phosphorylation of HYL1 remain unclear. Here, we show that a highly conserved PP4 (Protein Phosphatase 4) and SMEK1 (Suppressor of MEK 1) complex dephosphorylates HYL1 to promote miRNA biogenesis, by antagonizing the MAPK cascade in Arabidopsis. The smek1 mutants exhibit defective miRNA biogenesis due to accelerated degradation of HYL1. SMEK1 stabilizes HYL1 in a dual manner: SMEK1, as a suppressor, inhibits MAPK activation to attenuate HYL1 phosphorylation; SMEK1 assembles a functional PP4 to target HYL1 for dephosphorylation. Moreover, the protein level of SMEK1 is increased in response to abscisic acid. Our results provide insights into the delicate balance between a protein kinase and a phosphatase during miRNA biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Oxygen-dependent HIF1α hydroxylation and degradation are strictly controlled by PHD2. In hypoxia, HIF1α partly escapes degradation because of low oxygen availability. Here, we show that PHD2 is phosphorylated on serine 125 (S125) by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream kinase P70S6K and that this phosphorylation increases its ability to degrade HIF1α. mTOR blockade in hypoxia by REDD1 restrains P70S6K and unleashes PP2A phosphatase activity. Through its regulatory subunit B55α, PP2A directly dephosphorylates PHD2 on S125, resulting in a further reduction of PHD2 activity that ultimately boosts HIF1α accumulation. These events promote autophagy-mediated cell survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. B55α knockdown blocks neoplastic growth of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo in a PHD2-dependent manner. In patients, CRC tissue expresses higher levels of REDD1, B55α, and HIF1α but has lower phospho-S125 PHD2 compared with a healthy colon. Our data disclose a mechanism of PHD2 regulation that involves the mTOR and PP2A pathways and controls tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
MyoD is a master regulator of myogenesis. Chromatin modifications required to trigger MyoD expression are still poorly described. Here, we demonstrate that the histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1a is recruited on the MyoD core enhancer upon muscle differentiation. Depletion of Lsd1 in myoblasts precludes the removal of H3K9 methylation and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II on the core enhancer, thereby preventing transcription of the non-coding enhancer RNA required for MyoD expression (CEeRNA). Consistently, Lsd1 conditional inactivation in muscle progenitor cells during embryogenesis prevented transcription of the CEeRNA and delayed MyoD expression. Our results demonstrate that LSD1 is required for the timely expression of MyoD in limb buds and identify a new biological function for LSD1 by showing that it can activate RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
Death of cochlear hair cells, which do not regenerate, is a cause of hearing loss in a high percentage of the population. Currently, no approach exists to obtain large numbers of cochlear hair cells. Here, using a small-molecule approach, we show significant expansion (>2,000-fold) of cochlear supporting cells expressing and maintaining Lgr5, an epithelial stem cell marker, in response to stimulation of Wnt signaling by a GSK3β inhibitor and transcriptional activation by a histone deacetylase inhibitor. The Lgr5-expressing cells differentiate into hair cells in high yield. From a single mouse cochlea, we obtained over 11,500 hair cells, compared to less than 200 in the absence of induction. The newly generated hair cells have bundles and molecular machinery for transduction, synapse formation, and specialized hair cell activity. Targeting supporting cells capable of proliferation and cochlear hair cell replacement could lead to the discovery of hearing loss treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Bone metastasis is a major health threat to breast cancer patients. Tumor-derived Jagged1 represents a central node in mediating tumor-stromal interactions that promote osteolytic bone metastasis. Here, we report the development of a highly effective fully human monoclonal antibody against Jagged1 (clone 15D11). In addition to its inhibitory effect on bone metastasis of Jagged1-expressing tumor cells, 15D11 dramatically sensitizes bone metastasis to chemotherapy, which induces Jagged1 expression in osteoblasts to provide a survival niche for cancer cells. We further confirm the bone metastasis-promoting function of osteoblast-derived Jagged1 using osteoblast-specific Jagged1 transgenic mouse model. These findings establish 15D11 as a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention or treatment of bone metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer. Bcl-2 and p53 represent two important nodes in apoptosis signaling pathways. We find that concomitant p53 activation and Bcl-2 inhibition overcome apoptosis resistance and markedly prolong survival in three mouse models of resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mechanistically, p53 activation negatively regulates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and activates GSK3 to modulate Mcl-1 phosphorylation and promote its degradation, thus overcoming AML resistance to Bcl-2 inhibition. Moreover, Bcl-2 inhibition reciprocally overcomes apoptosis resistance to p53 activation by switching cellular response from G1 arrest to apoptosis. The efficacy, together with the mechanistic findings, reveals the potential of simultaneously targeting these two apoptosis regulators and provides a rational basis for clinical testing of this therapeutic approach.

Abstract: Summary
Srs2 is a superfamily 1 (SF1) helicase and antirecombinase that is required for genome integrity. However, the mechanisms that regulate Srs2 remain poorly understood. Here, we visualize Srs2 as it acts upon single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) bound by the Rad51 recombinase. We demonstrate that Srs2 is a processive translocase capable of stripping thousands of Rad51 molecules from ssDNA at a rate of ∼50 monomers/s. We show that Srs2 is recruited to RPA clusters embedded between Rad51 filaments and that multimeric arrays of Srs2 assemble during translocation on ssDNA through a mechanism involving iterative Srs2 loading events at sites cleared of Rad51. We also demonstrate that Srs2 acts on heteroduplex DNA joints through two alternative pathways, both of which result in rapid disruption of the heteroduplex intermediate. On the basis of these findings, we present a model describing the recruitment and regulation of Srs2 as it acts upon homologous recombination intermediates.

Abstract: The transient receptor potential canonical channel 5 (TRPC5) is a Ca2+-permeable ion channel, which is predominantly expressed in the brain. TRPC5-deficient mice exhibit a reduced innate fear response and impaired motor control. In addition, outgrowth of hippocampal and cerebellar neurons is retarded by TRPC5. However, pharmacological evidence of TRPC5 function on cellular or organismic levels is sparse. Thus, there is still a need for identifying novel and efficient TRPC5 channel modulators. We, therefore, screened compound libraries and identified the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone and N-[3-(adamantan-2-yloxy)propyl]-3-(6-methyl-1,1-dioxo-2H-1λ6,2,4-benzothiadiazin-3-yl)propanamide (BTD) as novel TRPC5 activators. Comparisons with closely related chemical structures from the same libraries indicate important substructures for compound efficacy. Methylprednisolone activates TRPC5 heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells with an EC50 of 12μM, while BTD-induced half-maximal activation is achieved with 5-fold lower concentrations, both in Ca2+ assays (EC50=1.4μM) and in electrophysiological whole cell patch clamp recordings (EC50=1.3 μM). The activation resulting from both compounds is long lasting, reversible and sensitive to clemizole, a recently established TRPC5 inhibitor. No influence of BTD on homotetrameric members of the remaining TRPC family was observed. On the main sensory TRP channels (TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPM3, TRPM8) BTD exerts only minor activity. Furthermore, BTD can activate heteromeric channel complexes consisting of TRPC5 and its closest relatives TRPC1 or TRPC4, suggesting a high selectivity of BTD for channel complexes bearing at least one TRPC5 subunit.

Abstract: The spermatozoon of the Carib grackle, Quiscalus lugubris, a member of the family Icteridae, is generally similar in organization to the passerine-type of spermatozoon, in being highly elongated and displaying a helical structure of the acrosome, nucleus and principal piece of the tail. There are subtle variations in acrosomal structural features between this organelle in the grackle and that in some of the very few passerine species of birds in which the spermatozoon has been studied. The proximal centriole is present, and, thus, the Carib grackle is the third passeridan bird in which this organelle, hitherto regarded as absent in passerine birds, has been described in the spermatozoon. The spermatozoon of this bird also possesses a granular helix, which feature has been found variably even in the scanty available reports on passerine spermatozoa. It is advocated that the spermatozoon be studied in many more species of this large clade of birds. This report provides a basis for the study of spermiogenesis in the Carib grackle, with the aim of exposing, inter alia, a number of developmental features and processes of certain organelles that have received attention, recently, in the spermatozoa of passerine birds.

Abstract: Summary
Binge eating (BE) is a common aberrant form of eating behavior, characterized by overconsumption of food in a brief period of time. Recurrent episodes of BE constitute the BE disorder, which mostly affects females and is associated with early-life adversities. Here, we show that corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)-induced prenatal stress (PNS) in late gestation predisposes female offspring to BE-like behavior that coincides with hypomethylation of hypothalamic miR-1a and downstream dysregulation of the melanocortin system through Pax7/Pax3. Moreover, exposing the offspring to a methyl-balanced diet during adolescence prevents the dysregulation and predisposition from being triggered. We demonstrate that gestational programming, per se, will not lead to BE-like behavior, but pre-existing alterations due to prenatal programming are revealed only when challenged during adolescence. We provide experimental evidence for long-term epigenetic abnormalities stemming from PNS in predisposing female offspring to BE disorder as well as a potential non-invasive prevention strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin-producing pancreatic β cells in mice can slowly regenerate from glucagon-producing α cells in settings like β cell loss, but the basis of this conversion is unknown. Moreover, it remains unclear if this intra-islet cell conversion is relevant to diseases like type 1 diabetes (T1D). We show that the α cell regulators Aristaless-related homeobox (Arx) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) maintain α cell identity in mice. Within 3 months of Dnmt1 and Arx loss, lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed extensive α cell conversion into progeny resembling native β cells. Physiological studies demonstrated that converted α cells acquire hallmark β cell electrophysiology and show glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In T1D patients, subsets of glucagon-expressing cells show loss of DNMT1 and ARX and produce insulin and other β cell factors, suggesting that DNMT1 and ARX maintain α cell identity in humans. Our work reveals pathways regulated by Arx and Dnmt1 that are sufficient for achieving targeted generation of β cells from adult pancreatic α cells.

miR-263a Regulates ENaC to Maintain Osmotic and Intestinal Stem Cell Homeostasis in Drosophila,

Abstract: Summary
Proper regulation of osmotic balance and response to tissue damage is crucial in maintaining intestinal stem cell (ISC) homeostasis. We found that Drosophila miR-263a downregulates the expression of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits in enterocytes (ECs) to maintain osmotic and ISC homeostasis. In the absence of miR-263a, the intraluminal surface of the intestine displays dehydration-like phenotypes, Na+ levels are increased in ECs, stress pathways are activated in ECs, and ISCs overproliferate. Furthermore, miR-263a mutants have increased bacterial load and expression of antimicrobial peptides. Strikingly, these phenotypes are reminiscent of the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) in which loss-of-function mutations in the chloride channel CF transmembrane conductance regulator can elevate the activity of ENaC, suggesting that Drosophila could be used as a model for CF. Finally, we provide evidence that overexpression of miR-183, the human ortholog of miR-263a, can also directly target the expressions of all three subunits of human ENaC.

Abstract: Summary
We performed genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic characterizations of uterine carcinosarcomas (UCSs). Cohort samples had extensive copy-number alterations and highly recurrent somatic mutations. Frequent mutations were found in TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, FBXW7, and KRAS, similar to endometrioid and serous uterine carcinomas. Transcriptome sequencing identified a strong epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene signature in a subset of cases that was attributable to epigenetic alterations at microRNA promoters. The range of EMT scores in UCS was the largest among all tumor types studied via The Cancer Genome Atlas. UCSs shared proteomic features with gynecologic carcinomas and sarcomas with intermediate EMT features. Multiple somatic mutations and copy-number alterations in genes that are therapeutic targets were identified.

Abstract: Summary
Translational profiling methodologies enable the systematic characterization of cell types in complex tissues, such as the mammalian brain, where neuronal isolation is exceptionally difficult. Here, we report a versatile strategy for profiling CNS cell types in a spatiotemporally restricted fashion by engineering a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus expressing an EGFP-tagged ribosomal protein (AAV-FLEX-EGFPL10a) to access translating mRNAs by translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP). We demonstrate the utility of this AAV to target a variety of genetically and anatomically defined neural populations expressing Cre recombinase and illustrate the ability of this viral TRAP (vTRAP) approach to recapitulate the molecular profiles obtained by bacTRAP in corticothalamic neurons across multiple serotypes. Furthermore, spatially restricting adeno-associated virus (AAV) injections enabled the elucidation of regional differences in gene expression within this cell type. Altogether, these results establish the broad applicability of the vTRAP strategy for the molecular dissection of any CNS or peripheral cell type that can be engineered to express Cre.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we define the landscape and dynamics of active regulatory DNA in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) by ATAC-seq. Analysis of 111 human CTCL and control samples revealed extensive chromatin signatures that distinguished leukemic, host, and normal CD4+ T cells. We identify three dominant patterns of transcription factor (TF) activation that drive leukemia regulomes, as well as TF deactivations that alter host T cells in CTCL patients. Clinical response to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) is strongly associated with a concurrent gain in chromatin accessibility. HDACi causes distinct chromatin responses in leukemic and host CD4+ T cells, reprogramming host T cells toward normalcy. These results provide a foundational framework to study personal regulomes in human cancer and epigenetic therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanisms underlying the opposing functions of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) in breast cancer development remain poorly understood. Here we report that, in breast cancer cells, liganded GR represses a large ERα-activated transcriptional program by binding, in trans, to ERα-occupied enhancers. This abolishes effective activation of these enhancers and their cognate target genes, and it leads to the inhibition of ERα-dependent binding of components of the MegaTrans complex. Consistent with the effects of SUMOylation on other classes of nuclear receptors, dexamethasone (Dex)-induced trans-repression of the estrogen E2 program appears to depend on GR SUMOylation, which leads to stable trans-recruitment of the GR-N-CoR/SMRT-HDAC3 corepressor complex on these enhancers. Together, these results uncover a mechanism by which competitive recruitment of DNA-binding nuclear receptors/transcription factors in trans to hot spot enhancers serves as an effective biological strategy for trans-repression, with clear implications for breast cancer and other diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) induces necroptosis, a type of regulated necrosis, through its kinase domain and receptor interacting protein (RIP) homotypic interaction motif (RHIM). In addition, RIPK3 has been shown to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. However, the relative contribution of these signaling pathways to RIPK3-dependent inflammation in distinct immune effectors is unknown. To investigate these questions, we generated RIPK3-GFP reporter mice. We found that colonic CD11c+CD11b+CD14+ mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) expressed the highest level of RIPK3 in the lamina propria. Consequently, deletion of the RIPK3 RHIM in CD11c+ cells alone was sufficient to impair dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-1β expression, leading to severe intestinal inflammation. In contrast, mice expressing kinase inactive RIPK3 were not hypersensitive to DSS. Thus, a key physiological function of RIPK3 is to promote reparative cytokine expression through intestinal CD11c+ MNPs in a kinase- and necroptosis-independent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Vascular normalization in tumors may improve drug delivery and anti-tumor immunity. Angiogenesis inhibitors induce hypoxia, which may facilitate malignant progression; therefore, we investigated other methods to promote vascular maturation. Here, we show that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) enhances blood flow by promoting fine vascular networks, thereby improving vascular permeability and suppressing tumor growth when combined with anti-cancer drug treatment. Six different G protein-coupled receptors have been identified as LPA receptors (LPA1–6). In studies using mutant mice, we found that LPA4 is involved in vascular network formation. LPA4 activation induces circumferential actin bundling beneath the cell membrane and enhances linear adherens junction formation by VE-cadherin in endothelial cells. Therefore, we conclude that activation of LPA4 is a promising approach for vascular regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The eukaryotic replisome is a molecular machine that coordinates the Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) replicative DNA helicase with DNA polymerases α, δ, and ε and other proteins to copy the leading- and lagging-strand templates at rates between 1 and 2 kb min−1. We have now reconstituted this sophisticated machine with purified proteins, beginning with regulated CMG assembly and activation. We show that replisome-associated factors Mrc1 and Csm3/Tof1 are crucial for in vivo rates of replisome progression. Additionally, maximal rates only occur when DNA polymerase ε catalyzes leading-strand synthesis together with its processivity factor PCNA. DNA polymerase δ can support leading-strand synthesis, but at slower rates. DNA polymerase δ is required for lagging-strand synthesis, but surprisingly also plays a role in establishing leading-strand synthesis, before DNA polymerase ε engagement. We propose that switching between these DNA polymerases also contributes to leading-strand synthesis under conditions of replicative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Central regulation of metabolic physiology is mediated critically through neuronal functions; however, whether astrocytes are also essential remains unclear. Here we show that the high-order processes of astrocytes in the mediobasal hypothalamus displayed shortening in fasting and elongation in fed status. Chronic overnutrition and astrocytic IKKβ/NF-κB upregulation similarly impaired astrocytic plasticity, leading to sustained shortening of high-order processes. In physiology, astrocytic IKKβ/NF-κB upregulation resulted in early-onset effects, including glucose intolerance and blood pressure rise, and late-onset effects, including body weight and fat gain. Appropriate inhibition in astrocytic IKKβ/NF-κB protected against chronic overnutrition impairing astrocytic plasticity and these physiological functions. Mechanistically, astrocytic regulation of hypothalamic extracellular GABA level and therefore BDNF expression were found partly accountable. Hence, astrocytic process plasticity and IKKβ/NF-κB play significant roles in central control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and body weight as well as the central induction of these physiological disorders leading to disease.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanism by which inflammation influences the adaptive response to vaccines is not fully understood. Here, we examine the role of lymph node macrophages (LNMs) in the induction of the cytokine storm triggered by inactivated influenza virus vaccine. Following vaccination, LNMs undergo inflammasome-independent necrosis-like death that is reliant on MyD88 and Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) expression and releases pre-stored interleukin-1α (IL-1α). Furthermore, activated medullary macrophages produce interferon-β (IFN-β) that induces the autocrine secretion of IL-1α. We also found that macrophage depletion promotes lymph node-resident dendritic cell (LNDC) relocation and affects the capacity of CD11b+ LNDCs to capture virus and express co-stimulatory molecules. Inhibition of the IL-1α-induced inflammatory cascade reduced B cell responses, while co-administration of recombinant IL-1α increased the humoral response. Stimulation of the IL-1α inflammatory pathway might therefore represent a strategy to enhance antigen presentation by LNDCs and improve the humoral response against influenza vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular signatures are emerging determinants of choice of therapy for lung adenocarcinomas. An evolving therapeutic approach includes targeting metabolic dependencies in cancers. Here, using an integrative approach, we have dissected the metabolic fingerprints of lung adenocarcinomas, and we show that Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in serine biosynthesis, is highly expressed in a adenocarcinoma subset with poor prognosis. This subset harbors a gene signature for DNA replication and proliferation. Accordingly, models with high levels of PHGDH display rapid proliferation, migration, and selective channeling of serine-derived carbons to glutathione and pyrimidines, while depletion of PHGDH shows potent and selective toxicity to this subset. Differential PHGDH protein levels were defined by its degradation, and the deubiquitinating enzyme JOSD2 is a regulator of its protein stability. Our study provides evidence that a unique metabolic program is activated in a lung adenocarcinoma subset, described by PHGDH, which confers growth and survival and may have therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
Motor neuron axon targeting in the periphery is correlated with the positions of motor neuron inputs in the CNS, but how these processes are coordinated to form a myotopic map remains poorly understood. We show that the LIM homeodomain factor Islet (Isl) controls targeting of both axons and dendrites in Drosophila motor neurons through regulation of the Frazzled (Fra)/DCC receptor. Isl is required for fra expression in ventrally projecting motor neurons, and isl and fra mutants have similar axon guidance defects. Single-cell labeling indicates that isl and fra are also required for dendrite targeting in a subset of motor neurons. Finally, overexpression of Fra rescues axon and dendrite targeting defects in isl mutants. These results indicate that Fra acts downstream of Isl in both the periphery and the CNS, demonstrating how a single regulatory relationship is used in multiple cellular compartments to coordinate neural circuit wiring.

Abstract: Summary
In human leukemia, lineage-specific genes represent predominant targets of deletion, with lymphoid-specific genes frequently affected in lymphoid leukemia and myeloid-specific genes in myeloid leukemia. To investigate the basis of lineage-specific alterations, we analyzed global DNA damage in primary B cell precursors expressing leukemia-inducing oncogenes by ChIP-seq. We identified more than 1,000 sensitive regions, of which B lineage-specific genes constitute the most prominent targets. Identified hotspots at B lineage genes relate to DNA-DSBs, affect genes that harbor genomic lesions in human leukemia, and associate with ectopic deletion in successfully transformed cells. Furthermore, we show that most identified regions overlap with gene bodies of highly expressed genes and that induction of a myeloid lineage phenotype in transformed B cell precursors promotes de novo DNA damage at myeloid loci. Hence, we demonstrate that lineage-specific transcription predisposes lineage-specific genes in transformed B cell precursors to DNA damage, which is likely to promote the frequent alteration of lineage-specific genes in human leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of tumor-initiating cells during colon carcinogenesis is associated with the dysregulation of Wnt signaling, which is known to act on Lgr5-positive intestinal stem cells. Here, using single-cell qPCR analysis, we identified a subset of Lgr5-positive stem cells that emerged during tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colon cancer. These tumor-specific Lgr5-positive cells expressed low levels of Ceacam1 and increased levels of a specific subset of Wnt targets and showed enhanced tumorigenicity. Among the Wnt targets that were specifically expressed, the long isoform of Tcf1 was required for the proliferation of tumor organoids and drove a unique Wnt target gene expression profile. Tcf1 expression increased at an early stage of colon carcinogenesis and was associated with the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, underscoring the importance of the induction of Tcf1 expression in generating tumorigenic colon stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
From birth onward, the lungs are exposed to the external environment and therefore harbor a complex immunological milieu to protect this organ from damage and infection. We investigated the homeostatic role of the epithelium-derived alarmin interleukin-33 (IL-33) in newborn mice and discovered the immediate upregulation of IL-33 from the first day of life, closely followed by a wave of IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), which coincided with the appearance of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and their early polarization to an IL-13-dependent anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. ILC2s contributed to lung quiescence in homeostasis by polarizing tissue resident AMs and induced an M2 phenotype in transplanted macrophage progenitors. ILC2s continued to maintain the M2 AM phenotype during adult life at the cost of a delayed response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice. These data highlight the homeostatic role of ILC2s in setting the activation threshold in the lung and underline their implications in anti-bacterial defenses.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian epiblast is formed by pluripotent cells able to differentiate into all tissues of the new individual. In their progression to differentiation, epiblast cells and their in vitro counterparts, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), transit from naive pluripotency through a differentiation-primed pluripotent state. During these events, epiblast cells and ESCs are prone to death, driven by competition between Myc-high cells (winners) and Myc-low cells (losers). Using live tracking of Myc levels, we show that Myc-high ESCs approach the naive pluripotency state, whereas Myc-low ESCs are closer to the differentiation-primed state. In ESC colonies, naive cells eliminate differentiating cells by cell competition, which is determined by a limitation in the time losers are able to survive persistent contact with winners. In the mouse embryo, cell competition promotes pluripotency maintenance by elimination of primed lineages before gastrulation. The mechanism described here is relevant to mammalian embryo development and induced pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Pre-implantation embryo development is an intricate and precisely regulated process orchestrated by maternally inherited proteins and newly synthesized proteins following zygotic genome activation. Although genomic and transcriptomic studies have enriched our understanding of the genetic programs underlying this process, the protein expression landscape remains unexplored. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified nearly 5,000 proteins from 8,000 mouse embryos of each stage (zygote, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst). We found that protein expression in zygotes, morulas, and blastocysts is distinct from 2- to 8-cell embryos. Analysis of protein phosphorylation identified critical kinases and signal transduction pathways. We highlight key factors and their important roles in embryo development. Combined analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data reveals coordinated control of RNA degradation, transcription, and translation and identifies previously undefined exon-junction-derived peptides. Our study provides an invaluable resource for further mechanistic studies and suggests core factors regulating pre-implantation embryo development.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic β and α cells play essential roles in maintaining glucose homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which these distinct cell populations are generated, expand, and mature during pancreas development remain unclear. In this study, we addressed this critical question by performing a single-cell transcriptomic analysis of mouse β and α cells sorted from fetal to adult stages. We discovered that β and α cells use different regulatory strategies for their maturation and that cell proliferation peaks at different developmental times. However, the quiescent and proliferative cells in both the β lineage and α lineage are synchronous in their maturation states. The heterogeneity of juvenile β cells reflects distinct cell-cycling phases, origins, and maturation states, whereas adult β cells are relatively homogeneous at the transcriptomic level. These analyses provide not only a high-resolution roadmap for islet lineage development but also insights into the mechanisms of cellular heterogeneity, cell number expansion, and maturation of both β and α cells.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo pathway controls organ size and tissue homeostasis through a kinase cascade leading from the Ste20-like kinase Hpo (MST1/2 in mammals) to the transcriptional coactivator Yki (YAP/TAZ in mammals). Whereas previous studies have uncovered positive and negative regulators of Hpo/MST, how they are integrated to maintain signaling homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a self-restricting mechanism whereby autophosphorylation of an unstructured linker in Hpo/MST creates docking sites for the STRIPAK PP2A phosphatase complex to inactivate Hpo/MST. Mutation of the phospho-dependent docking sites in Hpo/MST or deletion of Slmap, the STRIPAK subunit recognizing these docking sites, results in constitutive activation of Hpo/MST in both Drosophila and mammalian cells. In contrast, autophosphorylation of the Hpo/MST linker at distinct sites is known to recruit Mats/MOB1 to facilitate Hippo signaling. Thus, multisite autophosphorylation of Hpo/MST linker provides an evolutionarily conserved built-in molecular platform to maintain signaling homeostasis by coupling antagonistic signaling activities.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs play an important role in T cell responses. However, how microRNAs regulate CD8 T cell memory remains poorly defined. Here, we found that miR-150 negatively regulates CD8 T cell memory in vivo. Genetic deletion of miR-150 disrupted the balance between memory precursor and terminal effector CD8 T cells following acute viral infection. Moreover, miR-150-deficient memory CD8 T cells were more protective upon rechallenge. A key circuit whereby miR-150 repressed memory CD8 T cell development through the transcription factor c-Myb was identified. Without miR-150, c-Myb was upregulated and anti-apoptotic targets of c-Myb, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, were also increased, suggesting a miR-150-c-Myb survival circuit during memory CD8 T cell development. Indeed, overexpression of non-repressible c-Myb rescued the memory CD8 T cell defects caused by overexpression of miR-150. Overall, these results identify a key role for miR-150 in memory CD8 T cells through a c-Myb-controlled enhanced survival circuit.

Abstract: Repetitive oscillations in cytoplasmic Ca2+ due to periodic Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) drive mammalian embryo development following fertilization. Influx of extracellular Ca2+ to support the refilling of ER stores is required for sustained Ca2+ oscillations, but the mechanisms underlying this Ca2+ influx are controversial. Although store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is an appealing candidate mechanism, several groups have arrived at contradictory conclusions regarding the importance of SOCE in oocytes and eggs. To definitively address this question, Ca2+ influx was assessed in oocytes and eggs lacking the major components of SOCE, the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM proteins, and the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel ORAI1. We generated oocyte-specific conditional knockout (cKO) mice for Stim1 and Stim2, and also generated Stim1/2 double cKO mice. Females lacking one or both STIM proteins were fertile and their ovulated eggs displayed normal patterns of Ca2+ oscillations following fertilization. In addition, no impairment was observed in ER Ca2+ stores or Ca2+ influx following store depletion. Similar studies were performed on eggs from mice globally lacking ORAI1; no abnormalities were observed. Furthermore, spontaneous Ca2+ influx was normal in oocytes from Stim1/2 cKO and ORAI1-null mice. Finally, we tested if TRPM7-like channels could support spontaneous Ca2+ influx, and found that it was largely prevented by NS8593, a TRPM7-specific inhibitor. Fertilization-induced Ca2+ oscillations were also impaired by NS8593. Combined, these data robustly show that SOCE is not required to support appropriate Ca2+ signaling in mouse oocytes and eggs, and that TRPM7-like channels may contribute to Ca2+ influx that was previously attributed to SOCE.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) is essential to the maintenance of telomere chromatin structure and integrity. However, how telomere integrity is maintained, especially in response to damage, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify Nek7, a member of the Never in Mitosis Gene A (NIMA) kinase family, as a regulator of telomere integrity. Nek7 is recruited to telomeres and stabilizes TRF1 at telomeres after damage in an ATM activation-dependent manner. Nek7 deficiency leads to telomere aberrations, long-lasting γH2AX and 53BP1 foci, and augmented cell death upon oxidative telomeric DNA damage. Mechanistically, Nek7 interacts with and phosphorylates TRF1 on Ser114, which prevents TRF1 from binding to Fbx4, an Skp1-Cul1-F box E3 ligase subunit, thereby alleviating proteasomal degradation of TRF1, leading to a stable association of TRF1 with Tin2 to form a shelterin complex. Our data reveal a mechanism of efficient protection of telomeres from damage through Nek7-dependent stabilization of TRF1.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that link environmental and intracellular stimuli to mitochondrial functions, including fission/fusion, ATP production, metabolite biogenesis, and apoptosis, are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the nutrient-sensing mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) stimulates translation of mitochondrial fission process 1 (MTFP1) to control mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. Expression of MTFP1 is coupled to pro-fission phosphorylation and mitochondrial recruitment of the fission GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). Potent active-site mTOR inhibitors engender mitochondrial hyperfusion due to the diminished translation of MTFP1, which is mediated by translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding proteins (4E-BPs). Uncoupling MTFP1 levels from the mTORC1/4E-BP pathway upon mTOR inhibition blocks the hyperfusion response and leads to apoptosis by converting mTOR inhibitor action from cytostatic to cytotoxic. These data provide direct evidence for cell survival upon mTOR inhibition through mitochondrial hyperfusion employing MTFP1 as a critical effector of mTORC1 to govern cell fate decisions.

Abstract: Summary
The protein 53BP1 plays a central regulatory role in DNA double-strand break repair. 53BP1 relocates to chromatin by recognizing RNF168-mediated mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A Lys15 in the nucleosome core particle dimethylated at histone H4 Lys20 (NCP-ubme). 53BP1 relocation is terminated by ubiquitin ligases RNF169 and RAD18 via unknown mechanisms. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and biochemistry, we show that RNF169 bridges ubiquitin and histone surfaces, stabilizing a pre-existing ubiquitin orientation in NCP-ubme to form a high-affinity complex. This conformational selection mechanism contrasts with the low-affinity binding mode of 53BP1, and it ensures 53BP1 displacement by RNF169 from NCP-ubme. We also show that RAD18 binds tightly to NCP-ubme through a ubiquitin-binding domain that contacts ubiquitin and nucleosome surfaces accessed by 53BP1. Our work uncovers diverse ubiquitin recognition mechanisms in the nucleosome, explaining how RNF168, RNF169, and RAD18 regulate 53BP1 chromatin recruitment and how specificity can be achieved in the recognition of a ubiquitin-modified substrate.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the pathways that lead to vasculogenic cells, and being able to identify their progenitors and lineage-restricted cells, is critical to the establishment of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) models for vascular diseases and development of vascular therapies. Here, we find that mesoderm-derived pericytes (PCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) originate from a clonal mesenchymal progenitor mesenchymoangioblast (MB). In clonogenic cultures, MBs differentiate into primitive PDGFRβ+CD271+CD73− mesenchymal progenitors, which give rise to proliferative PCs, SMCs, and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells. MB-derived PCs can be further specified to CD274+ capillary and DLK1+ arteriolar PCs with a proinflammatory and contractile phenotype, respectively. SMC maturation was induced using a MEK inhibitor. Establishing the vasculogenic lineage tree, along with identification of stage- and lineage-specific markers, provides a platform for interrogating the molecular mechanisms that regulate vasculogenic cell specification and diversification and manufacturing well-defined mural cell populations for vascular engineering and cellular therapies from hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Applications of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) require faithful chromatin changes during differentiation, but the fate of the X chromosome state in differentiating ESCs is unclear. Female human ESC lines either carry two active X chromosomes (XaXa), an Xa and inactive X chromosome with or without XIST RNA coating (XiXIST+Xa;XiXa), or an Xa and an eroded Xi (XeXa) where the Xi no longer expresses XIST RNA and has partially reactivated. Here, we established XiXa, XeXa, and XaXa ESC lines and followed their X chromosome state during differentiation. Surprisingly, we found that the X state pre-existing in primed ESCs is maintained in differentiated cells. Consequently, differentiated XeXa and XaXa cells lacked XIST, did not induce X inactivation, and displayed higher X-linked gene expression than XiXa cells. These results demonstrate that X chromosome dosage compensation is not required for ESC differentiation. Our data imply that XiXIST+Xa ESCs are most suited for downstream applications and show that all other X states are abnormal byproducts of our ESC derivation and propagation method.

Abstract: Summary
Dbf4-dependent kinases (DDKs) are required for the initiation of DNA replication, their essential targets being the MCM2-7 proteins. We show that, in Xenopus laevis egg extracts and human cells, hyper-phosphorylation of DNA-bound Mcm4, but not phosphorylation of Mcm2, correlates with DNA replication. These phosphorylations are differentially affected by the DDK inhibitors PHA-767491 and XL413. We show that DDK-dependent MCM phosphorylation is reversed by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) targeted to chromatin by Rif1. Loss of Rif1 increased MCM phosphorylation and the rate of replication initiation and also compromised the ability of cells to block initiation when challenged with replication inhibitors. We also provide evidence that Rif1 can mediate MCM dephosphorylation at replication forks and that the stability of dephosphorylated replisomes strongly depends on Chk1 activity. We propose that both replication initiation and replisome stability depend on MCM phosphorylation, which is maintained by a balance of DDK-dependent phosphorylation and Rif1-mediated dephosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Combinatorial control of gene expression is presumed to be mediated by molecular interactions between coincident transcription factors (TFs). While information on the genome-wide locations of TFs is available, the genes they regulate and whether they function combinatorially often remain open questions. Here, we developed a mechanistic, rather than statistical, modeling approach to elucidate TF control logic from gene expression data. Applying this approach to hundreds of genes in 85 datasets measuring the transcriptional responses of murine fibroblasts and macrophages to cytokines and pathogens, we found that stimulus-responsive TFs generally function sequentially in logical OR gates or singly. Logical AND gates were found between NF-κB-responsive mRNA synthesis and MAPKp38-responsive control of mRNA half-life, but not between temporally coincident TFs. Our analyses identified the functional target genes of each of the pathogen-responsive TFs and prompt a revision of the conceptual underpinnings of combinatorial control of gene expression to include sequentially acting molecular mechanisms that govern mRNA synthesis and decay.

Abstract: Summary
Immune cells are equipped with a number of receptors that recognize sterile injury and pathogens. We find that host immune cells release ATP as an inflammatory signal in response to allogeneic transplantation. ATP then acts via a feedback mechanism on the P2X7 channel to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequently process and release interleukin (IL)-18. This process is a necessary stage in the deleterious Th1 response against allotransplantation via interferon-γ production. Lack of IL-18 resulted in a decrease in graft-infiltrating CD8 cells but an increase in regulatory T cells. In human liver transplant patients undergoing progressive immunosuppressive drug withdrawal, we found that patients experiencing acute rejection had higher levels of the P2X7 receptor in circulating inflammatory monocytes compared to tolerant patients. These data suggest that the pharmacological inhibition of the P2X7 receptor or the NLRP3 inflammasome will aid in inducing transplant tolerance without complete immunoparalysis.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia (pain hypersensitivity) are cardinal signs of inflammation. Although the mechanism underlying thermal hyperalgesia is well understood, the cellular and molecular basis of mechanical hyperalgesia is poorly described. Here, we have identified a subset of peptidergic C-fiber nociceptors that are insensitive to noxious mechanical stimuli under normal conditions but become sensitized to such stimuli when exposed to the inflammatory mediator nerve growth factor (NGF). Strikingly, NGF did not affect mechanosensitivity of other nociceptors. We show that these mechanoinsensitive “silent” nociceptors are characterized by the expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3 (CHRNA3) and that the mechanically gated ion channel PIEZO2 mediates NGF-induced mechanosensitivity in these neurons. Retrograde tracing revealed that CHRNA3+ nociceptors account for ∼50% of all peptidergic nociceptive afferents innervating visceral organs and deep somatic tissues. Hence, our data suggest that NGF-induced “un-silencing” of CHRNA3+ nociceptors significantly contributes to the development of mechanical hyperalgesia during inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Organogenesis during embryonic development occurs through the differentiation of progenitor cells. This process is extraordinarily accurate, but the mechanisms ensuring high fidelity are poorly understood. Coronary vessels of the mouse heart derive from at least two progenitor pools, the sinus venosus and endocardium. We find that the ELABELA (ELA)-APJ signaling axis is only required for sinus venosus-derived progenitors. Because they do not depend on ELA-APJ, endocardial progenitors are able to expand and compensate for faulty sinus venosus development in Apj mutants, leading to normal adult heart function. An upregulation of endocardial SOX17 accompanied compensation in Apj mutants, which was also seen in Ccbe1 knockouts, indicating that the endocardium is activated in multiple cases where sinus venosus angiogenesis is stunted. Our data demonstrate that by diversifying their responsivity to growth cues, distinct coronary progenitor pools are able to compensate for each other during coronary development, thereby providing robustness to organ development.

Abstract: Summary
Although the widely used anticoagulant drug heparin has been shown to have many other biological functions independent of its anticoagulant role, its effects on energy homeostasis are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that heparin level is negatively associated with nutritional states and that heparin treatment increases food intake and body weight gain. By using electrophysiological, pharmacological, molecular biological, and chemogenetic approaches, we provide evidence that heparin increases food intake by stimulating AgRP neurons and increasing AgRP release. Our results support a model whereby heparin competes with insulin for insulin receptor binding on AgRP neurons, and by doing so it inhibits FoxO1 activity to promote AgRP release and feeding. Heparin may be a potential drug target for food intake regulation and body weight control.

Breast cancer stem cells (bCSCs) have been implicated in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance; however, the molecular mechanisms that define this state are unclear. We have performed two microRNA (miRNA) gain- and loss-of-function screens to identify miRNAs that regulate the choice between bCSC self-renewal and differentiation. We find that micro-RNA (miR)-600 silencing results in bCSC expansion, while its overexpression reduces bCSC self-renewal, leading to decreased in vivo tumorigenicity. miR-600 targets stearoyl desaturase 1 (SCD1), an enzyme required to produce active, lipid-modified WNT proteins. In the absence of miR-600, WNT signaling is active and promotes self-renewal, whereas overexpression of miR-600 inhibits the production of active WNT and promotes bCSC differentiation. In a series of 120 breast tumors, we found that a low level of miR-600 is correlated with active WNT signaling and a poor prognosis. These findings highlight a miR-600-centered signaling network that governs bCSC-fate decisions and influences tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
How metabolism is rewired during embryonic development is still largely unknown, as it remains a major technical challenge to resolve metabolic activities or metabolite levels with spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we investigated metabolic changes during development of organogenesis-stage mouse embryos, focusing on the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). We measured glycolytic labeling kinetics from 13C-glucose tracing experiments and detected elevated glycolysis in the posterior, more undifferentiated PSM. We found evidence that the spatial metabolic differences are functionally relevant during PSM development. To enable real-time quantification of a glycolytic metabolite with spatiotemporal resolution, we generated a pyruvate FRET-sensor reporter mouse line. We revealed dynamic changes in cytosolic pyruvate levels as cells transit toward a more anterior PSM state. Combined, our approach identifies a gradient of glycolytic activity across the PSM, and we provide evidence that these spatiotemporal metabolic changes are intrinsically linked to PSM development and differentiation.

Abstract: Neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN), discovered in mice brain cell nuclei by Mullen et al. (1992), is used as an excellent marker of post-mitotic neurons in vertebrates. In this study, the expression pattern of NeuN was examined in the Xenopus brain to explore phylogenetic differences in NeuN expression. Anti-NeuN antibody showed selective staining in mouse and Xenopus brain extracts, but the number and molecular weight of the bands differed in Western blotting analysis. In immunostaining, anti-NeuN antibody showed selective staining of neurons, but not glial cells, in the Xenopus brain. Most neurons, including olfactory bulb mitral cells and cerebellar Purkinjie cells, which show no immunoreactivity in birds/mammals, showed NeuN immunoreactivity in Xenopus. This study revealed that anti-NeuN antibody is a useful marker of post-mitotic neurons in amphibians, but it also stains neurons that show no reactivity in more derived animals.

Abstract: Summary
The glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) family kinases are central cellular regulators highly conserved in all eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, the GSK3-like kinase BIN2 phosphorylates a range of proteins to control broad developmental processes, and BIN2 is degraded through unknown mechanism upon receptor kinase-mediated brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Here we identify KIB1 as an F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes the degradation of BIN2 while blocking its substrate access. Loss-of-function mutations of KIB1 and its homologs abolished BR-induced BIN2 degradation and caused severe BR-insensitive phenotypes. KIB1 directly interacted with BIN2 in a BR-dependent manner and promoted BIN2 ubiquitination in vitro. Expression of an F-box-truncated KIB1 caused BIN2 accumulation but dephosphorylation of its substrate BZR1 and activation of BR responses because KIB1 blocked BIN2 binding to BZR1. Our study demonstrates that KIB1 plays an essential role in BR signaling by inhibiting BIN2 through dual mechanisms of blocking substrate access and promoting degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Most tumor cells exhibit obligatory demands for essential amino acids (EAAs), but the regulatory mechanisms whereby tumor cells take up EAAs and EAAs promote malignant transformation remain to be determined. Here, we show that oncogenic MYC, solute carrier family (SLC) 7 member 5 (SLC7A5), and SLC43A1 constitute a feedforward activation loop to promote EAA transport and tumorigenesis. MYC selectively activates Slc7a5 and Slc43a1 transcription through direct binding to specific E box elements within both genes, enabling effective EAA import. Elevated EAAs, in turn, stimulate Myc mRNA translation, in part through attenuation of the GCN2-eIF2α-ATF4 amino acid stress response pathway, leading to MYC-dependent transcriptional amplification. SLC7A5/SLC43A1 depletion inhibits MYC expression, metabolic reprogramming, and tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings thus reveal a MYC-SLC7A5/SLC43A1 signaling circuit that underlies EAA metabolism, MYC deregulation, and tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Basal p53 levels are tightly suppressed under normal conditions. Disrupting this regulation results in elevated p53 levels to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and tumor suppression. Here, we report the suppression of basal p53 levels by a nuclear, p53-regulated long noncoding RNA that we termed PURPL (p53 upregulated regulator of p53 levels). Targeted depletion of PURPL in colorectal cancer cells results in elevated basal p53 levels and induces growth defects in cell culture and in mouse xenografts. PURPL associates with MYBBP1A, a protein that binds to and stabilizes p53, and inhibits the formation of the p53-MYBBP1A complex. In the absence of PURPL, MYBBP1A interacts with and stabilizes p53. Silencing MYBBP1A significantly rescues basal p53 levels and proliferation in PURPL-deficient cells, suggesting that MYBBP1A mediates the effect of PURPL in regulating p53. These results reveal a p53-PURPL auto-regulatory feedback loop and demonstrate a role for PURPL in maintaining basal p53 levels.

Abstract: Summary
The degree of genetic aberrations characteristic of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) makes identification of the molecular features that drive tumor progression difficult. Here, we perform genome-wide RNAi screens and comprehensive expression analysis of cell-surface markers in a panel of HGSC cell lines to identify genes that are critical to their survival. We report that the tetraspanin CD151 contributes to survival of a subset of HGSC cell lines associated with a ZEB transcriptional program and supports the growth of HGSC tumors. Moreover, we show that high CD151 expression is prognostic of poor clinical outcome. This study reveals cell-surface vulnerabilities associated with HGSC, provides a framework for identifying therapeutic targets, and reports a role for CD151 in HGSC.

Abstract: Summary
Cilia are organelles specialized for movement and signaling. To infer when during evolution signaling pathways became associated with cilia, we characterized the proteomes of cilia from sea urchins, sea anemones, and choanoflagellates. We identified 437 high-confidence ciliary candidate proteins conserved in mammals and discovered that Hedgehog and G-protein-coupled receptor pathways were linked to cilia before the origin of bilateria and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels before the origin of animals. We demonstrated that candidates not previously implicated in ciliary biology localized to cilia and further investigated ENKUR, a TRP channel-interacting protein identified in the cilia of all three organisms. ENKUR localizes to motile cilia and is required for patterning the left-right axis in vertebrates. Moreover, mutation of ENKUR causes situs inversus in humans. Thus, proteomic profiling of cilia from diverse eukaryotes defines a conserved ciliary proteome, reveals ancient connections to signaling, and uncovers a ciliary protein that underlies development and human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cell (ESC) abnormalities in genome methylation hamper the utility of their therapeutic derivatives; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase, Sirt1, selectively prevents abnormal DNA methylation of some developmental genes in murine ESCs by antagonizing Dnmt3l. Transcriptome and DNA methylome analyses demonstrated that Sirt1-null (Sirt1−/−) ESCs repress expression of a subset of imprinted and germline genes concomitant with increased DNA methylation of regulatory elements. Dnmt3l was highly expressed in Sirt1−/− ESCs, and knockdown partially rescued abnormal DNA methylation of the Sirt1 target genes. The Sirt1 protein suppressed transcription of Dnmt3l and physically interacted with the Dnmt3l protein, deacetylating and destabilizing Dnmt3l protein. Sirt1 deficiency delayed neurogenesis and spermatogenesis. These differentiation delays were significantly or partially abolished by reintroduction of Sirt1 cDNA or Dnmt3l knockdown. This study sheds light on mechanisms that restrain DNA methylation of developmentally vital genes operating in ESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that target HIV-1 envelope (Env) is a goal of HIV-1 vaccine development. A bnAb target is the Env third variable loop (V3)-glycan site. To determine whether immunization could induce antibodies to the V3-glycan bnAb binding site, we repetitively immunized macaques over a 4-year period with an Env expressing V3-high mannose glycans. Env immunizations elicited plasma antibodies that neutralized HIV-1 expressing only high-mannose glycans—a characteristic shared by early bnAb B cell lineage members. A rhesus recombinant monoclonal antibody from a vaccinated macaque bound to the V3-glycan site at the same amino acids as broadly neutralizing antibodies. A structure of the antibody bound to glycan revealed that the three variable heavy-chain complementarity-determining regions formed a cavity into which glycan could insert and neutralized multiple HIV-1 isolates with high-mannose glycans. Thus, HIV-1 Env vaccination induced mannose-dependent antibodies with characteristics of V3-glycan bnAb precursors.

Abstract: Summary
The unfolded protein response (UPR), induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, regulates the expression of factors that restore protein folding homeostasis. However, in the liver and kidney, ER stress also leads to lipid accumulation, accompanied at least in the liver by transcriptional suppression of metabolic genes. The mechanisms of this accumulation, including which pathways contribute to the phenotype in each organ, are unclear. We combined gene expression profiling, biochemical assays, and untargeted lipidomics to understand the basis of stress-dependent lipid accumulation, taking advantage of enhanced hepatic and renal steatosis in mice lacking the ER stress sensor ATF6α. We found that impaired fatty acid oxidation contributed to the early development of steatosis in the liver but not the kidney, while anorexia-induced lipolysis promoted late triglyceride and free fatty acid accumulation in both organs. These findings provide evidence for both direct and indirect regulation of peripheral metabolism by ER stress.

Abstract: Summary
The hexameric AAA+ ATPases Rvb1 and Rvb2 (Rvbs) are essential for diverse processes ranging from metabolic signaling to chromatin remodeling, but their functions are unknown. While originally thought to act as helicases, recent proposals suggest that Rvbs act as protein assembly chaperones. However, experimental evidence for chaperone-like behavior is lacking. Here, we identify a potent protein activator of the Rvbs, a domain in the Ino80 ATPase subunit of the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex, termed Ino80INS. Ino80INS stimulates Rvbs’ ATPase activity by 16-fold while concomitantly promoting their dodecamerization. Using mass spectrometry, cryo-EM, and integrative modeling, we find that Ino80INS binds asymmetrically along the dodecamerization interface, resulting in a conformationally flexible dodecamer that collapses into hexamers upon ATP addition. Our results demonstrate the chaperone-like potential of Rvb1/Rvb2 and suggest a model where binding of multiple clients such as Ino80 stimulates ATP-driven cycling between hexamers and dodecamers, providing iterative opportunities for correct subunit assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Defining the genes that are essential for cellular proliferation is critical for understanding organismal development and identifying high-value targets for disease therapies. However, the requirements for cell-cycle progression in human cells remain incompletely understood. To elucidate the consequences of acute and chronic elimination of cell-cycle proteins, we generated and characterized inducible CRISPR/Cas9 knockout human cell lines targeting 209 genes involved in diverse cell-cycle processes. We performed single-cell microscopic analyses to systematically establish the effects of the knockouts on subcellular architecture. To define variations in cell-cycle requirements between cultured cell lines, we generated knockouts across cell lines of diverse origins. We demonstrate that p53 modulates the phenotype of specific cell-cycle defects through distinct mechanisms, depending on the defect. This work provides a resource to broadly facilitate robust and long-term depletion of cell-cycle proteins and reveals insights into the requirements for cell-cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
The presence of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most important predictor of liver mortality. There are limited data on the diagnostic accuracy of gut microbiota-derived signature for predicting the presence of advanced fibrosis. In this prospective study, we characterized the gut microbiome compositions using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of DNA extracted from stool samples. This study included 86 uniquely well-characterized patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, of which 72 had mild/moderate (stage 0–2 fibrosis) NAFLD, and 14 had advanced fibrosis (stage 3 or 4 fibrosis). We identified a set of 40 features (p < 0.006), which included 37 bacterial species that were used to construct a Random Forest classifier model to distinguish mild/moderate NAFLD from advanced fibrosis. The model had a robust diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.936) for detecting advanced fibrosis. This study provides preliminary evidence for a fecal-microbiome-derived metagenomic signature to detect advanced fibrosis in NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
Cells convert excess energy into neutral lipids that are made in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bilayer. The lipids are then packaged into spherical or budded lipid droplets (LDs) covered by a phospholipid monolayer containing proteins. LDs play a key role in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis. A key unanswered question in the life of LDs is how they bud off from the ER. Here, we tackle this question by studying the budding of artificial LDs from model membranes. We find that the bilayer phospholipid composition and surface tension are key parameters of LD budding. Phospholipids have differential LD budding aptitudes, and those inducing budding decrease the bilayer tension. We observe that decreasing tension favors the egress of neutral lipids from the bilayer and LD budding. In cells, budding conditions favor the formation of small LDs. Our discovery reveals the importance of altering ER physical chemistry for controlled cellular LD formation.
