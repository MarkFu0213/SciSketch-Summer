Abstract: Summary
Energy-dense food alters dopaminergic (DA) transmission in the mesocorticolimbic (MCL) system and can promote reward dysfunctions, compulsive feeding, and weight gain. Yet the mechanisms by which nutrients influence the MCL circuitry remain elusive. Here, we show that nutritional triglycerides (TGs), a conserved post-prandial metabolic signature among mammals, can be metabolized within the MCL system and modulate DA-associated behaviors by gating the activity of dopamine receptor subtype 2 (DRD2)-expressing neurons through a mechanism that involves the action of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Further, we show that in humans, post-prandial TG excursions modulate brain responses to food cues in individuals carrying a genetic risk for reduced DRD2 signaling. Collectively, these findings unveil a novel mechanism by which dietary TGs directly alter signaling in the reward circuit to regulate behavior, thereby providing a new mechanistic basis by which energy-rich diets may lead to (mal)adaptations in DA signaling that underlie reward deficit and compulsive behavior.

Abstract: Summary
NADH provides electrons for aerobic ATP production. In cells deprived of oxygen or with impaired electron transport chain activity, NADH accumulation can be toxic. To minimize such toxicity, elevated NADH inhibits the classical NADH-producing pathways: glucose, glutamine, and fat oxidation. Here, through deuterium-tracing studies in cultured cells and mice, we show that folate-dependent serine catabolism also produces substantial NADH. Strikingly, when respiration is impaired, serine catabolism through methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD2) becomes a major NADH source. In cells whose respiration is slowed by hypoxia, metformin, or genetic lesions, mitochondrial serine catabolism inhibition partially normalizes NADH levels and facilitates cell growth. In mice with engineered mitochondrial complex I deficiency (NDUSF4−/−), serine’s contribution to NADH is elevated, and progression of spasticity is modestly slowed by pharmacological blockade of serine degradation. Thus, when respiration is impaired, serine catabolism contributes to toxic NADH accumulation.

Abstract: Summary
G3BP RNA-binding proteins are important components of stress granules (SGs). Here, we analyze the role of the Drosophila G3BP Rasputin (RIN) in unstressed cells, where RIN is not SG associated. Immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis identifies over 550 mRNAs that copurify with RIN. The mRNAs found in SGs are long and translationally silent. In contrast, we find that RIN-bound mRNAs, which encode core components of the transcription, splicing, and translation machinery, are short, stable, and highly translated. We show that RIN is associated with polysomes and provide evidence for a direct role for RIN and its human homologs in stabilizing and upregulating the translation of their target mRNAs. We propose that when cells are stressed, the resulting incorporation of RIN/G3BPs into SGs sequesters them away from their short target mRNAs. This would downregulate the expression of these transcripts, even though they are not incorporated into stress granules.

Abstract: Summary
To study the development of the human retina, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at key fetal stages and follow the development of the major cell types as well as populations of transitional cells. We also analyze stem cell (hPSC)-derived retinal organoids; although organoids have a very similar cellular composition at equivalent ages as the fetal retina, there are some differences in gene expression of particular cell types. Moreover, the inner retinal lamination is disrupted at more advanced stages of organoids compared with fetal retina. To determine whether the disorganization in the inner retina is due to the culture conditions, we analyze retinal development in fetal retina maintained under similar conditions. These retinospheres develop for at least 6 months, displaying better inner retinal lamination than retinal organoids. Our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) comparisons of fetal retina, retinal organoids, and retinospheres provide a resource for developing better in vitro models for retinal disease.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death driven by the iron-dependent accumulation of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids. There is no reliable way to selectively stain ferroptotic cells in tissue sections to characterize the extent of ferroptosis in animal models or patient samples. We address this gap by immunizing mice with membranes from lymphoma cells treated with the ferroptosis inducer piperazine erastin and screening ∼4,750 of the resulting monoclonal antibodies generated for their ability to selectively detect cells undergoing ferroptosis. We find that one antibody, 3F3 ferroptotic membrane antibody (3F3-FMA), is effective as a selective ferroptosis-staining reagent. The antigen of 3F3-FMA is identified as the human transferrin receptor 1 protein (TfR1). We validate this finding with several additional anti-TfR1 antibodies and compare them to other potential ferroptosis-detecting reagents. We find that anti-TfR1 and anti-malondialdehyde adduct antibodies are effective at staining ferroptotic tumor cells in multiple cell culture and tissue contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional mechanisms that drive angiogenesis and organotypic vascular endothelial cell specialization are poorly understood. Here, we show that retinal endothelial sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs), which restrain vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis, spatially restrict expression of JunB, a member of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors (TFs). Mechanistically, VEGF induces JunB expression at the sprouting vascular front while S1PR-dependent vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin assembly suppresses JunB expression in the nascent vascular network, thus creating a gradient of this TF. Endothelial-specific JunB knockout mice showed diminished expression of neurovascular guidance genes and attenuated retinal vascular network progression. In addition, endothelial S1PR signaling is required for normal expression of β-catenin-dependent genes such as TCF/LEF1 and ZIC3 TFs, transporters, and junctional proteins. These results show that S1PR signaling restricts JunB function to the expanding vascular front, thus creating an AP-1 gradient and enabling organotypic endothelial cell specialization of the vascular network.

Abstract: Summary
AMPK is a central regulator of metabolism and autophagy. Here we show how lysosomal damage activates AMPK. This occurs via a hitherto unrecognized signal transduction system whereby cytoplasmic sentinel lectins detect membrane damage leading to ubiquitination responses. Absence of Galectin 9 (Gal9) or loss of its capacity to recognize lumenal glycans exposed during lysosomal membrane damage abrogate such ubiquitination responses. Proteomic analyses with APEX2-Gal9 have revealed global changes within the Gal9 interactome during lysosomal damage. Gal9 association with lysosomal glycoproteins increases whereas interactions with a newly identified Gal9 partner, deubiquitinase USP9X, diminishes upon lysosomal injury. In response to damage, Gal9 displaces USP9X from complexes with TAK1 and promotes K63 ubiquitination of TAK1 thus activating AMPK on damaged lysosomes. This triggers autophagy and contributes to autophagic control of membrane-damaging microbe Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus, galectin and ubiquitin systems converge to activate AMPK and autophagy during endomembrane homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
How chromosome organization is related to genome function remains poorly understood. Cohesin, loop extrusion, and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) have been proposed to create topologically associating domains (TADs) to regulate gene expression. Here, we examine chromosome conformation in embryonic stem cells lacking cohesin and find, as in other cell types, that cohesin is required to create TADs and regulate A/B compartmentalization. However, in the absence of cohesin, we identify a series of long-range chromosomal interactions that persist. These correspond to regions of the genome occupied by the polycomb repressive system and are dependent on PRC1. Importantly, we discover that cohesin counteracts these polycomb-dependent interactions, but not interactions between super-enhancers. This disruptive activity is independent of CTCF and insulation and appears to modulate gene repression by the polycomb system. Therefore, we discover that cohesin disrupts polycomb-dependent chromosome interactions to modulate gene expression in embryonic stem cells.

Abstract: SmTAL1 is a calcium binding protein from the parasitic worm, Schistosoma mansoni. Structurally it is comprised of two domains – an N-terminal EF-hand domain and a C-terminal dynein light chain (DLC)-like domain. The protein has previously been shown to interact with the anti-schistosomal drug, praziquantel (PZQ). Here, we demonstrated that both EF-hands in the N-terminal domain are functional calcium ion binding sites. The second EF-hand appears to be more important in dictating affinity and mediating the conformational changes which occur on calcium ion binding. There is positive cooperativity between the four calcium ion binding sites in the dimeric form of SmTAL1. Both the EF-hand domain and the DLC-domain dimerise independently suggesting that both play a role in forming the SmTAL1 dimer. SmTAL1 binds non-cooperatively to PZQ and cooperatively to an IQ-motif from SmCav1B, a voltage-gated calcium channel. PZQ tends to strengthen this interaction, although the relationship is complex. These data suggest the hypothesis that SmTAL1 regulates at least one voltage-gated calcium channel and PZQ interferes with this process. This may be important in the molecular mechanism of this drug. It also suggests that compounds which bind SmTAL1, such as six from the Medicines for Malaria Box identified in this work, may represent possible leads for the discovery of novel antagonists.

Abstract: Summary
As cells enter mitosis, the genome is restructured to facilitate chromosome segregation, accompanied by dramatic changes in gene expression. However, the mechanisms that underlie mitotic transcriptional regulation are unclear. In contrast to transcribed genes, centromere regions retain transcriptionally active RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in mitosis. Here, we demonstrate that chromatin-bound cohesin is necessary to retain elongating Pol II at centromeres. We find that WAPL-mediated removal of cohesin from chromosome arms during prophase is required for the dissociation of Pol II and nascent transcripts, and failure of this process dramatically alters mitotic gene expression. Removal of cohesin/Pol II from chromosome arms in prophase is important for accurate chromosome segregation and normal activation of gene expression in G1. We propose that prophase cohesin removal is a key step in reprogramming gene expression as cells transition from G2 through mitosis to G1.

Abstract: Summary
How satellite cells and their progenitors balance differentiation and self-renewal to achieve sustainable tissue regeneration is not well understood. A major roadblock to understanding satellite cell fate decisions has been the difficulty of studying this process in vivo. By visualizing expression dynamics of myogenic transcription factors during early regeneration in vivo, we identify the time point at which cells undergo decisions to differentiate or self-renew. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals heterogeneity of satellite cells, including a subpopulation enriched in Notch2 receptor expression, during both muscle homeostasis and regeneration. Furthermore, we reveal that differentiating cells express the Dll1 ligand. Using antagonistic antibodies, we demonstrate that the DLL1 and NOTCH2 signaling pair is required for satellite cell self-renewal. Thus, differentiating cells provide the self-renewing signal during regeneration, enabling proportional regeneration in response to injury while maintaining the satellite cell pool. These findings have implications for therapeutic control of muscle regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Layer 6b (L6b), the deepest neocortical layer, projects to cortical targets and higher-order thalamus and is the only layer responsive to the wake-promoting neuropeptide orexin/hypocretin. These characteristics suggest that L6b can strongly modulate brain state, but projections to L6b and their influence remain unknown. Here, we examine the inputs to L6b ex vivo in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex with rabies-based retrograde tracing and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping in brain slices. We find that L6b receives its strongest excitatory input from intracortical long-range projection neurons, including those in the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast, local intracortical input and thalamocortical input were significantly weaker. Moreover, our data suggest that L6b receives far less thalamocortical input than other cortical layers. L6b was most strongly inhibited by PV and SST interneurons. This study shows that L6b integrates long-range intracortical information and is not part of the traditional thalamocortical loop.

Abstract: Summary
Memory B cells (MBCs) epitomize the adaptation of the immune system to the environment. We identify two MBC subsets in peripheral blood, CD27dull and CD27bright MBCs, whose frequency changes with age. Heavy chain variable region (VH) usage, somatic mutation frequency replacement-to-silent ratio, and CDR3 property changes, reflecting consecutive selection of highly antigen-specific, low cross-reactive antibody variants, all demonstrate that CD27dull and CD27bright MBCs represent sequential MBC developmental stages, and stringent antigen-driven pressure selects CD27dull into the CD27bright MBC pool. Dynamics of human MBCs are exploited in pregnancy, when 50% of maternal MBCs are lost and CD27dull MBCs transit to the more differentiated CD27bright stage. In the postpartum period, the maternal MBC pool is replenished by the expansion of persistent CD27dull clones. Thus, the stability and flexibility of human B cell memory is ensured by CD27dull MBCs that expand and differentiate in response to change.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic variations in TMEM106B, coding for a lysosomal membrane protein, affect frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) in GRN- (coding for progranulin) and C9orf72-expansion carriers and might play a role in aging. To determine the physiological function of TMEM106B, we generated TMEM106B-deficient mice. These mice develop proximal axonal swellings caused by drastically enlarged LAMP1-positive vacuoles, increased retrograde axonal transport of lysosomes, and accumulation of lipofuscin and autophagosomes. Giant vacuoles specifically accumulate at the distal end and within the axon initial segment, but not in peripheral nerves or at axon terminals, resulting in an impaired facial-nerve-dependent motor performance. These data implicate TMEM106B in mediating the axonal transport of LAMP1-positive organelles in motoneurons and axonal sorting at the initial segment. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how TMEM106B affects lysosomal proteolysis and degradative capacity in neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Synapses are fundamental to the normal function of the nervous system. Glia play a pivotal role in regulating synaptic formation. However, how presynaptic neurons assemble synaptic structure in response to the glial signals remains largely unexplored. To address this question, we use cima-1 mutant C. elegans as an in vivo model, in which the astrocyte-like VCSC glial processes ectopically reach an asynaptic neurite region and promote presynaptic formation there. Through an RNAi screen, we find that the Rho GTPase CDC-42 and IQGAP PES-7 are required in presynaptic neurons for VCSC glia-induced presynaptic formation. In addition, we find that cdc-42 and pes-7 are also required for normal synaptogenesis during postembryonic developmental stages. PES-7 activated by CDC-42 promotes presynaptic formation, most likely through regulating F-actin assembly. Given the evolutionary conservation of CDC-42 and IQGAPs, we speculate that our findings in C. elegans apply to vertebrates.

Abstract: Summary
Premature loss of sister chromatid cohesion at metaphase is a diagnostic marker for different cohesinopathies. Here, we report that metaphase spreads of many cancer cell lines also show premature loss of sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesion loss occurs independently of mutations in cohesion factors including SA2, a cohesin subunit frequently inactivated in cancer. In untransformed cells, induction of DNA replication stress by activation of oncogenes or inhibition of DNA replication is sufficient to trigger sister chromatid cohesion loss. Importantly, cell growth under conditions of replication stress requires the cohesin remover WAPL. WAPL promotes rapid RAD51-dependent repair and restart of broken replication forks. We propose that active removal of cohesin allows cancer cells to overcome DNA replication stress. This leads to oncogene-induced cohesion loss from newly synthesized sister chromatids that may contribute to genomic instability and likely represents a targetable cancer cell vulnerability.

Abstract: Summary
For decades, two fusion modes were thought to control hormone and transmitter release essential to life; one facilitates release via fusion pore dilation and flattening (full collapse), and the other limits release by closing a narrow fusion pore (kiss-and-run). Using super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to visualize fusion modes of dense-core vesicles in neuroendocrine cells, we find that facilitation of release is mediated not by full collapse but by shrink fusion, in which the Ω-profile generated by vesicle fusion shrinks but maintains a large non-dilating pore. We discover that the physiological osmotic pressure of a cell squeezes, but does not dilate, the Ω-profile, which explains why shrink fusion prevails over full collapse. Instead of kiss-and-run, enlarge fusion, in which Ω-profiles grow while maintaining a narrow pore, slows down release. Shrink and enlarge fusion may thus account for diverse hormone and transmitter release kinetics observed in secretory cells, previously interpreted within the full-collapse/kiss-and-run framework.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are sequentially processed by two RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer. miR-451 is the only known miRNA whose processing bypasses Dicer and instead relies on the slicer activity of Argonaute-2 (Ago2). miR-451 is highly conserved in vertebrates and regulates erythrocyte maturation, where it becomes the most abundant miRNA. However, the basis for the non-canonical biogenesis of miR-451 is unclear. Here, we show that Ago2 is less efficient than Dicer in processing pre-miRNAs, but this deficit is overcome when miR-144 represses Dicer in a negative-feedback loop during erythropoiesis. Loss of miR-144-mediated Dicer repression in zebrafish embryos and human cells leads to increased canonical miRNA production and impaired miR-451 maturation. Overexpression of Ago2 rescues some of the defects of miR-451 processing. Thus, the evolution of Ago2-dependent processing allows miR-451 to circumvent the global repression of canonical miRNAs elicited, in part, by the miR-144 targeting of Dicer during erythropoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes organize chromosomes ubiquitously, thereby contributing to their faithful segregation. We demonstrate that under conditions of increased chromosome occupancy of the Escherichia coli SMC complex, MukBEF, the chromosome is organized as a series of loops around a thin (<130 nm) MukBEF axial core, whose length is ∼1,100 times shorter than the chromosomal DNA. The linear order of chromosomal loci is maintained in the axial cores, whose formation requires MukBEF ATP hydrolysis. Axial core structure in non-replicating chromosomes is predominantly linear (1 μm) but becomes circular (1.5 μm) in the absence of MatP because of its failure to displace MukBEF from the 800 kbp replication termination region (ter). Displacement of MukBEF from ter by MatP in wild-type cells directs MukBEF colocalization with the replication origin. We conclude that MukBEF individualizes and compacts the chromosome lengthwise, demonstrating a chromosome organization mechanism similar to condensin in mitotic chromosome formation.

Abstract: Insects detect volatile chemosignals with olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that express olfactory receptors. Among them, the most sensitive receptors are the odorant receptors (ORs), which form cation channels passing also Ca2+. Here, we investigate if and how odor-induced Ca2+ signals in Drosophila melanogaster OSNs are controlled by intracellular Ca2+ stores, especially by mitochondria. Using an open antenna preparation that allows observation and pharmacological manipulation of OSNs we performed Ca2+ imaging to determine the role of Ca2+ influx and efflux pathways in OSN mitochondria. The results indicate that mitochondria participate in shaping the OR responses. The major players of this modulation are the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Intriguingly, OR-induced Ca2+ signals were only mildly affected by modulating the Ca2+ management of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Abstract: Summary
TRAF-interacting protein with a forkhead-associated domain B (TIFAB) is implicated in myeloid malignancies with deletion of chromosome 5q. Employing a combination of proteomic and genetic approaches, we find that TIFAB regulates ubiquitin-specific peptidase 15 (USP15) ubiquitin hydrolase activity. Expression of TIFAB in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) permits USP15 signaling to substrates, including MDM2 and KEAP1, and mitigates p53 expression. Consequently, TIFAB-deficient HSPCs exhibit compromised USP15 signaling and are sensitized to hematopoietic stress by derepression of p53. In MLL-AF9 leukemia, deletion of TIFAB increases p53 signaling and correspondingly decreases leukemic cell function and development of leukemia. Restoring USP15 expression partially rescues the function of TIFAB-deficient MLL-AF9 cells. Conversely, elevated TIFAB represses p53, increases leukemic progenitor function, and correlates with MLL gene expression programs in leukemia patients. Our studies uncover a function of TIFAB as an effector of USP15 activity and rheostat of p53 signaling in stressed and malignant HSPCs.

Abstract: Summary
Genome editing technologies have transformed our ability to engineer desired genomic changes within living systems. However, detecting precise genomic modifications often requires sophisticated, expensive, and time-consuming experimental approaches. Here, we describe DTECT (Dinucleotide signaTurE CapTure), a rapid and versatile detection method that relies on the capture of targeted dinucleotide signatures resulting from the digestion of genomic DNA amplicons by the type IIS restriction enzyme AcuI. DTECT enables the accurate quantification of marker-free precision genome editing events introduced by CRISPR-dependent homology-directed repair, base editing, or prime editing in various biological systems, such as mammalian cell lines, organoids, and tissues. Furthermore, DTECT allows the identification of oncogenic mutations in cancer mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and human cancer patient samples. The ease, speed, and cost efficiency by which DTECT identifies genomic signatures should facilitate the generation of marker-free cellular and animal models of human disease and expedite the detection of human pathogenic variants.

Abstract: Summary
Secondary bacterial infections often complicate viral respiratory infections. We hypothesize that perturbation of the gut microbiota during influenza A virus (IAV) infection might favor respiratory bacterial superinfection. Sublethal infection with influenza transiently alters the composition and fermentative activity of the gut microbiota in mice. These changes are attributed in part to reduced food consumption. Fecal transfer experiments demonstrate that the IAV-conditioned microbiota compromises lung defenses against pneumococcal infection. In mechanistic terms, reduced production of the predominant short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) acetate affects the bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages. Following treatment with acetate, mice colonized with the IAV-conditioned microbiota display reduced bacterial loads. In the context of influenza infection, acetate supplementation reduces, in a free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2)-dependent manner, local and systemic bacterial loads. This translates into reduced lung pathology and improved survival rates of double-infected mice. Lastly, pharmacological activation of the SCFA receptor FFAR2 during influenza reduces bacterial superinfection.

Abstract: Summary
Acute cardiac hypoxia produces life-threatening elevations in late sodium current (ILATE) in the human heart. Here, we show the underlying mechanism: hypoxia induces rapid SUMOylation of NaV1.5 channels so they reopen when normally inactive, late in the action potential. NaV1.5 is SUMOylated only on lysine 442, and the mutation of that residue, or application of a deSUMOylating enzyme, prevents hypoxic reopenings. The time course of SUMOylation of single channels in response to hypoxia coincides with the increase in ILATE, a reaction that is complete in under 100 s. In human cardiac myocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells, hypoxia-induced ILATE is confirmed to be SUMO-dependent and to produce action potential prolongation, the pro-arrhythmic change observed in patients.

Abstract: Endothelial injury is regarded as the initial pathological process in diabetic vascular diseases, but effective therapy has not yet been identified. Although β-hydroxybutyrate plays various protective roles in the cardiovascular system, its ability to antagonize diabetic endothelial injury is unclear. β-hydroxybutyrate reportedly causes histone H3K9 β-hydroxybutyrylation (H3K9bhb), which activates gene expression; however, there has been no report regarding the role of H3K9bhb in up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a crucial factor in endothelial integrity and function. Here, male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes, and then treated with different concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate. After 10 weeks, body weight, blood glucose, morphological changes and serum nitric oxide concentration were examined. Moreover, the mRNA expression level, protein content and distribution of VEGF in the aorta were investigated, as were total protein β-hydroxybutyrylation and H3K9bhb contents. The results showed injury of aortic endothelium, along with reductions of the concentration of nitric oxide and generation of VEGF in diabetic rats. However, β-hydroxybutyrate treatment attenuated diabetic injury of the endothelium and up-regulated the generation of VEGF. Furthermore, β-hydroxybutyrate treatment caused marked total protein β-hydroxybutyrylation and significant elevation of H3K9bhb content in the aorta of diabetic rats. The ability of β-hydroxybutyrate to protect against diabetic injury of the aortic endothelium was greatest for its intermediate concentration. In conclusion, moderately elevated β-hydroxybutyrate could antagonize aortic endothelial injury, potentially by causing H3K9bhb to promote generation of VEGF in diabetic rats.

Abstract: Summary
An aberrant increase in pluripotency gene (PpG) expression due to enhancer reactivation could induce stemness and enhance the tumorigenicity of cancer stem cells. Silencing of PpG enhancers (PpGe) during embryonic stem cell differentiation involves Lsd1-mediated H3K4me1 demethylation and DNA methylation. Here, we observed retention of H3K4me1 and DNA hypomethylation at PpGe associated with a partial repression of PpGs in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs) post-differentiation. H3K4me1 demethylation in F9 ECCs could not be rescued by Lsd1 overexpression. Given our observation that H3K4me1 demethylation is accompanied by strong Oct4 repression in P19 ECCs, we tested if Oct4 interaction with Lsd1 affects its catalytic activity. Our data show a dose-dependent inhibition of Lsd1 activity by Oct4 and retention of H3K4me1 at PpGe in Oct4-overexpressing P19 ECCs. These data suggest that Lsd1-Oct4 interaction in cancer stem cells could establish a “primed” enhancer state that is susceptible to reactivation, leading to aberrant PpG expression.

Abstract: Summary
Periostin is a multifunctional extracellular matrix protein involved in various inflammatory diseases and tumor metastasis; however, evidence regarding whether and how periostin actively contributes to inflammation-associated tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that periostin deficiency significantly inhibits the occurrence of colorectal cancer in azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice and in ApcMin/+ mice. Moreover, periostin deficiency attenuates the severity of colitis and reduces the proliferation of tumor cells. Mechanistically, stromal fibroblast-derived periostin activates FAK-Src kinases through integrin-mediated outside-in signaling, which results in the activation of YAP/TAZ and, subsequently, IL-6 expression in tumor cells. Conversely, IL-6 induces periostin expression in fibroblasts by activating STAT3, which ultimately facilitates colorectal tumor development. These findings provide the evidence that periostin promotes colorectal tumorigenesis, and identify periostin- and IL-6-mediated tumor-stroma interaction as a promising target for treating colitis-associated colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Defective cholesterol efflux pathways in mice promote the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and a bias toward the myeloid lineage, as observed in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Here, we identify 5 somatic missense mutations in ABCA1 in 26 patients with CMML. These mutations confer a proliferative advantage to monocytic leukemia cell lines in vitro. In vivo inactivation of ABCA1 or expression of ABCA1 mutants in hematopoietic cells in the setting of Tet2 loss demonstrates a myelosuppressive function of ABCA1. Mechanistically, ABCA1 mutations impair the tumor-suppressor functions of WT ABCA1 in myeloproliferative neoplasms by increasing the IL-3Rβ signaling via MAPK and JAK2 and subsequent metabolic reprogramming. Overexpression of a human apolipoprotein A-1 transgene dampens myeloproliferation. These findings identify somatic mutations in ABCA1 that subvert its anti-proliferative and cholesterol efflux functions and permit the progression of myeloid neoplasms. Therapeutic increases in HDL bypass these defects and restore normal hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
EWSR1-FLI1, the chimeric oncogene specific for Ewing sarcoma (EwS), induces a cascade of signaling events leading to cell transformation. However, it remains elusive how genetically homogeneous EwS cells can drive the heterogeneity of transcriptional programs. Here, we combine independent component analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from diverse cell types and model systems with time-resolved mapping of EWSR1-FLI1 binding sites and of open chromatin regions to characterize dynamic cellular processes associated with EWSR1-FLI1 activity. We thus define an exquisitely specific and direct enhancer-driven EWSR1-FLI1 program. In EwS tumors, cell proliferation and strong oxidative phosphorylation metabolism are associated with a well-defined range of EWSR1-FLI1 activity. In contrast, a subpopulation of cells from below and above the intermediary EWSR1-FLI1 activity is characterized by increased hypoxia. Overall, our study reveals sources of intratumoral heterogeneity within EwS tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Morphological constancy is universal in developing systems. It is unclear whether precise morphogenesis stems from faithful mechanical interpretation of gene expression patterns. We investigate the formation of the cephalic furrow, an epithelial fold that is precisely positioned with a linear morphology. Fold initiation is specified by a precise genetic code with single-cell row resolution. This positional code activates and spatially confines lateral myosin contractility to induce folding. However, 20% of initiating cells are mis-specified because of fluctuating myosin intensities at the cellular level. Nevertheless, the furrow remains linearly aligned. We find that lateral myosin is planar polarized, integrating contractile membrane interfaces into supracellular “ribbons.” Local reduction of mechanical coupling at the “ribbons” using optogenetics decreases furrow linearity. Furthermore, 3D vertex modeling indicates that polarized, interconnected contractility confers morphological robustness against noise. Thus, tissue-scale mechanical coupling functions as a denoising mechanism to ensure morphogenetic precision despite noisy decoding of positional information.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian heart is incapable of regenerating a sufficient number of cardiomyocytes to ameliorate the loss of contractile muscle after acute myocardial injury. Several reports have demonstrated that mononucleated cardiomyocytes are more responsive than are binucleated cardiomyocytes to pro-proliferative stimuli. We have developed a strategy to isolate and characterize highly enriched populations of mononucleated and binucleated cardiomyocytes at various times of development. Our results suggest that an E2f/Rb transcriptional network is central to the divergence of these two populations and that remnants of the differences acquired during the neonatal period remain in adult cardiomyocytes. Moreover, inducing binucleation by genetically blocking the ability of cardiomyocytes to complete cytokinesis leads to a reduction in E2f target gene expression, directly linking the E2f pathway with nucleation. These data identify key molecular differences between mononucleated and binucleated mammalian cardiomyocytes that can be used to leverage cardiomyocyte proliferation for promoting injury repair in the heart.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is an aggressive and heterogeneous entity of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. To identify molecular subtypes of NKTCL based on genomic structural alterations and EBV sequences, we performed multi-omics study on 128 biopsy samples of newly diagnosed NKTCL and defined three prominent subtypes, which differ significantly in cell of origin, EBV gene expression, transcriptional signatures, and responses to asparaginase-based regimens and targeted therapy. Our findings thus identify molecular networks of EBV-associated pathogenesis and suggest potential clinical strategies on NKTCL.

Epithelial-repair-dependent mucosal healing (MH) is associated with a more favorable prognosis for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). MH is accomplished via repair and regeneration of the intestinal epithelium. However, the mechanism underlying MH is ill defined. We found a striking upregulation of peroxisomes in the injured crypts of IBD patients. By increasing peroxisome levels in Drosophila midguts, we found that peroxisome elevation enhanced RAB7-dependent late endosome maturation, which then promoted stem and/or progenitor-cell differentiation via modulation of Janus Kinase (JAK) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)-SOX21A signaling. This in turn enhanced ISC-mediated regeneration. Importantly, RAB7 and SOX21 were upregulated in the crypts of IBD patients. Moreover, administration of drugs that increased peroxisome levels reversed the symptoms of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. This study demonstrates a peroxisome-mediated epithelial repair mechanism, which opens a therapeutic avenue for the enhancement of MH in IBD patients.

Abstract: Pacemaker action potentials emerge from the sinoatrial node (SAN) and rapidly propagate through the atria to the AV node via preferential conduction pathways, including one associated with the coronary sinus. However, few distinguishing features of these tracts are known. Identifying specific molecular markers to distinguish among these conduction pathways will have important implications for understanding atrial conduction and atrial arrhythmogenesis. Using a Stim1 reporter mouse, we discovered stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1)-expressing coronary sinus cardiomyocytes (CSC)s in a tract from the SAN to the coronary sinus. Our studies here establish that STIM1 is a molecular marker of CSCs and we propose a role for STIM1-CSCs in interatrial conduction. Deletion of Stim1 from the CSCs slowed interatrial conduction and increased susceptibility to atrial arrhythmias. Store-operated Ca2+ currents (Isoc) in response to Ca2+ store depletion were markedly reduced in CSCs and their action potentials showed electrical remodeling. Our studies identify STIM1 as a molecular marker for a coronary sinus interatrial conduction pathway. We propose a role for SOCE in Ca2+ signaling of CSCs and implicate STIM1 in atrial arrhythmogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
We perform a CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide screen in glioblastoma stem cells and identify integrin αvβ5 as an internalization factor for Zika virus (ZIKV). Expression of αvβ5 is correlated with ZIKV susceptibility in various cells and tropism in developing human cerebral cortex. A blocking antibody against integrin αvβ5, but not αvβ3, efficiently inhibits ZIKV infection. ZIKV binds to cells but fails to internalize when treated with integrin αvβ5-blocking antibody. αvβ5 directly binds to ZIKV virions and activates focal adhesion kinase, which is required for ZIKV infection. Finally, αvβ5 blocking antibody or two inhibitors, SB273005 and cilengitide, reduces ZIKV infection and alleviates ZIKV-induced pathology in human neural stem cells and in mouse brain. Altogether, our findings identify integrin αvβ5 as an internalization factor for ZIKV, providing a promising therapeutic target, as well as two drug candidates for prophylactic use or treatments for ZIKV infections.

Abstract: Calcium (Ca2+) release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels mediated by STIM1/2 and ORAI (ORAI1-3) proteins form the dominant store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway in a wide variety of cells. Among these, the enamel-forming cells known as ameloblasts rely on CRAC channel function to enable Ca2+ influx, which is important for enamel mineralization. This key role of the CRAC channel is supported by human mutations and animal models lacking STIM1 and ORAI1, which results in enamel defects and hypomineralization. A number of recent reports have highlighted the role of the chanzyme TRPM7 (transient receptor potential melastanin 7), a transmembrane protein containing an ion channel permeable to divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+), as a modulator of SOCE. This raises the question as to whether TRPM7 should be considered an alternative route for Ca2+ influx, or if TRPM7 modifies CRAC channel activity in enamel cells. To address these questions, we monitored Ca2+ influx mediated by SOCE using the pharmacological TRPM7 activator naltriben and the inhibitor NS8593 in rat primary enamel cells and in the murine ameloblast cell line LS8 cells stimulated with thapsigargin. We also measured Ca2+ dynamics in ORAI1/2-deficient (shOrai1/2) LS8 cells and in cells with siRNA knock-down of Trpm7. We found that primary enamel cells stimulated with the TRPM7 activator potentiated Ca2+ influx via SOCE compared to control cells. However, blockade of TRPM7 with NS8593 did not decrease the SOCE peak. Furthermore, activation of TRPM7 in shOrai1/2 LS8 cells lacking SOCE failed to elicit Ca2+ influx, and Trpm7 knock-down had no effect on SOCE. Taken together, our data suggest that TRPM7 is a positive modulator of SOCE potentiating Ca2+ influx in enamel cells, but its function is fully dependent on the prior activation of the ORAI channels.

Abstract: Summary
Age-dependent loss of hypothalamic neural stem cells (htNSCs) is important for the pathological consequences of aging; however, it is unclear what drives the senescence of htNSCs. Here, we report that a long non-coding RNA, Hnscr, is abundantly expressed in the htNSCs of young mice but decreases markedly in middle-aged mice. We show that depletion of Hnscr is sufficient to drive the senescence of htNSCs and aging-like phenotypes in mice. Mechanistically, Hnscr binds to Y-box protein 1 (YB-1) to prevent its degradation and thus the attenuation of transcription of the senescence marker gene p16INK4A. Through molecular docking, we discovered that a naturally occurring small compound, theaflavin 3-gallate, can mimic the activity of Hnscr. Treatment of middle-aged mice with theaflavin 3-gallate reduced the senescence of htNSCs while improving aging-associated pathology. These results point to a mediator of the aging process and one that can be pharmacologically targeted to improve aging-related outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Muscle regeneration relies on the regulation of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) through paracrine signaling interactions. We analyzed muscle regeneration in mice using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and generated over 34,000 single-cell transcriptomes spanning four time-points. We identified 15 distinct cell types including heterogenous populations of muscle stem and progenitor cells. We resolved a hierarchical map of these myogenic cells by trajectory inference and observed stage-specific regulatory programs within this continuum. Through ligand-receptor interaction analysis, we identified over 100 candidate regeneration-associated paracrine communication pairs between MuSCs and non-myogenic cells. We show that myogenic stem/progenitor cells exhibit heterogeneous expression of multiple Syndecan proteins in cycling myogenic cells, suggesting that Syndecans may coordinate myogenic fate regulation. We performed ligand stimulation in vitro and confirmed that three paracrine factors (FGF2, TGFβ1, and RSPO3) regulate myogenic cell proliferation in a Syndecan-dependent manner. Our study provides a scRNA-seq reference resource to investigate cell communication interactions in muscle regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are key organelles for brain health. Mitochondrial alterations have been reported in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the comprehension of the underlying mechanisms appears crucial to understand their relationship with the pathology. Using multiple genetic, pharmacological, imaging, and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that, in different familial AD cell models, mitochondrial ATP synthesis is affected. The defect depends on reduced mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, due to both lower Ca2+-mediated stimulation of the Krebs cycle and dampened mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. Importantly, this latter event is linked to glycogen-synthase-kinase-3β (GSK-3β) hyper-activation, leading, in turn, to impaired recruitment of hexokinase 1 (HK1) to mitochondria, destabilization of mitochondrial-pyruvate-carrier (MPC) complexes, and decreased MPC2 protein levels. Remarkably, pharmacological GSK-3β inhibition in AD cells rescues MPC2 expression and improves mitochondrial ATP synthesis and respiration. The defective mitochondrial bioenergetics influences glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity, thus representing a possible target for future therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Summary
LMNA encodes nuclear Lamin A/C that tethers lamina-associated domains (LADs) to the nuclear periphery. Mutations in LMNA cause degenerative disorders including the premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, but the mechanisms are unknown. We report that Ser22-phosphorylated (pS22) Lamin A/C was localized to the nuclear interior in human fibroblasts throughout the cell cycle. pS22-Lamin A/C interacted with a subset of putative active enhancers, not LADs, at locations co-bound by the transcriptional activator c-Jun. In progeria-patient fibroblasts, a subset of pS22-Lamin A/C-binding sites were lost, whereas new pS22-Lamin A/C-binding sites emerged in normally quiescent loci. New pS22-Lamin A/C binding was accompanied by increased histone acetylation, increased c-Jun binding, and upregulation of nearby genes implicated in progeria pathophysiology. These results suggest that Lamin A/C regulates gene expression by enhancer binding. Disruption of the gene regulatory rather than LAD tethering function of Lamin A/C may underlie the pathogenesis of disorders caused by LMNA mutations.

Abstract: Summary
The use of cetuximab anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies has opened the era of targeted and personalized therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). Poor response rates have been unequivocally shown in mutant KRAS and are even observed in a majority of wild-type KRAS tumors. Therefore, patient selection based on mutational profiling remains problematic. We previously identified methylglyoxal (MGO), a by-product of glycolysis, as a metabolite promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Mutant KRAS cells under MGO stress show AKT-dependent survival when compared with wild-type KRAS isogenic CRC cells. MGO induces AKT activation through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin 2 (mTORC2) and Hsp27 regulation. Importantly, the sole induction of MGO stress in sensitive wild-type KRAS cells renders them resistant to cetuximab. MGO scavengers inhibit AKT and resensitize KRAS-mutated CRC cells to cetuximab in vivo. This study establishes a link between MGO and AKT activation and pinpoints this oncometabolite as a potential target to tackle EGFR-targeted therapy resistance in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-resident memory T cells have critical roles in long-term pathogen and tumor immune surveillance in the liver. We investigate the role of autophagy in equipping human memory T cells to acquire tissue residence and maintain functionality in the immunosuppressive liver environment. By performing ex vivo staining of freshly isolated cells from human liver tissue, we find that an increased rate of basal autophagy is a hallmark of intrahepatic lymphocytes, particularly liver-resident CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells with increased autophagy are those best able to proliferate and mediate cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Conversely, blocking autophagy induction results in the accumulation of depolarized mitochondria, a feature of exhausted T cells. Primary hepatic stellate cells or the prototypic hepatic cytokine interleukin (IL)-15 induce autophagy in parallel with tissue-homing/retention markers. Inhibition of T cell autophagy abrogates tissue-residence programming. Thus, upregulation of autophagy adapts CD8+ T cells to combat mitochondrial depolarization, optimize functionality, and acquire tissue residence.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of embryonic diapause, dormancy that interrupts the tight connection between developmental stage and time, is still poorly understood. Here, we characterize the transcriptional and metabolite profiles of mouse diapause embryos and identify unique gene expression and metabolic signatures with activated lipolysis, glycolysis, and metabolic pathways regulated by AMPK. Lipolysis is increased due to mTORC2 repression, increasing fatty acids to support cell survival. We further show that starvation in pre-implantation ICM-derived mouse ESCs induces a reversible dormant state, transcriptionally mimicking the in vivo diapause stage. During starvation, Lkb1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, represses mTOR, which induces a reversible glycolytic and epigenetically H4K16Ac-negative, diapause-like state. Diapause furthermore activates expression of glutamine transporters SLC38A1/2. We show by genetic and small molecule inhibitors that glutamine transporters are essential for the H4K16Ac-negative, diapause state. These data suggest that mTORC1/2 inhibition, regulated by amino acid levels, is causal for diapause metabolism and epigenetic state.

Abstract: Summary
Microexons represent the most highly conserved class of alternative splicing, yet their functions are poorly understood. Here, we focus on closely related neuronal microexons overlapping prion-like domains in the translation initiation factors, eIF4G1 and eIF4G3, the splicing of which is activity dependent and frequently disrupted in autism. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of these microexons selectively upregulates synaptic proteins that control neuronal activity and plasticity and further triggers a gene expression program mirroring that of activated neurons. Mice lacking the Eif4g1 microexon display social behavior, learning, and memory deficits, accompanied by altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We provide evidence that the eIF4G microexons function as a translational brake by causing ribosome stalling, through their propensity to promote the coalescence of cytoplasmic granule components associated with translation repression, including the fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP. The results thus reveal an autism-disrupted mechanism by which alternative splicing specializes neuronal translation to control higher order cognitive functioning.

Abstract: Summary
The expression of multiple growth-promoting genes is coordinated by the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie with its major regulatory input provided by the Hippo-Warts kinase cascade. Here, we identify Atg1/ULK1-mediated phosphorylation of Yorkie as an additional inhibitory input independent of the Hippo-Warts pathway. Two serine residues in Yorkie, S74 and S97, are Atg1/ULK1 consensus target sites and are phosphorylated by ULK1 in vitro, thereby preventing its binding to Scalloped. In vivo, gain of function of Atg1, or its activator Acinus, caused elevated Yorkie phosphorylation and inhibited Yorkie’s growth-promoting activity. Loss of function of Atg1 or Acinus raised expression of Yorkie target genes and increased tissue size. Unlike Atg1’s role in autophagy, Atg1-mediated phosphorylation of Yorkie does not require Atg13. Atg1 is activated by starvation and other cellular stressors and therefore can impose temporary stress-induced constraints on the growth-promoting gene networks under the control of Hippo-Yorkie signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Determining the off-target cleavage profile of programmable nucleases is an important consideration for any genome editing experiment, and a number of Cas9 variants have been reported that improve specificity. We describe here tagmentation-based tag integration site sequencing (TTISS), an efficient, scalable method for analyzing double-strand breaks (DSBs) that we apply in parallel to eight Cas9 variants across 59 targets. Additionally, we generated thousands of other Cas9 variants and screened for variants with enhanced specificity and activity, identifying LZ3 Cas9, a high specificity variant with a unique +1 insertion profile. This comprehensive comparison reveals a general trade-off between Cas9 activity and specificity and provides information about the frequency of generation of +1 insertions, which has implications for correcting frameshift mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies suggest that a key mechanism whereby the gut microbiome influences energy balance and glucose homeostasis is through the recruitment of brown and beige adipocytes, primary mediators of the adaptive thermogenic response. To test this, we assessed energy expenditure and glucose metabolism in two complementary mouse models of gut microbial deficiency, which were exposed to a broad range of thermal and dietary stresses. Neither ablation of the gut microbiome, nor the substantial microbial perturbations induced by cold ambient temperatures, influenced energy expenditure during cold exposure or high-fat feeding. Nevertheless, we demonstrated a critical role for gut microbial metabolism in maintaining euglycemia through the production of amino acid metabolites that optimized hepatic TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle fluxes in support of gluconeogenesis. These results distinguish the dispensability of the gut microbiome for the regulation of energy expenditure from its critical contribution to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Continual efferocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) by macrophages prevents necrosis and promotes injury resolution. How continual efferocytosis is promoted is not clear. Here, we show that the process is optimized by linking the metabolism of engulfed cargo from initial efferocytic events to subsequent rounds. We found that continual efferocytosis is enhanced by the metabolism of AC-derived arginine and ornithine to putrescine by macrophage arginase 1 (Arg1) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Putrescine augments HuR-mediated stabilization of the mRNA encoding the GTP-exchange factor Dbl, which activates actin-regulating Rac1 to facilitate subsequent rounds of AC internalization. Inhibition of any step along this pathway after first-AC uptake suppresses second-AC internalization, whereas putrescine addition rescues this defect. Mice lacking myeloid Arg1 or ODC have defects in efferocytosis in vivo and in atherosclerosis regression, while treatment with putrescine promotes atherosclerosis resolution. Thus, macrophage metabolism of AC-derived metabolites allows for optimal continual efferocytosis and resolution of injury.

Abstract: Ionic signalling is the most ancient form of regulation of cellular functions in response to environmental challenges. Signals, mediated by Na+ fluxes and spatio-temporal fluctuations of Na+ concentration in cellular organelles and cellular compartments contribute to the most fundamental cellular processes such as membrane excitability and energy production. At the very core of ionic signalling lies the Na+-K+ ATP-driven pump (or NKA) which creates trans-plasmalemmal ion gradients that sustain ionic fluxes through ion channels and numerous Na+-dependent transporters that maintain cellular and tissue homeostasis. Here we present a brief account of the history of research into NKA, Na+ -dependent transporters and Na+ signalling.

Abstract: Summary
circSLC45A4 is the main RNA splice isoform produced from its genetic locus and one of the highest expressed circRNAs in the developing human frontal cortex. Knockdown of this highly conserved circRNA in a human neuroblastoma cell line is sufficient to induce spontaneous neuronal differentiation, measurable by increased expression of neuronal marker genes. Depletion of circSlc45a4 in the developing mouse cortex causes a significant reduction of the basal progenitor pool and increases the expression of neurogenic regulators. Furthermore, knockdown of circSlc45a4a induces a significant depletion of cells in the cortical plate. In addition, deconvolution of the bulk RNA-seq data with the help of single-cell RNA-seq data validates the depletion of basal progenitors and reveals an increase in Cajal-Retzius cells. In summary, we present a detailed study of a highly conserved circular RNA that is necessary to maintain the pool of neural progenitors in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal migration, axon fasciculation, and axon guidance need to be closely coordinated for neural circuit assembly. Spinal motor neurons (MNs) face unique challenges during development because their cell bodies reside within the central nervous system (CNS) and their axons project to various targets in the body periphery. The molecular mechanisms that contain MN somata within the spinal cord while allowing their axons to exit the CNS and navigate to their final destinations remain incompletely understood. We find that the MN cell surface protein TAG-1 anchors MN cell bodies in the spinal cord to prevent their emigration, mediates motor axon fasciculation during CNS exit, and guides motor axons past dorsal root ganglia. TAG-1 executes these varied functions in MN development independently of one another. Our results identify TAG-1 as a key multifunctional regulator of MN wiring that coordinates neuronal migration, axon fasciculation, and axon guidance.

Abstract: Summary
Human rhinoviruses cause the common cold and exacerbate chronic respiratory diseases. Although infection elicits neutralizing antibodies, these do not persist or cross-protect across multiple rhinovirus strains. To analyze rhinovirus-specific B cell responses in humans, we developed techniques using intact RV-A16 and RV-A39 for high-throughput high-dimensional single-cell analysis, with parallel assessment of antibody isotypes in an experimental infection model. Our approach identified T-bet+ B cells binding both viruses that account for ∼5% of CXCR5− memory B cells. These B cells infiltrate nasal tissue and expand in the blood after infection. Their rapid secretion of heterotypic immunoglobulin G (IgG) in vitro, but not IgA, matches the nasal antibody profile post-infection. By contrast, CXCR5+ memory B cells binding a single virus are clonally distinct, absent in nasal tissue, and secrete homotypic IgG and IgA, mirroring the systemic response. Temporal and spatial functions of dichotomous memory B cells might explain the ability to resolve infection while rendering the host susceptible to re-infection.

Abstract: Summary
During metastasis, cancer cells are exposed to potentially destructive hemodynamic forces including fluid shear stress (FSS) while en route to distant sites. However, prior work indicates that cancer cells are more resistant to brief pulses of high-level FSS in vitro relative to non-transformed epithelial cells. Herein, we identify a mechano-adaptive mechanism of FSS resistance in cancer cells. Our findings demonstrate that cancer cells activate RhoA in response to FSS, which protects them from FSS-induced plasma membrane damage. We show that cancer cells freshly isolated from mouse and human tumors are resistant to FSS, that formin and myosin II activity protects circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from destruction, and that short-term inhibition of myosin II delays metastasis in mouse models. Collectively, our data indicate that viable CTCs actively resist destruction by hemodynamic forces and are likely to be more mechanically robust than is commonly thought.

Abstract: Summary
RNA decay is crucial for mRNA turnover and surveillance and misregulated in many diseases. This complex system is challenging to study, particularly in mammals, where it remains unclear whether decay pathways perform specialized versus redundant roles. Cytoplasmic pathways and links to translation are particularly enigmatic. By directly profiling decay factor targets and normal versus aberrant translation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we uncovered extensive decay pathway specialization and crosstalk with translation. XRN1 (5′-3′) mediates cytoplasmic bulk mRNA turnover whereas SKIV2L (3′-5′) is universally recruited by ribosomes, tackling aberrant translation and sometimes modulating mRNA abundance. Further exploring translation surveillance revealed AVEN and FOCAD as SKIV2L interactors. AVEN prevents ribosome stalls at structured regions, which otherwise require SKIV2L for clearance. This pathway is crucial for histone translation, upstream open reading frame (uORF) regulation, and counteracting ribosome arrest on small ORFs. In summary, we uncovered key targets, components, and functions of mammalian RNA decay pathways and extensive coupling to translation.

Abstract: Summary
The Drosophila wing has served as a paradigm to mechanistically characterize the role of morphogens in patterning and growth. Wingless (Wg) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) are expressed in two orthogonal signaling centers, and their gradients organize patterning by regulating the expression of well-defined target genes. By contrast, graded activity of these morphogens is not an absolute requirement for wing growth. Despite their permissive role in regulating growth, here we show that Wg and Dpp are utilized in a non-interchangeable manner by the two existing orthogonal signaling centers to promote preferential growth along the two different axes of the developing wing. Our data indicate that these morphogens promote anisotropic growth by making use of distinct and non-interchangeable molecular mechanisms. Whereas Dpp drives growth along the anterior-posterior axis by maintaining Brinker levels below a growth-repressing threshold, Wg exerts its action along the proximal-distal axis through a double repression mechanism involving T cell factor (TCF).

Abstract: Summary
The beta (β)-cell mass formed during embryogenesis is amplified by cell replication during fetal and early postnatal development. Thereafter, β cells become functionally mature, and their mass is maintained by a low rate of replication. For those few β cells that replicate in adult life, it is not known how replication is initiated nor whether this occurs in a specialized subset of β cells. We capitalized on a YAP overexpression system to induce replication of stem-cell-derived β cells and, by single-cell RNA sequencing, identified an upregulation of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) pathway. Activation of the LIF pathway induces replication of human β cells in vitro and in vivo. The expression of the LIF receptor is restricted to a subset of transcriptionally distinct human β cells with increased proliferative capacity. This study delineates novel genetic networks that control the replication of LIF-responsive, replication-competent human β cells.

Abstract: The jugular ganglion (JG) contains sensory neurons of the vagus nerve which innervate somatic and visceral structures in cranial and cervical regions. In this study, the number of sensory neurons in the human JG was investigated. And, the morphology of sensory neurons in the human JG and nodose ganglion (NG) was compared. The estimated number of JG neurons was 2721.8–9301.1 (average number of sensory neurons ± S.D. = 7975.1 ± 3312.8). There was no significant difference in sizes of the neuronal cell body and nucleus within the JG (cell body, 1128.8 ± 99.7 μ m2; nucleus, 127.7 ± 20.8 μ m2) and NG (cell body, 963.8 ± 225.7 μ m2; nucleus, 123.2 ± 32.3 μ m2). These findings indicate that most of sensory neurons show the similar morphology in the JG and NG. Our immunohistochemical method also demonstrated the distribution of ion channels, neurotransmitter agents and calcium-binding proteins in the human JG. Numerous JG neurons were immunoreactive for transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1, mean ± SD = 19.9 ± 11.5 %) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP, 28.4 ± 6.7 %). A moderate number of JG neurons contained TRPV2 (12.0 ± 4.7 %), substance P (SP, 15.7 ± 6.9 %) and secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine-like 1 (SPARCL1, 14.6 ± 7.4 %). A few JG neurons had vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2, 5.6 ± 2.9 %) and parvalbumin (PV, 2.3 ± 1.4 %). SP- and TRPV2-containing JG neurons had mainly small and medium-sized cell bodies, respectively. TRPV1- and VGLUT2- containing JG neurons were small to medium-sized. CGRP- and SPARCL1-containing JG neurons were of various cell body sizes. Sensory neurons in the human JG were mostly free of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). In the external auditory canal skin, subepithelial nerve fibers contained TRPV1, TRPV2, SP, CGRP and VGLUT2. Perivascular nerve fibers also had TRPV1, TRPV2, SP, CGRP, VIP, NPY and TH. However, PV- and SPARCL1-containing nerve endings could not be seen in the external auditory canal. It is likely that sensory neurons in the human JG can transduce nociceptive and mechanoreceptive information from the external auditory canal. Theses neurons may be also associated with neurogenic inflammation in the external auditory canal and ear-cough reflex through the vagus nerve.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted knockin mediated by double-stranded DNA cleavage is accompanied by unwanted insertions and deletions (indels) at on-target and off-target sites. A nick-mediated approach scarcely generates indels but exhibits reduced efficiency of targeted knockin. Here, we demonstrate that tandem paired nicking, a method for targeted knockin involving two Cas9 nickases that create nicks at the homologous regions of the donor DNA and the genome in the same strand, scarcely creates indels at the edited genomic loci, while permitting the efficiency of targeted knockin largely equivalent to that of the Cas9-nuclease-based approach. Tandem paired nicking seems to accomplish targeted knockin by DNA recombination analogous to Holliday’s model and creates intended genomic changes without introducing additional nucleotide changes, such as silent mutations. Targeted knockin through tandem paired nicking neither triggers significant p53 activation nor occurs preferentially in p53-suppressed cells. These properties of tandem paired nicking demonstrate its utility in precision genome engineering.

Abstract: Summary
We find that cardiac group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are essential for the development of IL-33-induced eosinophilic pericarditis. We show a pathogenic role for ILC2s in cardiac inflammation, in which ILC2s activated by IL-33 drive the development of eosinophilic pericarditis in collaboration with cardiac fibroblasts. ILCs, not T and B cells, are required for the development of pericarditis. ILC2s transferred to the heart of Rag2−/−Il2rg−/− mice restore their susceptibility to eosinophil infiltration. Moreover, ILC2s direct cardiac fibroblasts to produce eotaxin-1. We also find that eosinophils reside in the mediastinal cavity and that eosinophils transferred to the mediastinal cavity of eosinophil-deficient ΔdblGATA1 mice following IL-33 treatment migrate to the heart. Thus, the serous cavities may serve as a reservoir of cardiac-infiltrating eosinophils. In humans, patients with pericarditis show higher amounts of ILCs in pericardial fluid than do healthy controls and patients with other cardiac diseases. We demonstrate that ILCs play a critical role in pericarditis.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor p53 transcriptionally activates target genes to suppress cellular proliferation during stress. p53 has also been implicated in the repression of the proto-oncogene Myc, but the mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we identify Pvt1b, a p53-dependent isoform of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Pvt1, expressed 50 kb downstream of Myc, which becomes induced by DNA damage or oncogenic signaling and accumulates near its site of transcription. We show that production of the Pvt1b RNA is necessary and sufficient to suppress Myc transcription in cis without altering the chromatin organization of the locus. Inhibition of Pvt1b increases Myc levels and transcriptional activity and promotes cellular proliferation. Furthermore, Pvt1b loss accelerates tumor growth, but not tumor progression, in an autochthonous mouse model of lung cancer. These findings demonstrate that Pvt1b acts at the intersection of the p53 and Myc transcriptional networks to reinforce the anti-proliferative activities of p53.

Abstract: Summary
Bone metabolism depends on the balance between osteoclast-driven bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation. Diseases like osteoporosis are characterized by increased bone destruction due to partially enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Here, we report that the post-translational SUMO modification is critical for regulating osteoclastogenesis. The expression of the SUMO-specific protease SENP3 is downregulated in osteoclast precursors during osteoclast differentiation. Mice with SENP3 deficiency in bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMDMs) exhibit more severe bone loss due to over-activation of osteoclasts after ovariectomy. Deleting SENP3 in BMDMs promotes osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, loss of SENP3 increases interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) SUMO3 modification at the K310 amino acid site, which upregulates expression of the nuclear factor of activated T cell c1 (NFATc1) and osteoclastogenesis. In summary, IRF8 de-SUMO modification mediated by SENP3 suppresses osteoclast differentiation and suggests strategies to treat bone loss diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin states must be maintained during cell proliferation to uphold cellular identity and genome integrity. Inheritance of histone modifications is central in this process. However, the histone modification landscape is challenged by incorporation of new unmodified histones during each cell cycle, and the principles governing heritability remain unclear. We take a quantitative computational modeling approach to describe propagation of histone H3K27 and H3K36 methylation states. We measure combinatorial H3K27 and H3K36 methylation patterns by quantitative mass spectrometry on subsequent generations of histones. Using model comparison, we reject active global demethylation and invoke the existence of domains defined by distinct methylation endpoints. We find that H3K27me3 on pre-existing histones stimulates the rate of de novo H3K27me3 establishment, supporting a read-write mechanism in timely chromatin restoration. Finally, we provide a detailed quantitative picture of the mutual antagonism between H3K27 and H3K36 methylation and propose that it stabilizes epigenetic states across cell division.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria import nearly their entire proteome from the cytoplasm by translocating precursor proteins through the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex. Here, we show dynamic regulation of mitochondrial import by the ubiquitin system. Acute pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of the mitochondrial deubiquitinase (DUB) USP30 triggers accumulation of Ub-substrates that are normally localized inside the mitochondria. Mitochondrial import of USP30 substrates is impaired in USP30 knockout (KO) cells, suggesting that deubiquitination promotes efficient import. Upstream of USP30, the E3 ligase March5 ubiquitinates mitochondrial proteins whose eventual import depends on USP30. In USP30 KOs, exogenous March5 expression induces accumulation of unimported translocation intermediates that are degraded by the proteasomes. In USP30 KO mice, TOM subunits have reduced abundance across multiple tissues. Together these data highlight how protein import into a subcellular compartment can be regulated by ubiquitination and deubiquitination by E3 ligase and DUB machinery positioned at the gate.

Abstract: Summary
We have discovered that basement membrane and its major components can induce rapid, strikingly robust fibronectin organization. In this new matrix assembly mechanism, α5β1 integrin-based focal adhesions slide actively on the underlying matrix toward the ventral cell center through the dynamic shortening of myosin IIA-associated actin stress fibers to drive rapid fibronectin fibrillogenesis distal to the adhesion. This mechanism contrasts with classical fibronectin assembly based on stable or fixed-position focal adhesions containing αVβ3 integrins plus α5β1 integrin translocation into proximal fibrillar adhesions. On basement membrane components, these sliding focal adhesions contain standard focal adhesion constituents but completely lack classical αVβ3 integrins. Instead, peripheral α3β1 or α2β1 adhesions mediate initial cell attachment but over time are switched to α5β1 integrin-based sliding focal adhesions to assemble fibronectin matrix. This basement-membrane-triggered mechanism produces rapid fibronectin fibrillogenesis, providing a mechanistic explanation for the well-known widespread accumulation of fibronectin at many organ basement membranes.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription initiation requires formation of the open promoter complex (RPo). To generate RPo, RNA polymerase (RNAP) unwinds the DNA duplex to form the transcription bubble and loads the DNA into the RNAP active site. RPo formation is a multi-step process with transient intermediates of unknown structure. We use single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to visualize seven intermediates containing Escherichia coli RNAP with the transcription factor TraR en route to forming RPo. The structures span the RPo formation pathway from initial recognition of the duplex promoter in a closed complex to the final RPo. The structures and supporting biochemical data define RNAP and promoter DNA conformational changes that delineate steps on the pathway, including previously undetected transient promoter-RNAP interactions that contribute to populating the intermediates but do not occur in RPo. Our work provides a structural basis for understanding RPo formation and its regulation, a major checkpoint in gene expression throughout evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Innate regeneration following digit tip amputation is one of the few examples of epimorphic regeneration in mammals. Digit tip regeneration is mediated by the blastema, the same structure invoked during limb regeneration in some lower vertebrates. By genetic lineage analyses, the digit tip blastema has been defined as a population of heterogeneous, lineage-restricted progenitor cells. These previous studies, however, do not comprehensively evaluate blastema heterogeneity or address lineage restriction of closely related cell types. In this report, we present single-cell RNA sequencing of over 38,000 cells from mouse digit tip blastemas and unamputated control digit tips and generate an atlas of the cell types participating in digit tip regeneration. We computationally define differentiation trajectories of vascular, monocytic, and fibroblastic lineages over regeneration, and while our data confirm broad lineage restriction of progenitors, our analysis reveals 67 genes enriched in blastema fibroblasts including a novel regeneration-specific gene, Mest.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused an explosive epidemic linked to severe clinical outcomes in the Americas. As of June 2018, 4,929 ZIKV suspected infections and 46 congenital syndrome cases had been reported in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Although Manaus is a key demographic hub in the Amazon region, little is known about the ZIKV epidemic there, in terms of both transmission and viral genetic diversity. Using portable virus genome sequencing, we generated 59 ZIKV genomes in Manaus. Phylogenetic analyses indicated multiple introductions of ZIKV from northeastern Brazil to Manaus. Spatial genomic analysis of virus movement among six areas in Manaus suggested that populous northern neighborhoods acted as sources of virus transmission to other neighborhoods. Our study revealed how the ZIKV epidemic was ignited and maintained within the largest urban metropolis in the Amazon. These results might contribute to improving the public health response to outbreaks in Brazil.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular iron homeostasis is dominated by FBXL5-mediated degradation of iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), which is dependent on both iron and oxygen. However, how the physical interaction between FBXL5 and IRP2 is regulated remains elusive. Here, we show that the C-terminal substrate-binding domain of FBXL5 harbors a [2Fe2S] cluster in the oxidized state. A cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the IRP2-FBXL5-SKP1 complex reveals that the cluster organizes the FBXL5 C-terminal loop responsible for recruiting IRP2. Interestingly, IRP2 binding to FBXL5 hinges on the oxidized state of the [2Fe2S] cluster maintained by ambient oxygen, which could explain hypoxia-induced IRP2 stabilization. Steric incompatibility also allows FBXL5 to physically dislodge IRP2 from iron-responsive element RNA to facilitate its turnover. Taken together, our studies have identified an iron-sulfur cluster within FBXL5, which promotes IRP2 polyubiquitination and degradation in response to both iron and oxygen concentrations.

Abstract: Summary
Whereas folding of genomes at the large scale of epigenomic compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) is now relatively well understood, how chromatin is folded at finer scales remains largely unexplored in mammals. Here, we overcome some limitations of conventional 3C-based methods by using high-resolution Micro-C to probe links between 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation in mouse stem cells. Combinatorial binding of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers spatially segregates TAD regions into various finer-scale structures with distinct regulatory features including stripes, dots, and domains linking promoters-to-promoters (P-P) or enhancers-to-promoters (E-P) and bundle contacts between Polycomb regions. E-P stripes extending from the edge of domains predominantly link co-expressed loci, often in the absence of CTCF and cohesin occupancy. Acute inhibition of transcription disrupts these gene-related folding features without altering higher-order chromatin structures. Our study uncovers previously obscured finer-scale genome organization, establishing functional links between chromatin folding and gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Due to limited current therapies, metastases are the primary cause of mortality in cancer patients. Here, we employ a fusion compound of the cytokine LIGHT and a vascular targeting peptide (LIGHT-VTP) that homes to angiogenic blood vessels in primary tumors. We show in primary mouse lung cancer that normalization of tumor vasculature by LIGHT-VTP prevents cancer cell intravasation. Further, LIGHT-VTP efficiently targets pathological blood vessels in the pre-metastatic niche, reducing vascular hyper-permeability and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, thus blocking metastatic lung colonization. Moreover, we demonstrate that mouse and human metastatic melanoma deposits are targetable by VTP. In overt melanoma metastases, LIGHT-VTP normalizes intra-metastatic blood vessels and increases GrzB+ effector T cells. Successful treatment induces high endothelial venules (HEVs) and lymphocyte clusters, which sensitize refractory lung metastases to anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. These findings demonstrate an important application for LIGHT-VTP therapy in preventing metastatic development as well as exerting anti-tumor effects in established metastases.

Abstract: Summary
Heart regeneration requires cardiomyocyte proliferation. It is thought that formation of polyploid nuclei establishes a barrier for cardiomyocyte proliferation, but the mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that the nuclear lamina filament Lamin B2 (Lmnb2), whose expression decreases in mice after birth, is essential for nuclear envelope breakdown prior to progression to metaphase and subsequent division. Inactivating Lmnb2 decreased metaphase progression, which led to formation of polyploid cardiomyocyte nuclei in neonatal mice, which, in turn, decreased myocardial regeneration. Increasing Lmnb2 expression promoted cardiomyocyte M-phase progression and cytokinesis and improved indicators of myocardial regeneration in neonatal mice. Inactivating LMNB2 in human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes reduced karyokinesis and increased formation of polyploid nuclei. In primary cardiomyocytes from human infants with heart disease, modifying LMNB2 expression correspondingly altered metaphase progression and ploidy of daughter nuclei. In conclusion, Lmnb2 expression is essential for karyokinesis in mammalian cardiomyocytes and heart regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is one of the most acutely lethal toxins known to humans, and effective treatment for BoNT intoxication is urgently needed. Single-domain antibodies (VHH) have been examined as a countermeasure for BoNT because of their high stability and ease of production. Here, we investigate the structures and the neutralization mechanisms for six unique VHHs targeting BoNT/A1 or BoNT/B1. These studies reveal diverse neutralizing mechanisms by which VHHs prevent host receptor binding or block transmembrane delivery of the BoNT protease domain. Guided by this knowledge, we design heterodimeric VHHs by connecting two neutralizing VHHs via a flexible spacer so they can bind simultaneously to the toxin. These bifunctional VHHs display much greater potency in a mouse co-intoxication model than similar heterodimers unable to bind simultaneously. Taken together, our studies offer insight into antibody neutralization of BoNTs and advance our ability to design multivalent anti-pathogen VHHs with improved therapeutic properties.

Abstract: Currently, many available anti-cancer therapies are targeting apoptosis. However, many cancer cells have acquired resistance to apoptosis. To overcome this problem, simultaneous induction of other types of programmed cell death in addition to apoptosis of cancer cells might be an attractive strategy. For this purpose, we initially investigated the inhibitory role of TRIP-Br1/XIAP in necroptosis, a regulated form of necrosis, under nutrient/serum starvation. Our data showed that necroptosis was significantly induced in all tested 9 different types of cancer cell lines in response to prolonged serum starvation. Among them, necroptosis was induced at a relatively lower level in MCF-7 breast cancer line that was highly resistant to apoptosis than that in other cancer cell lines. Interestingly, TRIP-Br1 oncogenic protein level was found to be very high in this cell line. Up-regulated TRIP-Br1 suppressed necroptosis by repressing reactive oxygen species generation. Such suppression of necroptosis was greatly enhanced by XIAP, a potent inhibitor of apoptosis. Our data also showed that TRIP-Br1 increased XIAP phosphorylation at serine87, an active form of XIAP. Our mitochondrial fractionation data revealed that TRIP-Br1 protein level was greatly increased in the mitochondria upon serum starvation. It suppressed the export of CypD, a vital regulator in mitochondria-mediated necroptosis, from mitochondria to cytosol. TRIP-Br1 also suppressed shikonin-mediated necroptosis, but not TNF-α-mediated necroptosis, implying possible presence of another signaling pathway in necroptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that TRIP-Br1/XIAP can function as onco-proteins by suppressing necroptosis of cancer cells under nutrient/serum starvation.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer therapy is limited, in part, by lack of specificity. Thus, identifying molecules that are selectively expressed by, and relevant for, cancer cells is of paramount medical importance. Here, we show that peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) FK506-binding protein 10 (FKBP10)-positive cells are present in cancer lesions but absent in the healthy parenchyma of human lung. FKBP10 expression negatively correlates with survival of lung cancer patients, and its downregulation causes a dramatic diminution of lung tumor burden in mice. Mechanistically, our results from gain- and loss-of-function assays show that FKBP10 boosts cancer growth and stemness via its PPIase activity. Also, FKBP10 interacts with ribosomes, and its downregulation leads to reduction of translation elongation at the beginning of open reading frames (ORFs), particularly upon insertion of proline residues. Thus, our data unveil FKBP10 as a cancer-selective molecule with a key role in translational reprogramming, stem-like traits, and growth of lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Astroglia regulate neurovascular coupling while engaging in signal exchange with neurons. The underlying cellular machinery is thought to rely on astrocytic Ca2+ signals, but what controls their amplitude and waveform is poorly understood. Here, we employ time-resolved two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging in acute hippocampal slices and in cortex in vivo to find that resting [Ca2+] predicts the scale (amplitude) and the maximum (peak) of astroglial Ca2+ elevations. We bidirectionally manipulate resting [Ca2+] by uncaging intracellular Ca2+ or Ca2+ buffers and use ratiometric imaging of a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator to establish that alterations in resting [Ca2+] change co-directionally the peak level and anti-directionally the amplitude of local Ca2+ transients. This relationship holds for spontaneous and for induced (for instance by locomotion) Ca2+ signals. Our findings uncover a basic generic rule of Ca2+ signal formation in astrocytes, thus also associating the resting Ca2+ level with the physiological “excitability” state of astroglia.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted blockade of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), an immune-checkpoint receptor that inhibits T cell activation, provides clinical benefits in various cancers. However, how PD-1 modulates gene expression in T cells remains enigmatic. Here we investigated how PD-1 affects transcriptome changes induced by T cell receptor (TCR) activation. Intriguingly, we identified a huge variance in PD-1 sensitivity among TCR-inducible genes. When we quantified the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) as the relationship between change in gene expression and TCR signal strength, we found that genes associated with survival and proliferation were efficiently expressed upon TCR activation and resistant to PD-1-mediated inhibition. Conversely, genes encoding cytokines and effector molecules were expressed less efficiently and sensitive to PD-1-mediated inhibition. We further demonstrated that transcription factor binding motifs and CpG frequency in the promoter region affect EC50 and thus the PD-1 sensitivity of genes. Our findings explain how PD-1, dependent on the TCR signal strength, calibrates cellular transcriptomes to shape functional properties of T cell populations.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosolic caspase-8 is a mediator of death receptor signaling. While caspase-8 expression is lost in some tumors, it is increased in others, indicating a conditional pro-survival function of caspase-8 in cancer. Here, we show that tumor cells employ DNA-damage-induced nuclear caspase-8 to override the p53-dependent G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Caspase-8 is upregulated and localized to the nucleus in multiple human cancers, correlating with treatment resistance and poor clinical outcome. Depletion of caspase-8 causes G2/M arrest, stabilization of p53, and induction of p53-dependent intrinsic apoptosis in tumor cells. In the nucleus, caspase-8 cleaves and inactivates the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 28 (USP28), preventing USP28 from de-ubiquitinating and stabilizing wild-type p53. This results in de facto p53 protein loss, switching cell fate from apoptosis toward mitosis. In summary, our work identifies a non-canonical role of caspase-8 exploited by cancer cells to override the p53-dependent G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding of NAD+ metabolism provides many critical insights into health and diseases, yet highly sensitive and specific detection of NAD+ metabolism in live cells and in vivo remains difficult. Here, we present ratiometric, highly responsive genetically encoded fluorescent indicators, FiNad, for monitoring NAD+ dynamics in living cells and animals. FiNad sensors cover physiologically relevant NAD+ concentrations and sensitively respond to increases and decreases in NAD+. Utilizing FiNad, we performed a head-to-head comparison study of common NAD+ precursors in various organisms and mapped their biochemical roles in enhancing NAD+ levels. Moreover, we showed that increased NAD+ synthesis controls morphofunctional changes of activated macrophages, and directly imaged NAD+ declines during aging in situ. The broad utility of the FiNad sensors will expand our mechanistic understanding of numerous NAD+-associated physiological and pathological processes and facilitate screening for drug or gene candidates that affect uptake, efflux, and metabolism of this important cofactor.

Abstract: Summary
Deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) induces a hypermutator phenotype that can lead to tumorigenesis; however, the functional impact of the high mutation burden resulting from this phenotype remains poorly explored. Here, we demonstrate that dMMR-induced destabilizing mutations lead to proteome instability in dMMR tumors, resulting in an abundance of misfolded protein aggregates. To compensate, dMMR cells utilize a Nedd8-mediated degradation pathway to facilitate clearance of misfolded proteins. Blockade of this Nedd8 clearance pathway with MLN4924 causes accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates, ultimately inducing immunogenic cell death in dMMR cancer cells. To leverage this immunogenic cell death, we combined MLN4924 treatment with PD1 inhibition and found the combination was synergistic, significantly improving efficacy over either treatment alone.

Abstract: Summary
Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a prevalent form of lung cancer exhibiting distinctive histological and genetic characteristics. Chromosome 3q26 copy number gain (CNG) is a genetic hallmark of LSCC present in >90% of tumors. We report that 3q26 CNGs occur early in LSCC tumorigenesis, persist during tumor progression, and drive coordinate overexpression of PRKCI, SOX2, and ECT2. Overexpression of PRKCI, SOX2, and ECT2 in the context of Trp53 loss is sufficient to transform mouse lung basal stem cells into tumors with histological and genomic features of LSCC. Functionally, PRKCI and SOX2 collaborate to activate an extensive transcriptional program that enforces a lineage-restricted LSCC phenotype, whereas PRKCI and ECT2 collaborate to promote oncogenic growth. Gene signatures indicative of PKCι-SOX2 and PKCι-ECT2 signaling activity are enriched in the classical subtype of human LSCC and predict distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities. Thus, the PRKCI, SOX2, and ECT2 oncogenes represent a multigenic driver of LSCC.

Abstract: Summary
The functional impact of single interneurons on neuronal output in vivo and how interneurons are recruited by physiological activity patterns remain poorly understood. In the cerebellar cortex, molecular layer interneurons and their targets, Purkinje cells, receive excitatory inputs from granule cells and climbing fibers. Using dual patch-clamp recordings from interneurons and Purkinje cells in vivo, we probe the spatiotemporal interactions between these circuit elements. We show that single interneuron spikes can potently inhibit Purkinje cell output, depending on interneuron location. Climbing fiber input activates many interneurons via glutamate spillover but results in inhibition of those interneurons that inhibit the same Purkinje cell receiving the climbing fiber input, forming a disinhibitory motif. These interneuron circuits are engaged during sensory processing, creating diverse pathway-specific response functions. These findings demonstrate how the powerful effect of single interneurons on Purkinje cell output can be sculpted by various interneuron circuit motifs to diversify cerebellar computations.

Abstract: Summary
The La-related protein 7 (LARP7) forms a complex with the nuclear 7SK RNA to regulate RNA polymerase II transcription. It has been implicated in cancer and the Alazami syndrome, a severe developmental disorder. Here, we report a so far unknown role of this protein in RNA modification. We show that LARP7 physically connects the spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) with a distinct subset of box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) guiding U6 2′-O-methylation. Consistently, these modifications are severely compromised in the absence of LARP7. Although general splicing remains largely unaffected, transcriptome-wide analysis revealed perturbations in alternative splicing in LARP7-depleted cells. Importantly, we identified defects in 2′-O-methylation of the U6 snRNA in Alazami syndrome siblings carrying a LARP7 mutation. Our data identify LARP7 as a bridging factor for snoRNA-guided modification of the U6 snRNA and suggest that alterations in splicing fidelity contribute to the etiology of the Alazami syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
The striatum is a critical forebrain structure integrating cognitive, sensory, and motor information from diverse brain regions into meaningful behavioral output. However, the transcriptional mechanisms underlying striatal development at single-cell resolution remain unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we examine the cellular diversity of the early postnatal striatum and show that Foxp1, a transcription factor strongly linked to autism and intellectual disability, regulates the cellular composition, neurochemical architecture, and connectivity of the striatum in a cell-type-dependent fashion. We also identify Foxp1-regulated target genes within distinct cell types and connect these molecular changes to functional and behavioral deficits relevant to phenotypes described in patients with FOXP1 loss-of-function mutations. Using this approach, we could also examine the non-cell-autonomous effects produced by disrupting one cell type and the molecular compensation that occurs in other populations. These data reveal the cell-type-specific transcriptional mechanisms regulated by Foxp1 that underlie distinct features of striatal circuitry.

Abstract: Summary
Most adult neurons and glia originate from radial glial progenitors (RGs), a type of stem cell typically extending from the apical to the basal side of the developing cortex. Precise regulation of the choice between RG self-renewal and differentiation is critical for normal development, but the mechanisms underlying this transition remain elusive. We show that the non-canonical tubulin Tuba8, transiently expressed in cortical progenitors, drives differentiation of RGs into apical intermediate progenitors, a more restricted progenitor type lacking attachment to the basal lamina. This effect depends on the unique C-terminal sequence of Tuba8 that antagonizes tubulin tyrosination and Δ2 cleavage, two post-translational modifications (PTMs) essential for RG fiber maintenance and the switch between direct and indirect neurogenesis and ultimately distinct neuronal lineage outcomes. Our work uncovers an instructive role of a developmentally regulated tubulin isotype in progenitor differentiation and provides new insights into biological functions of the cellular tubulin PTM “code.”

Abstract: Summary
The centriole, or basal body, is the center of attachment between the sperm head and tail. While the distal end of the centriole templates the cilia, the proximal end associates with the nucleus. Using Drosophila, we identify a centriole-centric mechanism that ensures proper proximal end docking to the nucleus. This mechanism relies on the restriction of pericentrin-like protein (PLP) and the pericentriolar material (PCM) to the proximal end of the centriole. PLP is restricted proximally by limiting its mRNA and protein to the earliest stages of centriole elongation. Ectopic positioning of PLP to more distal portions of the centriole is sufficient to redistribute PCM and microtubules along the entire centriole length. This results in erroneous, lateral centriole docking to the nucleus, leading to spermatid decapitation as a result of a failure to form a stable head-tail linkage.

Abstract: Summary
Although autophagy is being pursued as a therapeutic target in clinical oncology trials, its effects on metastasis, the principal cause of cancer mortality, remain unclear. Here, we utilize mammary cancer models to temporally delete essential autophagy regulators during carcinoma progression. Though genetic ablation of autophagy strongly attenuates primary mammary tumor growth, impaired autophagy promotes spontaneous metastasis and enables the outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells into overt macro-metastases. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that autophagy deficiency elicits a subpopulation of otherwise luminal tumor cells exhibiting basal differentiation traits, which is reversed upon preventing accumulation of the autophagy cargo receptor, Neighbor to BRCA1 (NBR1). Furthermore, pharmacological and genetic induction of autophagy suppresses pro-metastatic differentiation and metastatic outgrowth. Analysis of human breast cancer data reveal that autophagy gene expression inversely correlates with pro-metastatic differentiation signatures and predicts overall and distant metastasis-free survival. Overall, these findings highlight autophagy-dependent control of NBR1 as a key determinant of metastatic progression.

Abstract: Summary
It has been long assumed that normally leading strand synthesis must proceed coordinated with the lagging strand to prevent strand uncoupling and the pathological accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the cell, a dogma recently challenged by in vitro studies in prokaryotes. Here, we report that human DNA polymerases can function independently at each strand in vivo and that the resulting strand uncoupling is supported physiologically by a cellular tolerance to ssDNA. Active forks rapidly accumulate ssDNA at the lagging strand when POLA1 is inhibited without triggering a stress response, despite ssDNA formation being considered a hallmark of replication stress. Acute POLA1 inhibition causes a lethal RPA exhaustion, but cells can duplicate their DNA with limited POLA1 activity and exacerbated strand uncoupling as long as RPA molecules suffice to protect the elevated ssDNA. Although robust, this uncoupled mode of DNA replication is also an in-built weakness that can be targeted for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Over the past decade, 3C-related methods have provided remarkable insights into chromosome folding in vivo. To overcome the limited resolution of prior studies, we extend a recently developed Hi-C variant, Micro-C, to map chromosome architecture at nucleosome resolution in human ESCs and fibroblasts. Micro-C robustly captures known features of chromosome folding including compartment organization, topologically associating domains, and interactions between CTCF binding sites. In addition, Micro-C provides a detailed map of nucleosome positions and localizes contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal precision. Compared to Hi-C, Micro-C exhibits an order of magnitude greater dynamic range, allowing the identification of ∼20,000 additional loops in each cell type. Many newly identified peaks are localized along extrusion stripes and form transitive grids, consistent with their anchors being pause sites impeding cohesin-dependent loop extrusion. Our analyses comprise the highest-resolution maps of chromosome folding in human cells to date, providing a valuable resource for studies of chromosome organization.

Abstract: Na/Ca exchange is the dominant calcium (Ca) efflux mechanism in cardiac myocytes. Although our knowledge of exchanger function (NCX1 in the heart) was originally established using biochemical and electrophysiological tools such as cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles and the giant patch technique [[1], [2], [3], [4]], many advances in our understanding of the physiological/pathophysiological roles of NCX1 in the heart have been obtained using a suite of genetically modified mice. Early mouse studies focused on modification of expression levels of NCX1 in the ventricles, with transgenic overexpressors, global NCX1 knockout (KO) mice (which were embryonic lethal if homozygous), and finally ventricular-specific NCX1 KO [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. We found, to our surprise, that ventricular cardiomyocytes lacking NCX1 can survive and function by engaging a clever set of adaptations to minimize Ca entry, while maintaining contractile function through an increase in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling gain [5,6,13]. Having studied ventricular NCX1 ablation in detail, we more recently focused on elucidating the role of NCX1 in the atria through altering NCX1 expression. Using a novel atrial-specific NCX1 KO mouse, we found unexpected changes in atrial cell morphology and calcium handling, together with dramatic alterations in the function of sinoatrial node (SAN) pacemaker activity. In this review, we will discuss these findings and their implications for cardiac disease.

Abstract: The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation (or SUMOylation) is a post-translational protein modification mechanism activated by different stress conditions that has been recently investigated in experimental models of cerebral ischemia. The expression of SUMOylation enzymes and substrates is not restricted to the nucleus, since they are present also in the cytoplasm and on plasma membrane and are involved in several physiological and pathological conditions. In the last decades, convincing evidence have supported the idea that the increased levels of SUMOylated proteins may induce tolerance to ischemic stress. In particular, it has been established that protein SUMOylation may confer neuroprotection during ischemic preconditioning. Considering the increasing evidence that SUMO can modify stability and expression of ion channels and transporters and the relevance of controlling ionic homeostasis in ischemic conditions, the present review will resume the main aspects of SUMO pathways related to the key molecules involved in maintenance of ionic homeostasis during cerebral ischemia and ischemic preconditioning, with a particular focus on the on Na+/Ca2+ exchangers.

Abstract: Summary
Biofluids contain various circulating cell-free RNAs (ccfRNAs). The composition of these ccfRNAs varies among biofluids. They constitute tantalizing biomarker candidates for several pathologies and have been demonstrated to be mediators of cellular communication. Little is known about their function in physiological and developmental settings, and most works are limited to in vitro studies. Here, we develop iTAG-RNA, a method for the unbiased tagging of RNA transcripts in mice in vivo. We use iTAG-RNA to isolate hepatocytes and kidney proximal epithelial cell-specific transcriptional responses to a dietary challenge without interfering with the tissue architecture and to identify multiple hepatocyte-secreted ccfRNAs in plasma. We also identify specific transfer of liver-derived ccfRNAs to adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, where they likely constitute a buffering system to maintain lipid homeostasis under acute high-fat-diet feeding. Our findings directly demonstrate in vivo transfer of RNAs between tissues and highlight its implications for endocrine signaling and homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Cells deficient in ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and other anti-cancer agents that induce double-strand DNA breaks. ATM inhibitors may therefore sensitize cancer cells to these agents. Some cancers may also have underlying genetic defects predisposing them to an ATM inhibitor monotherapy response. We have conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genetic vulnerabilities that sensitize lung cancer cells to ATM inhibitors. Knockout of genes in the Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway results in hypersensitivity to the ATM inhibitor M3541. Knockdown of either an FA gene or of ATM results in reduced double-strand break end resection, enhanced non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair, and decreased homologous recombination repair. Knockout of both the FA/BRCA pathway and ATM strongly inhibits end resection and generates toxic levels of NHEJ, thereby elucidating a mechanism of cellular death by synthetic lethality. ATM inhibitors may therefore be useful for the treatment of tumors with a defective FA/BRCA pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The resolution phase of acute inflammation is essential for tissue homeostasis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We demonstrate that resolution of inflammation involves interactions between CD38 and tristetraprolin (TTP). During the onset of acute inflammation, CD38 levels are increased, leading to the production of Ca2+-signaling messengers, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), ADP ribose (ADPR), and cyclic ADPR (cADPR) from NAD(P)+. To initiate the onset of resolution, TTP expression is increased by the second messengers, NAADP and cADPR, which downregulate CD38 expression. The activation of TTP by Sirt1-dependent deacetylation, in response to increased NAD+ levels, suppresses the acute inflammatory response and decreases Rheb expression, inhibits mTORC1, and induces autophagolysosomes for bacterial clearance. TTP may represent a mechanistic target of anti-inflammatory agents, such as carbon monoxide. TTP mediates crosstalk between acute inflammation and autophagic clearance of bacteria from damaged tissue in the resolution of inflammation during sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) form a road-like cellular network in lymph nodes (LNs) that provides essential chemotactic, survival, and regulatory signals for immune cells. While the topological characteristics of the FRC network have been elaborated, the network properties of the micro-tubular conduit system generated by FRCs, which drains lymph fluid through a pipeline-like system to distribute small molecules and antigens, has remained unexplored. Here, we quantify the crucial 3D morphometric parameters and determine the topological properties governing the structural organization of the intertwined networks. We find that the conduit system exhibits lesser small-worldness and lower resilience to perturbation compared to the FRC network, while the robust topological organization of both networks is maintained in a lymphotoxin-β-receptor-independent manner. Overall, the high-resolution topological analysis of the “roads-and-pipes” networks highlights essential parameters underlying the functional organization of LN micro-environments and will, hence, advance the development of multi-scale LN models.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is now the first choice to determine the high-resolution structures of huge protein complexes. Grids with two-dimensional arrays of holes covered with a carbon film are typically used in cryo-EM. Although semi-automatic plungers are available, notable trial-and-error is still required to obtain a suitable grid specimen. Herein, we introduce a new method to obtain thin ice specimens using real-time measurement of the liquid amounts in cryo-EM grids. The grids for cryo-EM strongly diffracted laser light, and the diffraction intensity of each spot was measurable in real-time. The measured diffraction patterns represented the states of the liquid in the holes due to the curvature of the liquid around them. Using the diffraction patterns, the optimal time point for freezing the grids for cryo-EM was obtained in real-time. This development will help researchers rapidly determine high-resolution protein structures using the limited resource of cryo-EM instrument access.

Abstract: Summary
Induction of lung regeneration by transplantation of lung progenitor cells is a critical preclinical challenge. Recently, we demonstrated that robust lung regeneration can be achieved if the endogenous stem cell niches in the recipient’s lung are vacated by sub-lethal pre-conditioning. However, overcoming MHC barriers is an additional requirement for clinical application of this attractive approach. We demonstrate here that durable tolerance toward mis-matched lung progenitors and their derivatives can be achieved without any chronic immune suppression, by virtue of co-transplantation with hematopoietic progenitors from the same donor. Initial proof of concept of this approach was attained by transplantation of fetal lung cells comprising both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic progenitors. Furthermore, an even higher rate of blood and epithelial lung chimerism was attained by using adult lung cells supplemented with bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors. These results lay the foundation for repair of lung injury through a procedure akin to bone marrow transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) is generally paused at promoter-proximal regions in most metazoans, and based on in vitro studies, this function has been attributed to the negative elongation factor (NELF). Here, we show that upon rapid depletion of NELF, RNA Pol II fails to be released into gene bodies, stopping instead around the +1 nucleosomal dyad-associated region. The transition to the 2nd pause region is independent of positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb. During the heat shock response, RNA Pol II is rapidly released from pausing at heat shock-induced genes, while most genes are paused and transcriptionally downregulated. Both of these aspects of the heat shock response remain intact upon NELF loss. We find that NELF depletion results in global loss of cap-binding complex from chromatin without global reduction of nascent transcript 5′ cap stability. Thus, our studies implicate NELF functioning in early elongation complexes distinct from RNA Pol II pause-release.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac ischemia leads to the loss of myocardial tissue and the activation of a repair process that culminates in the formation of a scar whose structural characteristics dictate propensity to favorable healing or detrimental cardiac wall rupture. To elucidate the cellular processes underlying scar formation, here we perform unbiased single-cell mRNA sequencing of interstitial cells isolated from infarcted mouse hearts carrying a genetic tracer that labels epicardial-derived cells. Sixteen interstitial cell clusters are revealed, five of which were of epicardial origin. Focusing on stromal cells, we define 11 sub-clusters, including diverse cell states of epicardial- and endocardial-derived fibroblasts. Comparing transcript profiles from post-infarction hearts in C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ inbred mice, which displays a marked divergence in the frequency of cardiac rupture, uncovers an early increase in activated myofibroblasts, enhanced collagen deposition, and persistent acute phase response in 129S1/SvImJ mouse hearts, defining a crucial time window of pathological remodeling that predicts disease outcome.

Abstract: Summary
Co-opting Cullin4 RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL4s) to inducibly degrade pathogenic proteins is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy. Despite intense efforts to rationally design degrader molecules that co-opt CRL4s, much about the organization and regulation of these ligases remains elusive. Here, we establish protein interaction kinetics and estimation of stoichiometries (PIKES) analysis, a systematic proteomic profiling platform that integrates cellular engineering, affinity purification, chemical stabilization, and quantitative mass spectrometry to investigate the dynamics of interchangeable multiprotein complexes. Using PIKES, we show that ligase assemblies of Cullin4 with individual substrate receptors differ in abundance by up to 200-fold and that Cand1/2 act as substrate receptor exchange factors. Furthermore, degrader molecules can induce the assembly of their cognate CRL4, and higher expression of the associated substrate receptor enhances degrader potency. Beyond the CRL4 network, we show how PIKES can reveal systems level biochemistry for cellular protein networks important to drug development.
