Abstract: Summary
Activation of the innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is key to generate lasting adaptive immunity. PRRs detect unique chemical patterns associated with invading microorganisms, but whether and how the physical properties of PRR ligands influence the development of the immune response remains unknown. Through the study of fungal mannans, we show that the physical form of PRR ligands dictates the immune response. Soluble mannans are immunosilent in the periphery but elicit a potent pro-inflammatory response in the draining lymph node (dLN). By modulating the physical form of mannans, we developed a formulation that targets both the periphery and the dLN. When combined with viral glycoprotein antigens, this mannan formulation broadens epitope recognition, elicits potent antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies, and confers protection against viral infections of the lung. Thus, the physical properties of microbial ligands determine the outcome of the immune response and can be harnessed for vaccine development.

Abstract: Summary
The high turnover and regenerative capacity of the adult intestine relies on resident stem cells located at the bottom of the crypt. The enteric nervous system consists of an abundant network of enteric glial cells (EGCs) and neurons. Despite the close proximity of EGCs to stem cells, their in vivo role as a stem cell niche is still unclear. By analyzing the mouse and human intestinal mucosa transcriptomes at the single-cell level, we defined the regulation of EGC heterogeneity in homeostasis and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Ablation of EGC subpopulations revealed that the repair potential of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) is regulated by a specific subset of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ EGCs. Mechanistically, injury induces expansion of GFAP+ EGCs, which express several WNT ligands to promote LGR5+ ISC self-renewal. Our work reveals the dynamically regulated heterogeneity of EGCs as a key part of the intestinal stem cell niche in regeneration and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the abundance of capillary thin-strand pericytes and their proximity to neurons and glia, little is known of the contributions of these cells to the control of brain hemodynamics. We demonstrate that the pharmacological activation of thin-strand pericyte KATP channels profoundly hyperpolarizes these cells, dilates upstream penetrating arterioles and arteriole-proximate capillaries, and increases capillary blood flow. Focal stimulation of pericytes with a KATP channel agonist is sufficient to evoke this response, mediated via KIR2.1 channel-dependent retrograde propagation of hyperpolarizing signals, whereas genetic inactivation of pericyte KATP channels eliminates these effects. Critically, we show that decreasing extracellular glucose to less than 1 mM or inhibiting glucose uptake by blocking GLUT1 transporters in vivo flips a mechanistic energy switch driving rapid KATP-mediated pericyte hyperpolarization to increase local blood flow. Together, our findings recast capillary pericytes as metabolic sentinels that respond to local energy deficits by increasing blood flow to neurons to prevent energetic shortfalls.

Abstract: Summary
Heightened wakefulness in response to stressors is essential for survival but can also lead to sleep disorders like insomnia. The paraventricular thalamus (PVT) is both a critical thalamic area for wakefulness and a stress-sensitive brain region. However, whether the PVT and its neural circuitries are involved in controlling wakefulness in stress conditions remains unknown. Here, we find that PVT neurons projecting to the central amygdala (CeA) are activated by different stressors. These neurons are wakefulness-active and increase their activities upon sleep to wakefulness transitions. Optogenetic activation of the PVT-CeA circuit evokes transitions from sleep to wakefulness, whereas selectively silencing the activity of this circuit decreases time spent in wakefulness. Specifically, chemogenetic inhibition of CeA-projecting PVT neurons not only alleviates stress responses but also attenuates the acute stress-induced increase of wakefulness. Thus, our results demonstrate that the PVT-CeA circuit controls physiological wakefulness and modulates acute stress-induced heightened wakefulness.

Abstract: Summary
Down syndrome (DS), the genetic condition caused by trisomy 21 (T21), is characterized by stunted growth, cognitive impairment, and increased risk of diverse neurological conditions. Although signs of lifelong neurodegeneration are well documented in DS, the mechanisms underlying this phenotype await elucidation. Here we report a multi-omics analysis of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation biomarkers, plasma proteomics, and immune profiling in a diverse cohort of more than 400 research participants. We identified depletion of insulin growth factor 1 (IGF1), a master regulator of growth and brain development, as the top biosignature associated with neurodegeneration in DS. Individuals with T21 display chronic IGF1 deficiency downstream of growth hormone production, associated with a specific inflammatory profile involving elevated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Shorter children with DS show stronger IGF1 deficiency, elevated biomarkers of neurodegeneration, and increased prevalence of autism and other conditions. These results point to disruption of IGF1 signaling as a potential contributor to stunted growth and neurodegeneration in DS.

Abstract: Summary
During heart maturation, gap junctions assemble into hemichannels and polarize to the intercalated disc at cell borders to mediate electrical impulse conduction. However, the molecular mechanism underpinning cardiac gap junction assembly remains elusive. Herein, we demonstrate an important role for the deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD) in this process. Depletion of CYLD in mice impairs the formation of cardiac gap junctions, accelerates cardiac fibrosis, and increases heart failure. Mechanistically, CYLD interacts with plakoglobin and removes lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from plakoglobin. The deubiquitination of plakoglobin enhances its interaction with the desmoplakin/end-binding protein 1 complex localized at the microtubule plus end, thereby promoting microtubule-dependent transport of connexin 43 (Cx43), a key component of gap junctions, to the cell membrane. These findings establish CYLD as a critical player in regulating gap junction assembly and have important implications in heart development and diseases.

Abstract: Summary
α-Synuclein (α-syn) is important in synucleinopathies such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). While genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of synucleinopathies have identified many risk loci, the underlying genes have not been shown for most loci. Using Drosophila, we screened 3,471 mutant chromosomes for genetic modifiers of α-synuclein and identified 12 genes. Eleven modifiers have human orthologs associated with diseases, including MED13 and CDC27, which lie within PD GWAS loci. Drosophila Skd/Med13 and glycolytic enzymes are co-upregulated by α-syn-associated neurodegeneration. While elevated α-syn compromises mitochondrial function, co-expressing skd/Med13 RNAi and α-syn synergistically increase the ratio of oxidized-to-reduced glutathione. The resulting neurodegeneration can be suppressed by overexpressing a glycolytic enzyme or treatment with deferoxamine, suggesting that compensatory glycolysis is neuroprotective. In addition, the functional relationship between α-synuclein, MED13, and glycolytic enzymes is conserved between flies and mice. We propose that hypoxia-inducible factor and MED13 are part of a druggable pathway for PD.

Abstract: Summary
The use of an integrated systems biology approach to investigate tissues and organs has been thought to be impracticable in the field of structural biology, where the techniques mainly focus on determining the structure of a particular biomacromolecule of interest. Here, we report the use of cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to define the composition of a raw bovine retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lysate. From this sample, we simultaneously identify and solve cryo-EM structures of seven different RPE enzymes whose functions affect neurotransmitter recycling, iron metabolism, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, axonal development, and energy homeostasis. Interestingly, dysfunction of these important proteins has been directly linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophrenia. Our work underscores the importance of cryo-EM in facilitating tissue and organ proteomics at the atomic level.

Abstract: Aging is a major risk factor for common neurodegenerative diseases. Although multiple molecular, cellular, structural, and functional changes occur in the brain during aging, the involvement of caveolin-2 (Cav-2) in brain ageing remains unknown. We investigated Cav-2 expression in brains of aged mice and its effects on endothelial cells. The human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) showed decreased THP-1 adhesion and infiltration when treated with Cav-2 siRNA compared to control siRNA. In contrast, Cav-2 overexpression increased THP-1 adhesion and infiltration in HUVECs. Increased expression of Cav-2 and iba-1 was observed in brains of old mice. Moreover, there were fewer iba-1–positive cells in the brains of aged Cav-2 knockout (KO) mice than of wild-type aged mice. The levels of several chemokines were higher in brains of aged wild-type mice than in young wild-type mice; moreover, chemokine levels were significantly lower in brains of young mice as well as aged Cav-2 KO mice than in their wild-type counterparts. Expression of PECAM1 and VE-cadherin proteins increased in brains of old wild-type mice but was barely detected in brains of young wild-type and Cav-2 KO mice. Collectively, our results suggest that Cav-2 expression increases in the endothelial cells of aged brain, and promotes leukocyte infiltration and age-associated neuroinflammation.

Abstract: Summary
An outbreak of over 1,000 COVID-19 cases in Provincetown, Massachusetts (MA), in July 2021—the first large outbreak mostly in vaccinated individuals in the US—prompted a comprehensive public health response, motivating changes to national masking recommendations and raising questions about infection and transmission among vaccinated individuals. To address these questions, we combined viral genomic and epidemiological data from 467 individuals, including 40% of outbreak-associated cases. The Delta variant accounted for 99% of cases in this dataset; it was introduced from at least 40 sources, but 83% of cases derived from a single source, likely through transmission across multiple settings over a short time rather than a single event. Genomic and epidemiological data supported multiple transmissions of Delta from and between fully vaccinated individuals. However, despite its magnitude, the outbreak had limited onward impact in MA and the US overall, likely due to high vaccination rates and a robust public health response.

Abstract: Summary
While the distant organ environment is known to support metastasis of primary tumors, its metabolic roles in this process remain underdetermined. Here, in breast cancer models, we found lung-resident mesenchymal cells (MCs) accumulating neutral lipids at the pre-metastatic stage. This was partially mediated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA) that subsequently represses adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) activity in lung MCs. MC-specific ablation of the ATGL or HILPDA genes in mice reinforced and reduced lung metastasis of breast cancer respectively, suggesting a metastasis-promoting effect of lipid-laden MCs. Mechanistically, lipid-laden MCs transported their lipids to tumor cells and natural killer (NK) cells via exosome-like vesicles, leading to heightened tumor cell survival and proliferation and NK cell dysfunction. Blockage of IL-1β, which was effective singly, improved the efficacy of adoptive NK cell immunotherapy in mitigating lung metastasis. Collectively, lung MCs metabolically regulate tumor cells and anti-tumor immunity to facilitate breast cancer lung metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Two HIV fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides (LP-97 and LP-98) were designed with highly potent, long-acting antiviral activity. Monotherapy using a low dose of LP-98 sharply reduced viral loads and maintained long-term viral suppression in 21 SHIVSF162P3-infected rhesus macaques. We found that five treated monkeys achieved potential posttreatment control (PTC) efficacy and had lower viral DNA in deep lymph nodes, whereas monkeys with a stable viral rebound had higher viral DNA in superficial lymph nodes. The tissues of PTC monkeys exhibited significantly decreased quantitative viral outgrowth and fewer PD-1+ central memory CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells contributed to virologic control efficacy. Moreover, LP-98 administrated as a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provided complete protection against SHIVSF162P3 and SIVmac239 infections in 51 monkeys via intrarectal, intravaginal, or intravenous challenge. In conclusion, our lipopeptides exhibit high potential as an efficient HIV treatment or prevention strategy.

Abstract: Summary
We report that cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and mesenchymal progenitors are more hypoxic than other cardiac interstitial populations, express more hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), and exhibit increased glycolytic metabolism. CF-specific deletion of Hif-1a resulted in decreased HIF-1 target gene expression and increased mesenchymal progenitors in uninjured hearts and increased CF activation without proliferation following sham injury, as demonstrated using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). After myocardial infarction (MI), however, there was ∼50% increased CF proliferation and excessive scarring and contractile dysfunction, a scenario replicated in 3D engineered cardiac microtissues. CF proliferation was associated with higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) as occurred also in wild-type mice treated with the mitochondrial ROS generator MitoParaquat (MitoPQ). The mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO rescued Hif-1a mutant phenotypes. Thus, HIF-1α in CFs provides a critical braking mechanism against excessive post-ischemic CF activation and proliferation through regulation of mitochondrial ROS. CFs are potential cellular targets for designer antioxidant therapies in cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Summary
Sorting transmembrane cargo is essential for tissue development and homeostasis. However, mechanisms of intracellular trafficking in stratified epidermis are poorly understood. Here, we identify an interaction between the retromer endosomal trafficking component, VPS35, and the desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein-1 (Dsg1). Dsg1 is specifically expressed in stratified epidermis and, when properly localized on the plasma membrane of basal keratinocytes, promotes stratification. We show that the retromer drives Dsg1 recycling from the endo-lysosomal system to the plasma membrane to support human keratinocyte stratification. The retromer-enhancing chaperone, R55, promotes the membrane localization of Dsg1 and a trafficking-deficient mutant associated with a severe inflammatory skin disorder, enhancing its ability to promote stratification. In the absence of Dsg1, retromer association with and expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 increases, exposing a potential link between Dsg1 deficiency and epidermal metabolism. Our work provides evidence for retromer function in epidermal regeneration, identifying it as a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
The hypothalamus comprises various nuclei and neuronal subpopulations that control fundamental homeostasis and behaviors. However, spatiotemporal molecular characterization of hypothalamus development in humans is largely unexplored. Here, we revealed spatiotemporal transcriptome profiles and cell-type characteristics of human hypothalamus development and illustrated the molecular diversity of neural progenitors and the cell-fate decision, which is programmed by a combination of transcription factors. Different neuronal and glial fates are sequentially produced and showed spatial developmental asynchrony. Moreover, human hypothalamic gliogenesis occurs at an earlier stage of gestation and displays distinctive transcription profiles compared with those in mouse. Notably, early oligodendrocyte cells in humans exhibit different gene patterns and interact with neuronal cells to regulate neuronal maturation by Wnt, Hippo, and integrin signals. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive molecular landscape of human hypothalamus development at early- and mid-embryonic stages and a foundation for understanding its spatial and functional complexity.

Abstract: Summary
Small molecule chaperones have been exploited as therapeutics for the hundreds of diseases caused by protein misfolding. The most successful examples are the CFTR correctors, which transformed cystic fibrosis therapy. These molecules revert folding defects of the ΔF508 mutant and are widely used to treat patients. To investigate the molecular mechanism of their action, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of CFTR in complex with the FDA-approved correctors lumacaftor or tezacaftor. Both drugs insert into a hydrophobic pocket in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), linking together four helices that are thermodynamically unstable. Mutating residues at the binding site rendered ΔF508-CFTR insensitive to lumacaftor and tezacaftor, underscoring the functional significance of the structural discovery. These results support a mechanism in which the correctors stabilize TMD1 at an early stage of biogenesis, prevent its premature degradation, and thereby allosterically rescuing many disease-causing mutations.

The analysis of 1,264 clinical cases of liver failure (LF) showed that the incidence of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia in patients with LF is 5.5% and 20%, respectively. Metabolomic studies indicate that glutathione (GSH)-deficiency-caused ferroptosis contributes to pancreatic damage in mouse ALF. β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) is the only metabolite downregulated in the liver, serum, and pancreas. Our data suggest that β-HB protects pancreatic cells and tissues from GSH-deficiency-caused ferroptosis. β-HB administration in ALF mice restores the expression of ferroptosis-suppressor genes through histone H3 lysine 9 β-hydroxybutyrylation (H3K9bhb)-mediated chromatin opening. Our findings highlight β-HB as an endogenous metabolite regulating ferroptosis in the pancreas and extend our understanding of the pathophysiology of ALF-induced pancreatitis.

Abstract: Summary
Treatment of severe COVID-19 is currently limited by clinical heterogeneity and incomplete description of specific immune biomarkers. We present here a comprehensive multi-omic blood atlas for patients with varying COVID-19 severity in an integrated comparison with influenza and sepsis patients versus healthy volunteers. We identify immune signatures and correlates of host response. Hallmarks of disease severity involved cells, their inflammatory mediators and networks, including progenitor cells and specific myeloid and lymphocyte subsets, features of the immune repertoire, acute phase response, metabolism, and coagulation. Persisting immune activation involving AP-1/p38MAPK was a specific feature of COVID-19. The plasma proteome enabled sub-phenotyping into patient clusters, predictive of severity and outcome. Systems-based integrative analyses including tensor and matrix decomposition of all modalities revealed feature groupings linked with severity and specificity compared to influenza and sepsis. Our approach and blood atlas will support future drug development, clinical trial design, and personalized medicine approaches for COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Pneumolysin is a major virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae that plays a key role in interaction with the host during invasive disease. How pneumolysin influences these dynamics between host and pathogen interaction during early phase of central nervous system infection in pneumococcal meningitis remains unclear. Using a whole-animal in vivo dual RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach, we identify pneumolysin-specific transcriptional responses in both S. pneumoniae and zebrafish (Danio rerio) during early pneumococcal meningitis. By functional enrichment analysis, we identify host pathways known to be activated by pneumolysin and discover the importance of necroptosis for host survival. Inhibition of this pathway using the drug GSK′872 increases host mortality during pneumococcal meningitis. On the pathogen’s side, we show that pneumolysin-dependent competence activation is crucial for intra-host replication and virulence. Altogether, this study provides new insights into pneumolysin-specific transcriptional responses and identifies key pathways involved in pneumococcal meningitis.

Abstract: Summary
Gasdermins are a family of structurally related proteins originally described for their role in pyroptosis. Gasdermin B (GSDMB) is currently the least studied, and while its association with genetic susceptibility to chronic mucosal inflammatory disorders is well established, little is known about its functional relevance during active disease states. Herein, we report increased GSDMB in inflammatory bowel disease, with single-cell analysis identifying epithelial specificity to inflamed colonocytes/crypt top colonocytes. Surprisingly, mechanistic experiments and transcriptome profiling reveal lack of inherent GSDMB-dependent pyroptosis in activated epithelial cells and organoids but instead point to increased proliferation and migration during in vitro wound closure, which arrests in GSDMB-deficient cells that display hyper-adhesiveness and enhanced formation of vinculin-based focal adhesions dependent on PDGF-A-mediated FAK phosphorylation. Importantly, carriage of disease-associated GSDMB SNPs confers functional defects, disrupting epithelial restitution/repair, which, altogether, establishes GSDMB as a critical factor for restoration of epithelial barrier function and the resolution of inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
The hippocampus receives glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs from subcortical regions. Despite the important roles of these subcortical inputs in the regulation of hippocampal circuit, it has not been explored whether associative activation of the subcorticohippocampal pathway induces Hebbian plasticity of subcortical inputs. Here, we demonstrate that the hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) to the dentate granule cell (GC) synapses, which co-release glutamate and GABA, undergo associative long-term potentiation (LTP) of glutamatergic, but not GABAergic, co-transmission. This LTP is induced by pairing of SuM inputs with GC spikes. We found that this Hebbian LTP is input-specific, requires NMDA receptors and CaMKII activation, and is expressed postsynaptically. By the net increase in excitatory drive of SuM inputs following LTP induction, associative inputs of SuM and the perforant path effectively discharge GCs. Our results highlight the important role of associative plasticity at SuM-GC synapses in the regulation of dentate gyrus activity and for the encoding of SuM-related information.

Abstract: Summary
Multiciliated ependymal cells and adult neural stem cells are components of the adult neurogenic niche, essential for brain homeostasis. These cells share a common glial cell lineage regulated by the Geminin family members Geminin and GemC1/Mcidas. Ependymal precursors require GemC1/Mcidas expression to massively amplify centrioles and become multiciliated cells. Here, we show that GemC1-dependent differentiation is initiated in actively cycling radial glial cells, in which a DNA damage response, including DNA replication-associated damage and dysfunctional telomeres, is induced, without affecting cell survival. Genotoxic stress is not sufficient by itself to induce ependymal cell differentiation, although the absence of p53 or p21 in progenitors hinders differentiation by maintaining cell division. Activation of the p53-p21 pathway downstream of GemC1 leads to cell-cycle slowdown/arrest, which permits timely onset of ependymal cell differentiation in progenitor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Adult stem cells maintain regenerative tissue structure and function by producing tissue-specific progeny, but the factors that preserve their tissue identities are not well understood. The small and large intestines differ markedly in cell composition and function, reflecting their distinct stem cell populations. Here we show that SATB2, a colon-restricted chromatin factor, singularly preserves LGR5+ adult colonic stem cell and epithelial identity in mice and humans. Satb2 loss in adult mice leads to stable conversion of colonic stem cells into small intestine ileal-like stem cells and replacement of the colonic mucosa with one that resembles the ileum. Conversely, SATB2 confers colonic properties on the mouse ileum. Human colonic organoids also adopt ileal characteristics upon SATB2 loss. SATB2 regulates colonic identity in part by modulating enhancer binding of the intestinal transcription factors CDX2 and HNF4A. Our study uncovers a conserved core regulator of colonic stem cells able to mediate cross-tissue plasticity in mature intestines.

Abstract: Summary
Precision oncology relies on the accurate molecular characterization of individual patients with cancer at the time of treatment initiation. However, tumor molecular profiles are not static, and cancers continually evolve because of ongoing mutagenesis and clonal selection. Here, we performed genomic analyses of primary tumors, metastases, and plasma collected from individual patients to define the concordance of actionable genomic alterations and to identify drivers of metastatic disease progression. We observed a high degree of discordance of actionable genomic alterations, with 23% discordant between primary and metastatic disease sites. Among chromatin-modifying genes, ARID1A mutations, when discordant, were exclusive to the metastatic tumor samples. Our findings indicate that the high degree of lesion-to-lesion genomic heterogeneity may be a barrier to precision oncology approaches for bladder cancer and that circulating tumor DNA profiling may be preferred to tumor sequencing for a subset of patients.

Abstract: Summary
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues worldwide with many variants arising, some of which are variants of concern (VOCs). A recent VOC, omicron (B.1.1.529), which obtains a large number of mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, has risen to intense scientific and public attention. Here, we studied the binding properties between the human receptor ACE2 (hACE2) and the VOC RBDs and resolved the crystal and cryoelectron microscopy structures of the omicron RBD-hACE2 complex as well as the crystal structure of the delta RBD-hACE2 complex. We found that, unlike alpha, beta, and gamma, omicron RBD binds to hACE2 at a similar affinity to that of the prototype RBD, which might be due to compensation of multiple mutations for both immune escape and transmissibility. The complex structures of omicron RBD-hACE2 and delta RBD-hACE2 reveal the structural basis of how RBD-specific mutations bind to hACE2.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant activation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is usually a result of mutation and plays important roles in tumorigenesis. How RTK without mutation affects tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. Here we show that in human melanomas pro-prion (pro-PrP) is an adaptor protein for an E3 ligase c-Cbl, enabling it to polyubiquitinate activated insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), leading to enhanced melanoma metastasis. All human melanoma cell lines studied here express pro-PrP, retaining its glycosylphosphatidylinositol-peptide signal sequence (GPI-PSS). The sequence, PVILLISFLI in the GPI-PSS of pro-PrP, binds c-Cbl, docking c-Cbl to the inner cell membrane, forming a pro-PrP/c-Cbl/IGF-1R trimeric complex. Subsequently, IGF-1R polyubiquitination and degradation are augmented, which increases autophagy and tumor metastasis. Importantly, the synthetic peptide PVILLISFLI disrupts the pro-PrP/c-Cbl/IGF-1R complex, reducing cancer cell autophagy and mitigating tumor aggressiveness in vitro and in vivo. Targeting cancer-associated GPI-PSS may provide a therapeutic approach for treating human cancers expressing pro-PrP.

Abstract: Summary
When challenged with an invading pathogen, the host-defense response is engaged to eliminate the pathogen (resistance) and to maintain health in the presence of the pathogen (disease tolerance). However, the identification of distinct molecular programs underpinning disease tolerance and resistance remained obscure. We exploited transcriptional and physiological monitoring across 33 mouse strains, during in vivo influenza virus infection, to identify two host-defense gene programs—one is associated with hallmarks of disease tolerance and the other with hallmarks of resistance. Both programs constitute generic responses in multiple mouse and human cell types. Our study describes the organizational principles of these programs and validates Arhgdia as a regulator of disease-tolerance states in epithelial cells. We further reveal that the baseline disease-tolerance state in peritoneal macrophages is associated with the pathophysiological response to injury and infection. Our framework provides a paradigm for the understanding of disease tolerance and resistance at the molecular level.

Abstract: Summary
Persistent neutrophil-dominated lung inflammation contributes to lung damage in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the mechanisms that drive persistent lung neutrophilia and tissue deterioration in CF are not well characterized. Starting from the observation that, in patients with CF, c-c motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)+ monocytes/macrophages are abundant in the lungs, we investigate the interplay between monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils in perpetuating lung tissue damage in CF. Here we show that CCR2+ monocytes in murine CF lungs drive pathogenic transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling and sustain a pro-inflammatory environment by facilitating neutrophil recruitment. Targeting CCR2 to lower the numbers of monocytes in CF lungs ameliorates neutrophil inflammation and pathogenic TGF-β signaling and prevents lung tissue damage. This study identifies CCR2+ monocytes as a neglected contributor to the pathogenesis of CF lung disease and as a therapeutic target for patients with CF, for whom lung hyperinflammation and tissue damage remain an issue despite recent advances in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-specific therapeutic agents.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial damage causes mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release to activate the type I interferon (IFN-I) response via the cGAS-STING pathway. mtDNA-induced inflammation promotes autoimmune- and aging-related degenerative disorders. However, the global picture of inflammation-inducing mitochondrial damages remains obscure. Here, we have performed a mitochondria-targeted CRISPR knockout screen for regulators of the IFN-I response. Strikingly, our screen reveals dozens of hits enriched with key regulators of cristae architecture, including phospholipid cardiolipin and protein complexes such as OPA1, mitochondrial contact site and cristae organization (MICOS), sorting and assembly machinery (SAM), mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB), prohibitin (PHB), and the F1Fo-ATP synthase. Disrupting these cristae organizers consistently induces mtDNA release and the STING-dependent IFN-I response. Furthermore, knocking out MTX2, a subunit of the SAM complex whose null mutations cause progeria in humans, induces a robust STING-dependent IFN-I response in mouse liver. Taken together, beyond revealing the central role of cristae architecture to prevent mtDNA release and inflammation, our results mechanistically link mitochondrial cristae disorganization and inflammation, two emerging hallmarks of aging and aging-related degenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) enhances transcription in eukaryotic cells, targeting DNA-protein interactions. FACT, a heterodimer in humans, comprises SPT16 and SSRP1 subunits. We measure nucleosome stability and dynamics in the presence of FACT and critical component domains. Optical tweezers quantify FACT/subdomain binding to nucleosomes, displacing the outer wrap of DNA, disrupting direct DNA-histone (core site) interactions, altering the energy landscape of unwrapping, and increasing the kinetics of DNA-histone disruption. Atomic force microscopy reveals nucleosome remodeling, while single-molecule fluorescence quantifies kinetics of histone loss for disrupted nucleosomes, a process accelerated by FACT. Furthermore, two isolated domains exhibit contradictory functions; while the SSRP1 HMGB domain displaces DNA, SPT16 MD/CTD stabilizes DNA-H2A/H2B dimer interactions. However, only intact FACT tethers disrupted DNA to the histones and supports rapid nucleosome reformation over several cycles of force disruption/release. These results demonstrate that key FACT domains combine to catalyze both nucleosome disassembly and reassembly.

Abstract: Summary
The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1) oscillator is widely characterized in homogenized cytosolic extracts, leaving unclear the impact of nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization. Here, by developing a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor, we track Cdk1 spatiotemporal dynamics in reconstituted cells with or without side by side and find compartmentalization significantly modulates clock properties previously found in bulk studies. Although nucleus-absent cells display highly tunable frequency, the nucleus-present cells maintain constant frequency against cyclin B1 variations. Despite high expression variability, cyclin degraded within the same duration, enabling a robust mitotic phase. Moreover, Cdk1 and cyclin B1 cycle rigorously out-of-phase, ensuring wide phase-plane orbits, essential for oscillation robustness. Although Cdk1 in homogeneous extracts is well known for delayed switch-like activation, we find active cyclin B1-Cdk1 accumulates in nuclei, without delay, until the nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) when another abrupt activation triggers anaphase. Cdk1 biphasic activation and spatial compartmentalization may together coordinate the accurate ordering of different downstream events.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute proteins are at the core of the microRNA-mediated gene silencing pathway essential for animals. In C. elegans, the microRNA-specific Argonautes ALG-1 and ALG-2 regulate multiple processes required for proper animal developmental timing and viability. Here we identified a phosphorylation site on ALG-1 that modulates microRNA association. Mutating ALG-1 serine 642 into a phospho-mimicking residue impairs microRNA binding and causes embryonic lethality and post-embryonic phenotypes that are consistent with alteration of microRNA functions. Monitoring microRNA levels in alg-1 phosphorylation mutant animals shows that microRNA passenger strands increase in abundance but are not preferentially loaded into ALG-1, indicating that the miRNA binding defects could lead to microRNA duplex accumulation. Our genetic and biochemical experiments support protein kinase A (PKA) KIN-1 as the putative kinase that phosphorylates ALG-1 serine 642. Our data indicate that PKA triggers ALG-1 phosphorylation to regulate its microRNA association during C. elegans development.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the success of CAR-T cell cancer immunotherapy, challenges in efficacy and safety remain. Investigators have begun to enhance CAR-T cells with the expression of accessory molecules to address these challenges. Current systems rely on constitutive transgene expression or multiple viral vectors, resulting in unregulated response and product heterogeneity. Here, we develop a genetic platform that combines autonomous antigen-induced production of an accessory molecule with constitutive CAR expression in a single lentiviral vector called Uni-Vect. The broad therapeutic application of Uni-Vect is demonstrated in vivo by activation-dependent expression of (1) an immunostimulatory cytokine that improves efficacy, (2) an antibody that ameliorates cytokine-release syndrome, and (3) transcription factors that modulate T cell biology. Uni-Vect is also implemented as a platform to characterize immune receptors. Overall, we demonstrate that Uni-Vect provides a foundation for a more clinically actionable next-generation cellular immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine crotonylation as a protein post-translational modification regulates diverse cellular processes and functions. However, the role of crotonylation in nutrient signaling pathways remains unclear. Here, we find a positive correlation between global crotonylation levels and leucine-deprivation-induced autophagy. Crotonylome profiling identifies many crotonylated proteins regulated by leucine deprivation. Bioinformatics analysis dominates 14-3-3 proteins in leucine-mediated crotonylome. Expression of 14-3-3ε crotonylation-deficient mutant significantly inhibits leucine-deprivation-induced autophagy. Molecular dynamics analysis shows that crotonylation increases molecular instability and disrupts the 14-3-3ε amphipathic pocket through which 14-3-3ε interacts with binding partners. Leucine-deprivation-induced 14-3-3ε crotonylation leads to the release of protein phosphatase 1B (PPM1B) from 14-3-3ε interaction. Active PPM1B dephosphorylates ULK1 and subsequently initiates autophagy. We further find that 14-3-3ε crotonylation is regulated by HDAC7. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the 14-3-3ε-PPM1B axis regulated by crotonylation may play a vital role in leucine-deprivation-induced autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
SMC complexes play key roles in genome maintenance, where they ensure efficient genome replication and segregation. The SMC complex Smc5/6 is a crucial player in DNA replication and repair, yet many molecular features that determine its roles are unclear. Here, we use single-molecule microscopy to investigate Smc5/6’s interaction with DNA. We find that Smc5/6 forms oligomers that dynamically redistribute on dsDNA by 1D diffusion and statically bind to ssDNA. Using combined force manipulation and single-molecule microscopy, we generate ssDNA-dsDNA junctions that mimic structures present in DNA repair intermediates or replication forks. We show that Smc5/6 accumulates at these junction sites, stabilizes the fork, and promotes the retention of RPA. Our observations provide a model for the complex’s enrichment at sites of replication stress and DNA lesions from where it coordinates the recruitment and activation of downstream repair proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Cholesterol is crucial for neuronal synaptic transmission, assisting in the molecular and structural organization of lipid rafts, ion channels, and exocytic proteins. Although cholesterol absence was shown to result in impaired neurotransmission, how cholesterol locally traffics and its route of action are still under debate. Here, we characterized the lipid transfer protein ORP2 in murine hippocampal neurons. We show that ORP2 preferentially localizes to the presynapse. Loss of ORP2 reduces presynaptic cholesterol levels by 50%, coinciding with a profoundly reduced release probability, enhanced facilitation, and impaired presynaptic calcium influx. In addition, ORP2 plays a cholesterol-transport-independent role in regulating vesicle priming and spontaneous release, likely by competing with Munc18-1 in syntaxin1A binding. To conclude, we identified a dual function of ORP2 as a physiological modulator of the synaptic cholesterol content and a regulator of neuronal exocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
B cell lymphopoiesis requires dynamic modulation of the B cell transcriptome for timely coordination of somatic mutagenesis and DNA repair in progenitor B (pro-B) cells. Here, we show that, in pro-B cells, the RNA-binding proteins T cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA1) and TIA1-like protein (TIAL1) act redundantly to enable developmental progression. They are global splicing regulators that control the expression of hundreds of mRNAs, including those involved in DNA damage repair. Mechanistically, TIA1 and TIAL1 bind to 5′ splice sites for exon definition, splicing, and expression of DNA damage sensors, such as Chek2 and Rif1. In their absence, pro-B cells show exacerbated DNA damage, altered P53 expression, and increased cell death. Our study uncovers the importance of tight regulation of RNA splicing by TIA1 and TIAL1 for the expression of integrative transcriptional programs that control DNA damage sensing and repair during B cell development.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota influences acetylation on host histones by fermenting dietary fiber into butyrate. Although butyrate could promote histone acetylation by inhibiting histone deacetylases, it may also undergo oxidation to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), a necessary cofactor for histone acetyltransferases. Here, we find that epithelial cells from germ-free mice harbor a loss of histone H4 acetylation across the genome except at promoter regions. Using stable isotope tracing in vivo with 13C-labeled fiber, we demonstrate that the microbiota supplies carbon for histone acetylation. Subsequent metabolomic profiling revealed hundreds of labeled molecules and supported a microbial contribution to host fatty acid metabolism, which declined in response to colitis and correlated with reduced expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. These results illuminate the flow of carbon from the diet to the host via the microbiota, disruptions to which may affect energy homeostasis in the distal gut and contribute to the development of colitis.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptation to mechanical load, leading to enhanced force and power output, is a characteristic feature of skeletal muscle. Formation of new myonuclei required for efficient muscle hypertrophy relies on prior activation and proliferation of muscle stem cells (MuSCs). However, the mechanisms controlling MuSC expansion under conditions of increased load are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that interstitial mesenchymal progenitors respond to mechanical load and stimulate MuSC proliferation in a surgical mouse model of increased muscle load. Mechanistically, transcriptional activation of Yes-associated protein 1 (Yap1)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (Taz) in mesenchymal progenitors results in local production of thrombospondin-1 (Thbs1), which, in turn, drives MuSC proliferation through CD47 signaling. Under homeostatic conditions, however, CD47 signaling is insufficient to promote MuSC proliferation and instead depends on prior downregulation of the Calcitonin receptor. Our results suggest that relayed signaling between mesenchymal progenitors and MuSCs through a Yap1/Taz-Thbs1-CD47 pathway is critical to establish the supply of MuSCs during muscle hypertrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Human organoid model systems lack important cell types that, in the embryo, are incorporated into organ tissues during development. We developed an organoid assembly approach starting with cells from the three primary germ layers—enteric neuroglial, mesenchymal, and epithelial precursors—that were derived separately from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). From these three cell types, we generated human antral and fundic gastric tissue containing differentiated glands surrounded by layers of smooth muscle containing functional enteric neurons that controlled contractions of the engineered antral tissue. Using this experimental system, we show that human enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) promote mesenchyme development and glandular morphogenesis of antral stomach organoids. Moreover, ENCCs can act directly on the foregut to promote a posterior fate, resulting in organoids with a Brunner’s gland phenotype. Thus, germ layer components that are derived separately from PSCs can be used for tissue engineering to generate complex human organoids.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of host transcriptional response signatures has emerged as a new paradigm for infection diagnosis. For clinical applications, signatures must robustly detect the pathogen of interest without cross-reacting with unintended conditions. To evaluate the performance of infectious disease signatures, we developed a framework that includes a compendium of 17,105 transcriptional profiles capturing infectious and non-infectious conditions and a standardized methodology to assess robustness and cross-reactivity. Applied to 30 published signatures of infection, the analysis showed that signatures were generally robust in detecting viral and bacterial infections in independent data. Asymptomatic and chronic infections were also detectable, albeit with decreased performance. However, many signatures were cross-reactive with unintended infections and aging. In general, we found robustness and cross-reactivity to be conflicting objectives, and we identified signature properties associated with this trade-off. The data compendium and evaluation framework developed here provide a foundation for the development of signatures for clinical application. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) threaten the effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines administered intramuscularly and designed to only target the spike protein. There is a pressing need to develop next-generation vaccine strategies for broader and long-lasting protection. Using adenoviral vectors (Ad) of human and chimpanzee origin, we evaluated Ad-vectored trivalent COVID-19 vaccines expressing spike-1, nucleocapsid, and RdRp antigens in murine models. We show that single-dose intranasal immunization, particularly with chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine, is superior to intramuscular immunization in induction of the tripartite protective immunity consisting of local and systemic antibody responses, mucosal tissue-resident memory T cells and mucosal trained innate immunity. We further show that intranasal immunization provides protection against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and two VOC, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Our findings indicate that respiratory mucosal delivery of Ad-vectored multivalent vaccine represents an effective next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy to induce all-around mucosal immunity against current and future VOC.

Abstract: Summary
Hfq, an Sm-like protein and the major RNA chaperone in E. coli, has been shown to distribute non-uniformly along a helical path under normal growth conditions and to relocate to the cell poles under certain stress conditions. We have previously shown that Hfq relocation to the poles is accompanied by polar accumulation of most small RNAs (sRNAs). Here, we show that Hfq undergoes RNA-dependent phase separation to form cytoplasmic or polar condensates of different density under normal and stress conditions, respectively. Purified Hfq forms droplets in the presence of crowding agents or RNA, indicating that its condensation is via heterotypic interactions. Stress-induced relocation of Hfq condensates and sRNAs to the poles depends on the pole-localizer TmaR. Phase separation of Hfq correlates with its ability to perform its posttranscriptional roles as sRNA-stabilizer and sRNA-mRNA matchmaker. Our study offers a spatiotemporal mechanism for sRNA-mediated regulation in response to environmental changes.

Abstract: Summary
Ovarian cancer (OC) remains a clinical challenge for its difficulty in early diagnosis and insensitivity to treatments. Gut microbiota modulate multiple carcinoma progression through immunoregulation. The relationship between OC and gut microbiota has not been fully characterized. We find that the feces of patients with OC demonstrate different characteristics from benign controls. After fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from patients with OC into OC-bearing mice, the tumor development accelerates. Further, an Akkermansia supplementation with FMT significantly suppresses OC progression in mice. RNA sequencing of tumors shows that T cell activation pathways are upregulated after Akkermansia supplementation with FMT. Moreover, acetate accumulation accompanies Akkermansia abundance elevation, which is associated with enhanced interferon γ (IFNγ) secretion of CD8+ T cells and also its tumor-killing property. This work highlights the importance of protective gut microbiome in immune surveillance of OC, which connects accumulation of acetate and the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells by increasing IFNγ secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Severe COVID-19 is linked to both dysfunctional immune response and unrestrained immunopathology, and it remains unclear whether T cells contribute to disease pathology. Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and single-cell proteomics with mechanistic studies to assess pathogenic T cell functions and inducing signals. We identified highly activated CD16+ T cells with increased cytotoxic functions in severe COVID-19. CD16 expression enabled immune-complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16+ T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16+ T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Increased generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16+ cytotoxic T cells. Proportions of activated CD16+ T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a were associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, supporting a pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce robust anti-spike (S) antibody and CD4+ T cell responses. It is not yet clear whether vaccine-induced follicular helper CD4+ T (TFH) cell responses contribute to this outstanding immunogenicity. Using fine-needle aspiration of draining axillary lymph nodes from individuals who received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, we evaluated the T cell receptor sequences and phenotype of lymph node TFH. Mining of the responding TFH T cell receptor repertoire revealed a strikingly immunodominant HLA-DPB1∗04-restricted response to S167–180 in individuals with this allele, which is among the most common HLA alleles in humans. Paired blood and lymph node specimens show that while circulating S-specific TFH cells peak one week after the second immunization, S-specific TFH persist at nearly constant frequencies for at least six months. Collectively, our results underscore the key role that robust TFH cell responses play in establishing long-term immunity by this efficacious human vaccine.

Abstract: Summary
The liver is the largest solid organ in the body, yet it remains incompletely characterized. Here we present a spatial proteogenomic atlas of the healthy and obese human and murine liver combining single-cell CITE-seq, single-nuclei sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics. By integrating these multi-omic datasets, we provide validated strategies to reliably discriminate and localize all hepatic cells, including a population of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) at the bile ducts. We then align this atlas across seven species, revealing the conserved program of bona fide Kupffer cells and LAMs. We also uncover the respective spatially resolved cellular niches of these macrophages and the microenvironmental circuits driving their unique transcriptomic identities. We demonstrate that LAMs are induced by local lipid exposure, leading to their induction in steatotic regions of the murine and human liver, while Kupffer cell development crucially depends on their cross-talk with hepatic stellate cells via the evolutionarily conserved ALK1-BMP9/10 axis.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal epithelial replenishment is fueled by continuously dividing intestinal stem cells (ISCs) resident at the crypt niche. However, the cell type(s) enabling replenishment upon damage and subsequent loss of whole crypts remain largely unclear. Using Set domain-containing protein 4 (Setd4), we identify a small population with reserve stem cell characteristics in the mouse intestine. Upon irradiation-induced injury, Setd4-expressing (Setd4+) cells survive radiation exposure and then activate to produce Sca-1-expressing cell types to restore the epithelial wall and regenerate crypts de novo via crypt fission. Setd4+ cells are confirmed to originate from the early fetal period, subsequently contributing to the development of embryonic gut and the establishment of postnatal crypts. Setd4+ cells are therefore represented as both originators and key regenerators of the intestine.

Abstract: Summary
In the conventional view of sensorimotor control, the premotor cortex (PM) plans actions that are executed by the primary motor cortex (M1). This notion arises in part from many experiments that have imposed a preparatory “planning” period, during which PM becomes active without M1. But during many natural movements, PM and M1 are co-activated, making it difficult to distinguish their functional roles. We leverage coupled dynamical systems models (cDSMs) to uncover interactions between PM and M1 during movements performed with no preparatory period. We build cDSMs using neural and behavioral data recorded from two non-human primates as they performed a reach-grasp-manipulate task. PM and M1 interact dynamically throughout these movements. Whereas PM drives the M1 in some situations, in other situations, M1 drives PM activity, contrary to the conventional assumption. Our DSM framework provides additional predictions differentiating the roles of PM and M1 in controlling movement.

Abstract: Summary
Paradoxically, glucose, the primary driver of satiety, activates a small population of anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Here, we show that lactate levels in the circulation and in the cerebrospinal fluid are elevated in the fed state and the addition of lactate to glucose activates the majority of POMC neurons while increasing cytosolic NADH generation, mitochondrial respiration, and extracellular pyruvate levels. Inhibition of lactate dehydrogenases diminishes mitochondrial respiration, NADH production, and POMC neuronal activity. However, inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier has no effect. POMC-specific downregulation of Ucp2 (Ucp2PomcKO), a molecule regulated by fatty acid metabolism and shown to play a role as transporter in the malate-aspartate shuttle, abolishes lactate- and glucose-sensing of POMC neurons. Ucp2PomcKO mice have impaired glucose metabolism and are prone to obesity on a high-fat diet. Altogether, our data show that lactate through redox signaling and blocking mitochondrial glucose utilization activates POMC neurons to regulate feeding and glucose metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The lung exhibits a robust, multifaceted regenerative response to severe injuries such as influenza infection, during which quiescent lung-resident epithelial progenitors participate in two distinct reparative pathways: functionally beneficial regeneration via alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell proliferation and differentiation, and dysplastic tissue remodeling via intrapulmonary airway-resident basal p63+ progenitors. Here we show that the basal cell transcription factor ΔNp63 is required for intrapulmonary basal progenitors to participate in dysplastic alveolar remodeling following injury. We find that ΔNp63 restricts the plasticity of intrapulmonary basal progenitors by maintaining either active or repressive histone modifications at key differentiation gene loci. Following loss of ΔNp63, intrapulmonary basal progenitors are capable of either airway or alveolar differentiation depending on their surrounding environment both in vitro and in vivo. Uncovering these regulatory mechanisms of dysplastic repair and lung basal cell fate choice highlight potential therapeutic targets to promote functional alveolar regeneration following severe lung injuries.

Abstract: Summary
Cancers display significant heterogeneity with respect to tissue of origin, driver mutations, and other features of the surrounding tissue. It is likely that individual tumors engage common patterns of the immune system—here “archetypes”—creating prototypical non-destructive tumor immune microenvironments (TMEs) and modulating tumor-targeting. To discover the dominant immune system archetypes, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Immunoprofiler Initiative (IPI) processed 364 individual tumors across 12 cancer types using standardized protocols. Computational clustering of flow cytometry and transcriptomic data obtained from cell sub-compartments uncovered dominant patterns of immune composition across cancers. These archetypes were profound insofar as they also differentiated tumors based upon unique immune and tumor gene-expression patterns. They also partitioned well-established classifications of tumor biology. The IPI resource provides a template for understanding cancer immunity as a collection of dominant patterns of immune organization and provides a rational path forward to learn how to modulate these to improve therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Aging causes an irreversible, cumulative decline in neuronal function. Using the visual system as a model, we show that astrocytes play a critical role in maintaining retinal ganglion cell health and that deletion of SPP1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1, or osteopontin) from astrocytes leads to increased vulnerability of ganglion cells to age, elevated intraocular pressure, and traumatic optic nerve damage. Overexpression of SPP1 slows the age-related decline in ganglion cell numbers and is highly protective of visual function in a mouse model of glaucoma. SPP1 acts by promoting phagocytosis and secretion of neurotrophic factors while inhibiting production of neurotoxic and pro-inflammatory factors. SPP1 up-regulates transcription of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, functionally enhances mitochondrial respiration, and promotes the integrity of mitochondrial microstructure. SPP1 increases intracellular ATP concentration via up-regulation of VDAC1.

Abstract: Summary
The Toll signaling pathway was initially identified for its involvement in the control of early embryogenesis. It was later shown to be also part of a major innate immune pathway controlling the expression of anti-microbial peptides in many eukaryotes including humans; cactus, the essential negative regulator of this pathway in flies, was found to be induced in parallel to the Toll-dependent activation process during immune defenses. We were interested in the mechanisms of this dual effect and provide here evidence that upon pathogenic stimuli, dorsal, one of the transcription factors of the fly Toll pathway, can induce the expression of the E3 ligase Bre1. We further show that Bre1 complexes with the E2 Rad6 to mono-ubiquitinate histone H2B and to promote the transcription of cactus to achieve homeostasis of the Toll immune response. Our studies characterize a Toll signal-dependent regulatory machinery in governing the Toll pathway in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue is a major public health threat. There are four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes; therefore, efforts are focused on developing safe and effective tetravalent DENV vaccines. While neutralizing antibodies contribute to protective immunity, there are still important gaps in understanding of immune responses elicited by dengue infection and vaccination. To that end, here, we develop a computational modeling framework based on the concept of antibody-virus neutralization fingerprints in order to characterize samples from clinical studies of TAK-003, a tetravalent vaccine candidate currently in phase 3 trials. Our results suggest a similarity of neutralizing antibody specificities in baseline-seronegative individuals. In contrast, amplification of pre-existing neutralizing antibody specificities is predicted for baseline-seropositive individuals, thus quantifying the role of immunologic imprinting in driving antibody responses to DENV vaccines. The neutralization fingerprinting analysis framework presented here can contribute to understanding dengue immune correlates of protection and help guide further vaccine development and optimization.

Abstract: Summary
Within the scope of the FANTOM6 consortium, we perform a large-scale knockdown of 200 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and systematically characterize their roles in self-renewal and pluripotency. We find 36 lncRNAs (18%) exhibiting cell growth inhibition. From the knockdown of 123 lncRNAs with transcriptome profiling, 36 lncRNAs (29.3%) show molecular phenotypes. Integrating the molecular phenotypes with chromatin-interaction assays further reveals cis- and trans-interacting partners as potential primary targets. Additionally, cell-type enrichment analysis identifies lncRNAs associated with pluripotency, while the knockdown of LINC02595, CATG00000090305.1, and RP11-148B6.2 modulates colony formation of iPSCs. We compare our results with previously published fibroblasts phenotyping data and find that 2.9% of the lncRNAs exhibit a consistent cell growth phenotype, whereas we observe 58.3% agreement in molecular phenotypes. This highlights that molecular phenotyping is more comprehensive in revealing affected pathways.

Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible and potentially fatal virus. So far, most comprehensive analyses encompassing clinical and transcriptional manifestation have concentrated on the lungs. Here, we confirmed evident signs of viral infection in the lungs and spleen of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice, which replicate the phenotype and infection symptoms in hospitalized humans. Seven days post viral detection in organs, infected mice showed decreased vital signs, leading to death. Bronchopneumonia due to infiltration of leukocytes in the lungs and reduction in the spleen lymphocyte region were observed. Transcriptome profiling implicated the meticulous regulation of distress and recovery from cytokine-mediated immunity by distinct immune cell types in a time-dependent manner. In lungs, the chemokine-driven response to viral invasion was highly elevated at 2 days post infection (dpi). In late infection, diseased lungs, post the innate immune process, showed recovery signs. The spleen established an even more immediate line of defense than the lungs, and the cytokine expression profile dropped at 7 dpi. At 5 dpi, spleen samples diverged into two distinct groups with different transcriptome profile and pathophysiology. Inhibition of consecutive host cell viral entry and massive immunoglobulin production and proteolysis inhibition seemed that one group endeavored to survive, while the other group struggled with developmental regeneration against consistent viral intrusion through the replication cycle. Our results may contribute to improved understanding of the longitudinal response to viral infection and development of potential therapeutics for hospitalized patients affected by SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Summary
STING, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident receptor for cyclic di-nucleotides (CDNs), is essential for innate immune responses. Upon CDN binding, STING moves from the ER to the Golgi, where it activates downstream type-I interferon (IFN) signaling. General cargo proteins exit from the ER via concentration at ER exit sites. However, the mechanism of STING concentration is poorly understood. Here, we visualize the ER exit sites of STING by blocking its transport at low temperature or by live-cell imaging with the cell-permeable ligand bis-pivSATE-2′F-c-di-dAMP, which we have developed. After ligand binding, STING forms punctate foci at non-canonical ER exit sites. Unbiased proteomic screens and super-resolution microscopy show that the Golgi-resident protein ACBD3/GCP60 recognizes and concentrates ligand-bound STING at specialized ER-Golgi contact sites. Depletion of ACBD3 impairs STING ER-to-Golgi trafficking and type-I IFN responses. Our results identify the ACBD3-mediated non-canonical cargo concentration system that drives the ER exit of STING.

Abstract: Summary
The human forebrain has expanded in size and complexity compared to chimpanzees despite limited changes in protein-coding genes, suggesting that gene expression regulation is an important driver of brain evolution. Here, we identify a KRAB-ZFP transcription factor, ZNF558, that is expressed in human but not chimpanzee forebrain neural progenitor cells. ZNF558 evolved as a suppressor of LINE-1 transposons but has been co-opted to regulate a single target, the mitophagy gene SPATA18. ZNF558 plays a role in mitochondrial homeostasis, and loss-of-function experiments in cerebral organoids suggests that ZNF558 influences developmental timing during early human brain development. Expression of ZNF558 is controlled by the size of a variable number tandem repeat that is longer in chimpanzees compared to humans, and variable in the human population. Thus, this work provides mechanistic insight into how a cis-acting structural variation establishes a regulatory network that affects human brain evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiogenesis is a tightly regulated dynamic process through a continuum of differentiation and proliferation events. Key factors and pathways governing this process remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigate mice hearts from embryonic day 10.5 to postnatal week 8 and dissect developmental changes in phosphoproteome-, proteome-, metabolome-, and transcriptome-encompassing cardiogenesis and cardiac maturation. We identify mitogen-activated protein kinases as core kinases involved in transcriptional regulation by mediating the phosphorylation of chromatin remodeling proteins during early cardiogenesis. We construct the reciprocal regulatory network of transcription factors (TFs) and identify a series of TFs controlling early cardiogenesis involved in cycling-dependent proliferation. After birth, we identify cardiac resident macrophages with high arachidonic acid metabolism activities likely involved in the clearance of injured apoptotic cardiomyocytes. Together, our comprehensive multi-omics data offer a panoramic view of cardiac development and maturation that provides a resource for further in-depth functional exploration.

Abstract: Summary
Human organoids allow the study of proliferation, lineage specification, and 3D tissue development. Here we present a genome-wide CRISPR screen in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived kidney organoids. The combination of inducible genome editing, longitudinal sampling, and endpoint sorting of tubular and stromal cells generated a complex, high-quality dataset uncovering a broad spectrum of insightful biology from early development to “adult” epithelial morphogenesis. Our functional dataset allows improving mesoderm induction by ROCK inhibition, contains monogenetic and complex trait kidney disease genes, confirms two additional congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) genes (CCDC170 and MYH7B), and provides a large candidate list of ciliopathy-related genes. Finally, identification of a cis-inhibitory effect of Jagged1 controlling epithelial proliferation shows how mosaic knockouts in pooled CRISPR screening can reveal ways of communication between heterogeneous cell populations in complex tissues. These data serve as a rich resource for the kidney research community and as a benchmark for future iPSC-derived organoid CRISPR screens.

Abstract: Summary
The cancer metastasis process involves dysregulated oncogenic kinase signaling, but how this orchestrates metabolic networks and signal cascades to promote metastasis is largely unclear. Here we report that inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) and ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) synergistically attenuates cell invasion, anoikis resistance, and immune escape in lung cancer and more evidently in tumors harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating or EGFR inhibitor-resistant mutations. Mechanistically, GDH1 is activated by EGFR through phosphorylation at tyrosine 135 and, together with RSK2, enhances the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activity via CaMKIV signaling, thereby promoting metastasis. Co-targeting RSK2 and GDH1 leads to enhanced intratumoral CD8 T cell infiltration. Moreover, GDH1, RSK2, and CREB phosphorylation positively correlate with EGFR mutation and activation in lung cancer patient tumors. Our findings reveal a crosstalk between kinase, metabolic, and transcription machinery in metastasis and offer an alternative combinatorial therapeutic strategy to target metastatic cancers with activated EGFRs that are often EGFR therapy resistant.

Abstract: Summary
The precise mechanism by which butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut contribute to resistance to respiratory viral infections remains to be elucidated. Here, we describe a gut-lung axis mechanism and report that orally administered Clostridium butyricum (CB) enhances influenza virus infection resistance through upregulation of interferon (IFN)-λ in lung epithelial cells. Gut microbiome-induced ω-3 fatty acid 18-hydroxy eicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE) promotes IFN-λ production through the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)120 and IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1/-7 activations. CB promotes 18-HEPE production in the gut and enhances ω-3 fatty acid sensitivity in the lungs by promoting GPR120 expression. This study finds a gut-lung axis mechanism and provides insights into the treatments and prophylaxis for viral respiratory infections.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are self-renewing and pluripotent. In recent years, factors that control pluripotency, mostly nuclear, have been identified. To identify non-nuclear regulators of ESCs, we screened an endogenously labeled fluorescent fusion-protein library in mouse ESCs. One of the more compelling hits was the cell-cycle-associated protein 1 (CAPRIN1). CAPRIN1 knockout had little effect in ESCs, but it significantly altered differentiation and gene expression programs. Using RIP-seq and SLAM-seq, we found that CAPRIN1 associates with, and promotes the degradation of, thousands of RNA transcripts. CAPRIN1 interactome identified XRN2 as the likely ribonuclease. Upon early ESC differentiation, XRN2 is located in the nucleus and colocalizes with CAPRIN1 in small RNA granules in a CAPRIN1-dependent manner. We propose that CAPRIN1 regulates an RNA degradation pathway operating during early ESC differentiation, thus eliminating undesired spuriously transcribed transcripts in ESCs.

Abstract: Summary
The oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata, is known for its long-distance seasonal migration and environment-dependent phase polymorphisms. Here, we present a chromosome-level genome reference and integrate multi-omics, functional genetics, and behavioral assays to explore the genetic bases of the hallmark traits of M. separata migration. Gene family comparisons show expansion of gustatory receptor genes in this cereal crop pest. Functional investigation of magnetoreception-related genes and associated flight behaviors suggest that M. separata may use the geomagnetic field to guide orientation in its nocturnal flight. Comparative transcriptome characterizes a suite of genes that may confer the observed plasticity between phases, including genes involved in protein processing, hormone regulation, and dopamine metabolism. We further report molecular signatures that underlie the dynamic regulation of a migratory syndrome coordinating reproduction and flight. Our study yields insights into environment-dependent developmental plasticity in moths and advances our understanding of long-distance migration in nocturnal insect pests.

Abstract: Summary
Diabetogenic ablation of beta cells in mice triggers a regenerative response whereby surviving beta cells proliferate and euglycemia is regained. Here, we identify and characterize heterogeneity in response to beta cell ablation. Efficient beta cell elimination leading to severe hyperglycemia (>28 mmol/L), causes permanent diabetes with failed regeneration despite cell cycle engagement of surviving beta cells. Strikingly, correction of glycemia via insulin, SGLT2 inhibition, or a ketogenic diet for about 3 weeks allows partial regeneration of beta cell mass and recovery from diabetes, demonstrating regenerative potential masked by extreme glucotoxicity. We identify gene expression changes in beta cells exposed to extremely high glucose levels, pointing to metabolic stress and downregulation of key cell cycle genes, suggesting failure of cell cycle completion. These findings reconcile conflicting data on the impact of glucose on beta cell regeneration and identify a glucose threshold converting glycemic load from pro-regenerative to anti-regenerative.

Abstract: Summary
Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring KEAP1 mutations are often resistant to immunotherapy. Here, we show that KEAP1 targets EMSY for ubiquitin-mediated degradation to regulate homologous recombination repair (HRR) and anti-tumor immunity. Loss of KEAP1 in NSCLC induces stabilization of EMSY, producing a BRCAness phenotype, i.e., HRR defects and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Defective HRR contributes to a high tumor mutational burden that, in turn, is expected to prompt an innate immune response. Notably, EMSY accumulation suppresses the type I interferon response and impairs innate immune signaling, fostering cancer immune evasion. Activation of the type I interferon response in the tumor microenvironment using a STING agonist results in the engagement of innate and adaptive immune signaling and impairs the growth of KEAP1-mutant tumors. Our results suggest that targeting PARP and STING pathways, individually or in combination, represents a therapeutic strategy in NSCLC patients harboring alterations in KEAP1.

Abstract: Summary
The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant suggests that the virus might become globally dominant. Further, the high number of mutations in the viral spike protein raised concerns that the virus might evade antibodies induced by infection or vaccination. Here, we report that the Omicron spike was resistant against most therapeutic antibodies but remained susceptible to inhibition by sotrovimab. Similarly, the Omicron spike evaded neutralization by antibodies from convalescent patients or individuals vaccinated with the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2) with 12- to 44-fold higher efficiency than the spike of the Delta variant. Neutralization of the Omicron spike by antibodies induced upon heterologous ChAdOx1 (Astra Zeneca-Oxford)/BNT162b2 vaccination or vaccination with three doses of BNT162b2 was more efficient, but the Omicron spike still evaded neutralization more efficiently than the Delta spike. These findings indicate that most therapeutic antibodies will be ineffective against the Omicron variant and that double immunization with BNT162b2 might not adequately protect against severe disease induced by this variant.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) give rise to the blood system and maintain hematopoiesis throughout the human lifespan. Here, we report a transcriptional census of human bone-marrow-derived HSPCs from the neonate, infant, child, adult, and aging stages, showing two subpopulations of multipotent progenitors separated by CD52 expression. From birth to the adult stage, stem and multipotent progenitors shared similar transcriptional alterations, and erythroid potential was enhanced after the infant stage. By integrating transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and functional data, we further showed that aging hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibited a bias toward megakaryocytic differentiation. Finally, in comparison with the HSCs from the cord blood, neonate bone-marrow-derived HSCs were more quiescent and had higher long-term regeneration capability and durable self-renewal. Taken together, this work provides an integral transcriptome landscape of HSPCs and identifies their dynamics in post-natal steady-state hemopoiesis, thereby helping explore hematopoiesis in development and diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic effector cells that target and lyse virally infected cells; many viruses therefore encode mechanisms to escape such NK cell killing. Here, we interrogate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to modulate NK cell recognition and lysis of infected cells. We find that NK cells exhibit poor cytotoxic responses against SARS-CoV-2-infected targets, preferentially killing uninfected bystander cells. We demonstrate that this escape is driven by downregulation of ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D (NKG2D-L). Indeed, early in viral infection, prior to NKG2D-L downregulation, NK cells are able to target and kill infected cells; however, this ability is lost as viral proteins are expressed. Finally, we find that SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) mediates downregulation of NKG2D-L and that Nsp1 alone is sufficient to confer resistance to NK cell killing. Collectively, our work demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 evades direct NK cell cytotoxicity and describes a mechanism by which this occurs.

Abstract: Summary
The complexity of signaling events and cellular responses unfolding in neuronal, glial, and immune cells upon traumatic brain injury (TBI) constitutes an obstacle in elucidating pathophysiological links and targets for intervention. We use array phosphoproteomics in a murine mild blunt TBI to reconstruct the temporal dynamics of tyrosine-kinase signaling in TBI and then scrutinize the large-scale effects of perturbation of Met/HGFR, VEGFR1, and Btk signaling by small molecules. We show Met/HGFR as a selective modifier of early microglial response and that Met/HGFR blockade prevents the induction of microglial inflammatory mediators, of reactive microglia morphology, and TBI-associated responses in neurons and vasculature. Both acute and prolonged Met/HGFR inhibition ameliorate neuronal survival and motor recovery. Early elevation of HGF itself in the cerebrospinal fluid of TBI patients suggests that this mechanism has translational value in human subjects. Our findings identify Met/HGFR as a modulator of early neuroinflammation in TBI with promising translational potential.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA damage response (DDR) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are two crucial cellular programs in cancer biology. While the DDR orchestrates cell-cycle progression, DNA repair, and cell death, EMT promotes invasiveness, cellular plasticity, and intratumor heterogeneity. Therapeutic targeting of EMT transcription factors, such as ZEB1, remains challenging, but tumor-promoting DDR alterations elicit specific vulnerabilities. Using multi-omics, inhibitors, and high-content microscopy, we discover a chemoresistant ZEB1-high-expressing sub-population (ZEB1hi) with co-rewired cell-cycle progression and proficient DDR across tumor entities. ZEB1 stimulates accelerated S-phase entry via CDK6, inflicting endogenous DNA replication stress. However, DDR buildups involving constitutive MRE11-dependent fork resection allow homeostatic cycling and enrichment of ZEB1hi cells during transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-induced EMT and chemotherapy. Thus, ZEB1 promotes G1/S transition to launch a progressive DDR benefitting stress tolerance, which concurrently manifests a targetable vulnerability in chemoresistant ZEB1hi cells. Our study thus highlights the translationally relevant intercept of the DDR and EMT.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) may serve as the cellular seeds of tumor recurrence and metastasis, and they can be generated via epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs). Isolating pure populations of CSCs is difficult because EMT programs generate multiple alternative cell states, and phenotypic plasticity permits frequent interconversions between these states. Here, we used cell-surface expression of integrin β4 (ITGB4) to isolate highly enriched populations of human breast CSCs, and we identified the gene regulatory network operating in ITGB4+ CSCs. Specifically, we identified ΔNp63 and p73, the latter of which transactivates ΔNp63, as centrally important transcriptional regulators of quasi-mesenchymal CSCs that reside in an intermediate EMT state. We found that the transcriptional program controlled by ΔNp63 in CSCs is largely distinct from the one that it orchestrates in normal basal mammary stem cells and, instead, it more closely resembles a regenerative epithelial stem cell response to wounding. Moreover, quasi-mesenchymal CSCs repurpose this program to drive metastatic colonization via autocrine EGFR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) rely on complex regulatory networks to preserve stemness. Due to the scarcity of HSCs, technical challenges have limited our insights into the interplay between metabolites, transcription, and the epigenome. In this study, we generated low-input metabolomics, transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data, revealing distinct metabolic hubs that are enriched in HSCs and their downstream multipotent progenitors. Mechanistically, we uncover a non-classical retinoic acid (RA) signaling axis that regulates HSC function. We show that HSCs rely on Cyp26b1, an enzyme conventionally considered to limit RA effects in the cell. In contrast to the traditional view, we demonstrate that Cyp26b1 is indispensable for production of the active metabolite 4-oxo-RA. Further, RA receptor beta (Rarb) is required for complete transmission of 4-oxo-RA-mediated signaling to maintain stem cells. Our findings emphasize that a single metabolite controls stem cell fate by instructing epigenetic and transcriptional attributes.

Abstract: Summary
In aging, androgenic alopecia, and genetic hypotrichosis disorders, hair shaft miniaturization is often associated with hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) loss. However, the mechanism causing this stem cell depletion in vivo remains elusive. Here we show that hair shaft loss or a reduction in diameter shrinks the physical niche size, which results in mechanical compression of HFSCs and their apoptotic loss. Mechanistically, cell compression activates the mechanosensitive channel Piezo1, which triggers calcium influx. This confers tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) sensitivity in a hair-cycle-dependent manner in otherwise resistant HFSCs and induces ectopic apoptosis. Persistent hair shaft miniaturization during aging and genetic hypotrichosis disorders causes long-term HFSC loss by inducing continuous ectopic apoptosis through Piezo1. Our results identify an unconventional role of the inert hair shaft structure as a functional niche component governing HFSC survival and reveal a mechanosensory axis that regulates physical-niche-atrophy-induced stem cell depletion in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Anelloviruses represent a major constituent of the commensal human virome; however, little is known about their immunobiology. Here, we present “AnelloScan,” a T7 phage library representing the open reading frame 1 (ORF1), ORF2, ORF3, and torque teno virus (TTV)-derived apoptosis-inducing protein (TAIP) sequences of more than 800 human anelloviruses and profile the antibody reactivities of serum samples from a cross-sectional cohort of 156 subjects by using phage-immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq). A majority of anellovirus peptides are not reactive in any of the subjects tested (n = ∼28,000; ∼85% of the library). Antibody-reactive peptides are largely restricted to the C-terminal region of the capsid protein ORF1. Moreover, using a longitudinal cohort of matched blood-transfusion donors and recipients, we find that most transmitted anelloviruses do not elicit a detectable antibody reactivity in the recipient and that the remainder elicit delayed responses appearing ∼100–150 days after transfusion.

Abstract: Summary
EKLF/Klf1 is a zinc-finger transcription activator essential for erythroid lineage commitment and terminal differentiation. Using ChIP-seq, we investigate EKLF DNA binding and transcription activation mechanisms during mouse embryonic erythropoiesis. We utilize the Nan/+ mouse that expresses the EKLF-E339D (Nan) variant mutated in its conserved zinc-finger region and address the mechanism of hypomorphic and neomorphic changes in downstream gene expression. First, we show that Nan-EKLF limits normal EKLF binding to a subset of its sites. Second, we find that ectopic binding of Nan-EKLF occurs largely at enhancers and activates transcription through pioneering activity. Third, we find that for a subset of ectopic targets, gene activation is achieved in Nan/+ only by Nan-EKLF binding to distal enhancers, leading to RNA polymerase II pause-release. These results have general applicability to understanding how a DNA binding variant factor confers dominant disruptive effects on downstream gene expression even in the presence of its normal counterpart.

Abstract: Summary
SMAD4 is frequently mutated and inactivated in human gastric cancer (GC). Although the epithelial cell-autonomous functions of Smad4 have been extensively studied, its contribution to tumor immunity is largely undetermined. Here, we report that the loss of Smad4 expression in GC cells endows them with the ability to evade tumor immunity. Unlike their Smad4-proficient counterparts, Smad4-deficient stomach organoids can evade host immunity to form tumors in immunocompetent mice. Smad4-deficient GC cells show expanded CD133+ cancer stem-like cells while suppressing dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and cytotoxic T cells with granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (G-MDSC) accumulation through a secretome containing CXCL1. Moreover, Smad4 deficiency increases programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and decreases 4-1BBL expressions, indicating a change in immunogenicity. Combinatorial immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) of anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 or agonistic anti-4-1BB antibodies effectively treats ICB monotherapy-resistant Smad4-deficient allografts, exposing a specific vulnerability. Collectively, these data provide a rational basis for ICB strategies in treating advanced GC with Smad4 deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Conifers dominate the world’s forest ecosystems and are the most widely planted tree species. Their giant and complex genomes present great challenges for assembling a complete reference genome for evolutionary and genomic studies. We present a 25.4-Gb chromosome-level assembly of Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) and revealed that its genome size is mostly attributable to huge intergenic regions and long introns with high transposable element (TE) content. Large genes with long introns exhibited higher expressions levels. Despite a lack of recent whole-genome duplication, 91.2% of genes were duplicated through dispersed duplication, and expanded gene families are mainly related to stress responses, which may underpin conifers’ adaptation, particularly in cold and/or arid conditions. The reproductive regulation network is distinct compared with angiosperms. Slow removal of TEs with high-level methylation may have contributed to genomic expansion. This study provides insights into conifer evolution and resources for advancing research on conifer adaptation and development.

Abstract: Summary
Contrary to multicellular organisms that display segmentation during development, communities of unicellular organisms are believed to be devoid of such sophisticated patterning. Unexpectedly, we find that the gene expression underlying the nitrogen stress response of a developing Bacillus subtilis biofilm becomes organized into a ring-like pattern. Mathematical modeling and genetic probing of the underlying circuit indicate that this patterning is generated by a clock and wavefront mechanism, similar to that driving vertebrate somitogenesis. We experimentally validated this hypothesis by showing that predicted nutrient conditions can even lead to multiple concentric rings, resembling segments. We additionally confirmed that this patterning mechanism is driven by cell-autonomous oscillations. Importantly, we show that the clock and wavefront process also spatially patterns sporulation within the biofilm. Together, these findings reveal a biofilm segmentation clock that organizes cellular differentiation in space and time, thereby challenging the paradigm that such patterning mechanisms are exclusive to plant and animal development.

Abstract: Summary
Game animals are wildlife species traded and consumed as food and are potential reservoirs for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We performed a meta-transcriptomic analysis of 1,941 game animals, representing 18 species and five mammalian orders, sampled across China. From this, we identified 102 mammalian-infecting viruses, with 65 described for the first time. Twenty-one viruses were considered as potentially high risk to humans and domestic animals. Civets (Paguma larvata) carried the highest number of potentially high-risk viruses. We inferred the transmission of bat-associated coronavirus from bats to civets, as well as cross-species jumps of coronaviruses from bats to hedgehogs, from birds to porcupines, and from dogs to raccoon dogs. Of note, we identified avian Influenza A virus H9N2 in civets and Asian badgers, with the latter displaying respiratory symptoms, as well as cases of likely human-to-wildlife virus transmission. These data highlight the importance of game animals as potential drivers of disease emergence.

Abstract: Summary
Organisms use several strategies to mitigate mitochondrial stress, including the activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). The UPRmt in Caenorhabditis elegans, regulated by the transcription factor ATFS-1, expands on this recovery program by inducing an antimicrobial response against pathogens that target mitochondrial function. Here, we show that the mammalian ortholog of ATFS-1, ATF5, protects the host during infection with enteric pathogens but, unexpectedly, by maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Intriguingly, ATF5 supports intestinal barrier function by promoting a satiety response that prevents obesity and associated hyperglycemia. This consequently averts dysregulated glucose metabolism that is detrimental to barrier function. Mechanistically, we show that intestinal ATF5 stimulates the satiety response by transcriptionally regulating the gastrointestinal peptide hormone cholecystokinin, which promotes the secretion of the hormone leptin. We propose that ATF5 protects the host from enteric pathogens by promoting intestinal barrier function through a satiety-response-mediated metabolic control mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Recent surveillance has revealed the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (BA.1/B.1.1.529) harboring up to 36 mutations in spike protein, the target of neutralizing antibodies. Given its potential to escape vaccine-induced humoral immunity, we measured the neutralization potency of sera from 88 mRNA-1273, 111 BNT162b, and 40 Ad26.COV2.S vaccine recipients against wild-type, Delta, and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. We included individuals that received their primary series recently (<3 months), distantly (6–12 months), or an additional “booster” dose, while accounting for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably, neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in most vaccinees. However, individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines exhibited potent neutralization of Omicron, only 4–6-fold lower than wild type, suggesting enhanced cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, we find that Omicron pseudovirus infects more efficiently than other variants tested. Overall, this study highlights the importance of additional mRNA doses to broaden neutralizing antibody responses against highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Abstract: Summary
Hundreds of microbiota genes are associated with host biology/disease. Unraveling the causal contribution of a microbiota gene to host biology remains difficult because many are encoded by nonmodel gut commensals and not genetically targetable. A general approach to identify their gene transfer methodology and build their gene manipulation tools would enable mechanistic dissections of their impact on host physiology. We developed a pipeline that identifies the gene transfer methods for multiple nonmodel microbes spanning five phyla, and we demonstrated the utility of their genetic tools by modulating microbiome-derived short-chain fatty acids and bile acids in vitro and in the host. In a proof-of-principle study, by deleting a commensal gene for bile acid synthesis in a complex microbiome, we discovered an intriguing role of this gene in regulating colon inflammation. This technology will enable genetically engineering the nonmodel gut microbiome and facilitate mechanistic dissection of microbiota-host interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are well known to elicit health benefits in humans, but their functional metabolic landscapes remain unexplored. Here, we analyze differences in growth, intestinal persistence, and postbiotic biosynthesis of six representative LAB and their interactions with 15 gut bacteria under 11 dietary regimes by combining multi-omics and in silico modeling. We confirmed predictions on short-term persistence of LAB and their interactions with commensals using cecal microbiome abundance and spent-medium experiments. Our analyses indicate that probiotic attributes are both diet and species specific and cannot be solely explained using genomics. For example, although both Lacticaseibacillus casei and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum encode similarly sized genomes with diverse capabilities, L. casei exhibits a more desirable phenotype. In addition, “high-fat/low-carb” diets more likely lead to detrimental outcomes for most LAB. Collectively, our results highlight that probiotics are not “one size fits all” health supplements and lay the foundation for personalized probiotic design.

Abstract: Summary
Methods to deliver gene editing agents in vivo as ribonucleoproteins could offer safety advantages over nucleic acid delivery approaches. We report the development and application of engineered DNA-free virus-like particles (eVLPs) that efficiently package and deliver base editor or Cas9 ribonucleoproteins. By engineering VLPs to overcome cargo packaging, release, and localization bottlenecks, we developed fourth-generation eVLPs that mediate efficient base editing in several primary mouse and human cell types. Using different glycoproteins in eVLPs alters their cellular tropism. Single injections of eVLPs into mice support therapeutic levels of base editing in multiple tissues, reducing serum Pcsk9 levels 78% following 63% liver editing, and partially restoring visual function in a mouse model of genetic blindness. In vitro and in vivo off-target editing from eVLPs was virtually undetected, an improvement over AAV or plasmid delivery. These results establish eVLPs as promising vehicles for therapeutic macromolecule delivery that combine key advantages of both viral and nonviral delivery.

Abstract: Summary
Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) represent an emerging global crisis. However, quantifiable risk factors for PASC and their biological associations are poorly resolved. We executed a deep multi-omic, longitudinal investigation of 309 COVID-19 patients from initial diagnosis to convalescence (2–3 months later), integrated with clinical data and patient-reported symptoms. We resolved four PASC-anticipating risk factors at the time of initial COVID-19 diagnosis: type 2 diabetes, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and specific auto-antibodies. In patients with gastrointestinal PASC, SARS-CoV-2-specific and CMV-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited unique dynamics during recovery from COVID-19. Analysis of symptom-associated immunological signatures revealed coordinated immunity polarization into four endotypes, exhibiting divergent acute severity and PASC. We find that immunological associations between PASC factors diminish over time, leading to distinct convalescent immune states. Detectability of most PASC factors at COVID-19 diagnosis emphasizes the importance of early disease measurements for understanding emergent chronic conditions and suggests PASC treatment strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Striated muscle is a highly organized structure composed of well-defined anatomical domains with integrated but distinct assignments. So far, the lack of a direct correlation between tissue architecture and gene expression has limited our understanding of how each unit responds to physio-pathologic contexts. Here, we show how the combined use of spatially resolved transcriptomics and immunofluorescence can bridge this gap by enabling the unbiased identification of such domains and the characterization of their response to external perturbations. Using a spatiotemporal analysis, we follow changes in the transcriptome of specific domains in muscle in a model of denervation. Furthermore, our approach enables us to identify the spatial distribution and nerve dependence of atrophic signaling pathway and polyamine metabolism to glycolytic fibers. Indeed, we demonstrate that perturbations of polyamine pathway can affect muscle function. Our dataset serves as a resource for future studies of the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle homeostasis and innervation.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we ask why the nail base is essential for mammalian digit tip regeneration, focusing on the inductive nail mesenchyme. We identify a transcriptional signature for these cells that includes Lmx1b and show that the Lmx1b-expressing nail mesenchyme is essential for blastema formation. We use a combination of Lmx1bCreERT2-based lineage-tracing and single-cell transcriptional analyses to show that the nail mesenchyme contributes cells for two pro-regenerative mechanisms. One group of cells maintains their identity and regenerates the new nail mesenchyme. A second group contributes specifically to the dorsal blastema, loses their nail mesenchyme phenotype, acquires a blastema transcriptional state that is highly similar to blastema cells of other origins, and ultimately contributes to regeneration of the dorsal but not ventral dermis and bone. Thus, the regenerative necessity for an intact nail base is explained, at least in part, by a requirement for the inductive nail mesenchyme.

Abstract: Summary
Temporal lobe epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder, with about 40% of patients not responding to pharmacological treatment. Increased cellular loss is linked to disease severity and pathological phenotypes such as heightened seizure propensity. While the hippocampus is the target of therapeutic interventions, the impact of the disease at the cellular level remains unclear. Here, we show that hippocampal granule cells change with disease progression as measured in living, resected hippocampal tissue excised from patients with epilepsy. We show that granule cells increase excitability and shorten response latency while also enlarging in cellular volume and spine density. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing combined with simulations ascribes the changes to three conductances: BK, Cav2.2, and Kir2.1. In a network model, we show that these changes related to disease progression bring the circuit into a more excitable state, while reversing them produces a less excitable, “early-disease-like” state.

Abstract: Summary
SAG/RBX2 is an E3 ligase, whereas SHOC2 is a RAS-RAF positive regulator. In this study, we address how Sag-Shoc2 crosstalk regulates pancreatic tumorigenesis induced by KrasG12D. Sag deletion increases the size of pancreas and causes the conversion of murine pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (mPanINs) to neoplastic cystic lesions with a mechanism involving Shoc2 accumulation, suggesting that Sag determines the pathological process via targeting Shoc2. Shoc2 deletion significantly inhibits pancreas growth, mPanIN formation, and acinar cell transdifferentiation, indicating that Shoc2 is essential for KrasG12D-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis. Likewise, in a primary acinar 3D culture, Sag deletion inhibits acinar-to-ductal transdifferentiation, while Shoc2 deletion significantly reduces the duct-like structures. Mechanistically, SAG is an E3 ligase that targets SHOC2 for degradation to affect both Mapk and mTorc1 pathways. Shoc2 deletion completely rescues the phenotype of neoplastic cystic lesions induced by Sag deletion, indicating physiological relevance of the Sag-Shoc2 crosstalk. Thus, the Sag-Shoc2 axis specifies the pancreatic tumor types induced by KrasG12D.

Abstract: Summary
mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 Delta wanes over time; however, there are limited data on the impact of durability of immune responses on protection. Here, we immunized rhesus macaques and assessed immune responses over 1 year in blood and upper and lower airways. Serum neutralizing titers to Delta were 280 and 34 reciprocal ID50 at weeks 6 (peak) and 48 (challenge), respectively. Antibody-binding titers also decreased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Four days after Delta challenge, the virus was unculturable in BAL, and subgenomic RNA declined by ∼3-log10 compared with control animals. In nasal swabs, sgRNA was reduced by 1-log10, and the virus remained culturable. Anamnestic antibodies (590-fold increased titer) but not T cell responses were detected in BAL by day 4 post-challenge. mRNA-1273-mediated protection in the lungs is durable but delayed and potentially dependent on anamnestic antibody responses. Rapid and sustained protection in upper and lower airways may eventually require a boost.

Abstract: Summary
On 24th November 2021, the sequence of a new SARS-CoV-2 viral isolate Omicron-B.1.1.529 was announced, containing far more mutations in Spike (S) than previously reported variants. Neutralization titers of Omicron by sera from vaccinees and convalescent subjects infected with early pandemic Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or Delta are substantially reduced, or the sera failed to neutralize. Titers against Omicron are boosted by third vaccine doses and are high in both vaccinated individuals and those infected by Delta. Mutations in Omicron knock out or substantially reduce neutralization by most of the large panel of potent monoclonal antibodies and antibodies under commercial development. Omicron S has structural changes from earlier viruses and uses mutations that confer tight binding to ACE2 to unleash evolution driven by immune escape. This leads to a large number of mutations in the ACE2 binding site and rebalances receptor affinity to that of earlier pandemic viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by keratinocyte proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration induced by IL-17. However, the molecular mechanism through which IL-17 signaling in keratinocytes triggers skin inflammation remains not fully understood. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a glycolytic enzyme, has been shown to have non-metabolic functions. Here, we report that PKM2 mediates IL-17A signaling in keratinocytes triggering skin psoriatic inflammation. We find high expression of PKM2 in the epidermis of psoriatic patients and mice undergoing psoriasis models. Specific depletion of PKM2 in keratinocytes attenuates the development of experimental psoriasis by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Mechanistically, PKM2 forms a complex with Act1 and TRAF6 regulating NF-κB transcriptional signaling downstream of the IL-17 receptor. As IL-17 also induces PKM2 expression in keratinocytes, our findings reveal a sustained signaling circuit critical for the psoriasis-driving effects of IL-17A, suggesting that PKM2 is a potential therapeutic target for psoriasis.

Abstract: Summary
The fungus Fusarium graminearum causes a devastating disease Gibberella stalk rot of maize. Our knowledge of molecular interactions between F. graminearum effectors and maize immunity factors is lacking. Here, we show that a group of cysteine-rich common in fungal extracellular membrane (CFEM) domain proteins of F. graminearum are required for full virulence in maize stalk infection and that they interact with two secreted maize proteins, ZmLRR5 and ZmWAK17ET. ZmWAK17ET is an alternative splicing isoform of a wall-associated kinase ZmWAK17. Both ZmLRR5 and ZmWAK17ET interact with the extracellular domain of ZmWAK17. Transgenic maize overexpressing ZmWAK17 shows increased resistance to F. graminearum, while ZmWAK17 mutants exhibit enhanced susceptibility to F. graminearum. Transient expression of ZmWAK17 in Nicotiana benthamiana triggers hypersensitive cell death, whereas co-expression of CFEMs with ZmWAK17ET or ZmLRR5 suppresses the ZmWAK17-triggered cell death. Our results show that ZmWAK17 mediates stalk rot resistance and that F. graminearum delivers apoplastic CFEMs to compromise ZmWAK17-mediated resistance.

Abstract: Summary
How transcription is regulated as development commences is fundamental to understand how the transcriptionally silent mature gametes are reprogrammed. The embryonic genome is activated for the first time during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). How RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and productive elongation are regulated during this process remains elusive. Here, we generate genome-wide maps of Serine 5 and Serine 2-phosphorylated Pol II during and after ZGA in mouse embryos. We find that both phosphorylated Pol II forms display similar distributions across genes during ZGA, with typical elongation enrichment of Pol II emerging after ZGA. Serine 2-phosphorylated Pol II occurs at genes prior to their activation, suggesting that Serine 2 phosphorylation may prime gene expression. Functional perturbations demonstrate that CDK9 and SPT5 are major ZGA regulators and that SPT5 prevents precocious activation of some genes. Overall, our work sheds molecular insights into transcriptional regulation at the beginning of mammalian development.

Abstract: Summary
Animals sense and adapt to decreased oxygen availability, but whether and how hypoxia exposure in ancestors can elicit phenotypic consequences in normoxia-reared descendants are unclear. We show that hypoxia educes an intergenerational reduction in lipids and a transgenerational reduction in fertility in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The transmission of these epigenetic phenotypes is dependent on repressive histone-modifying enzymes and the argonaute HRDE-1. Feeding naive C. elegans small RNAs extracted from hypoxia-treated worms is sufficient to induce a fertility defect. Furthermore, the endogenous small interfering RNA F44E5.4/5 is upregulated intergenerationally in response to hypoxia, and soaking naive normoxia-reared C. elegans with F44E5.4/5 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is sufficient to induce an intergenerational fertility defect. Finally, we demonstrate that labeled F44E5.4/5 dsRNA is itself transmitted from parents to children. Our results suggest that small RNAs respond to the environment and are sufficient to transmit non-genetic information from parents to their naive children.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are critical mediators during the early stages of innate inflammation in response to bacterial or fungal infections. A human hematopoietic system reconstituted in humanized mice aids in the study of human hematology and immunology. However, the poor development of human neutrophils is a well-known limitation of humanized mice. Here, we generate a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF) knockin (KI) NOD/Shi-scid-IL2rgnull (NOG) mouse in which hG-CSF is systemically expressed while the mouse G-CSF receptor is disrupted. These mice generate high numbers of mature human neutrophils, which can be readily mobilized into the periphery, compared with conventional NOG mice. Moreover, these neutrophils exhibit infection-mediated emergency granulopoiesis and are capable of efficient phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species production. Thus, hG-CSF KI mice provide a useful model for studying the development of human neutrophils, emergency granulopoiesis, and a potential therapeutic model for sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
The role of postnatal experience in sculpting cortical circuitry, while long appreciated, is poorly understood at the level of cell types. We explore this in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, visual deprivation, genetics, and functional imaging. We find that vision selectively drives the specification of glutamatergic cell types in upper layers (L) (L2/3/4), while deeper-layer glutamatergic, GABAergic, and non-neuronal cell types are established prior to eye opening. L2/3 cell types form an experience-dependent spatial continuum defined by the graded expression of ∼200 genes, including regulators of cell adhesion and synapse formation. One of these genes, Igsf9b, a vision-dependent gene encoding an inhibitory synaptic cell adhesion molecule, is required for the normal development of binocular responses in L2/3. In summary, vision preferentially regulates the development of upper-layer glutamatergic cell types through the regulation of cell-type-specific gene expression programs.

Restoring glutamate receptor signaling in pancreatic alpha cells rescues glucagon responses in type 1 diabetes,

Abstract: Summary
Glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells is crucial to prevent hypoglycemia. People with type 1 diabetes lose this glucoregulatory mechanism and are susceptible to dangerous hypoglycemia for reasons still unclear. Here we determine that alpha cells in living pancreas slices from donors with type 1 diabetes do not mount an adequate glucagon response and cannot activate the positive autocrine feedback mediated by AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors. This feedback is required to elicit full glucagon responses in the healthy state. Reactivating residual AMPA/kainate receptor function with positive allosteric modulators restores glucagon secretion in human slices from donors with type 1 diabetes as well as glucose counterregulation in non-obese diabetic mice. Our study thus identifies a defect in autocrine signaling that contributes to alpha cell failure. The use of positive allosteric modulators of AMPA/kainate receptors overcomes this deficiency and prevents hypoglycemia, an effect that could be used to improve the management of diabetes.
