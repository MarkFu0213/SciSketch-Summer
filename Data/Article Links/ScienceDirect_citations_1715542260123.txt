Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an irreversible, progressive and lethal lung disease. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th17 cells both are involved in lung fibrosis. But there are only few reports regarding the effect of Treg on other T cell subsets in experimental lung fibrosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Treg on Th17, CD4+CD28-T, CD4+CD28+T and CD8 + T cell subsets that could drive lung fibrosis. To reach the goal of our study, first we depleted Tregs by anti-CD25 mAb injection in experimental C57BL/6 mice model. It has been demonstrated in our study that depletion of Treg ameliorates bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis by immune modulating Th17 and other important T cell subsets response in lung. Our flow cytometry data revealed that the percentages of Th17, CD4+CD28-T, CD4+CD28+T and CD8 + T cell subsets were decreased in experimental lung fibrosis after Treg depletion. We also observed significant downregulation of IL-17 A in Treg-depleted mice after bleomycin delivery. In addition, the study also suggested that Treg depletion led to considerable upregulation of IFN-γ after bleomycin administration. Therefore, Th17 cells, CD8 + T cells, CD4+CD28- and CD4+CD28+ T cell subsets all are controlled by regulatory T cell, help in progression of fibrosis in experimental lung fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Kidney cancer, one of the ten most prevalent malignancies in the world, has exhibited increased incidence over the last decade. The most common subtype is “clear cell” renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which features consistent metabolic abnormalities, such as highly elevated glycogen and lipid deposition. By integrating metabolomics, genomic, and transcriptomic data, we determined that enzymes in multiple metabolic pathways are universally depleted in human ccRCC tumors, which are otherwise genetically heterogeneous. Notably, the expression of key urea cycle enzymes, including arginase 2 (ARG2) and argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), is strongly repressed in ccRCC. Reduced ARG2 activity promotes ccRCC tumor growth through at least two distinct mechanisms: conserving the critical biosynthetic cofactor pyridoxal phosphate and avoiding toxic polyamine accumulation. Pharmacological approaches to restore urea cycle enzyme expression would greatly expand treatment strategies for ccRCC patients, where current therapies only benefit a subset of those afflicted with renal cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Immunoglobulin M (IgM) memory cells undergo differentiation in germinal centers following antigen challenge, but the full effector cell potential of these cells is unknown. We monitored the differentiation of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP)-labeled CD11c+ and CD11cneg T-bet+ IgM memory cells after their transfer into naive recipient mice. Following challenge infection, many memory cells differentiated into IgM-producing plasmablasts. Other donor B cells entered germinal centers, downregulated CD11c, underwent class switch recombination, and became switched memory cells. Yet other donor cells were maintained as IgM memory cells, and these IgM memory cells retained their multi-lineage potential following serial transfer. These findings were corroborated at the molecular level using immune repertoire analyses. Thus, IgM memory cells can differentiate into all effector B cell lineages and undergo self-renewal, properties that are characteristic of stem cells. We propose that these memory cells exist to provide long-term multi-functional immunity and act primarily to maintain the production of protective antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple mechanisms of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been identified in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, recurrent resistance to EGFR TKIs due to the heterogeneous mechanisms underlying resistance within a single patient remains a major challenge in the clinic. Here, we report a role of nuclear protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) as a common axis across multiple known TKI-resistance mechanisms. Specifically, we demonstrate that TKI-inactivated EGFR dimerizes with other membrane receptors implicated in TKI resistance to promote PKCδ nuclear translocation. Moreover, the level of nuclear PKCδ is associated with TKI response in patients. The combined inhibition of PKCδ and EGFR induces marked regression of resistant NSCLC tumors with EGFR mutations.

Abstract: Summary
The cuticular skeleton of a butterfly wing scale cell is an exquisitely finely sculpted material that can contain pigments, produce structural colors, or both. While cuticle rigidity and pigmentation depend on the products of the melanin pathway, little is known about whether genes in this pathway also play a role in the development of specific scale morphologies. Here, we use CRISPR/Cas9 to show that knockout mutations in five genes that function in the melanin pathway affect both the fine structure and the coloration of the wing scales. Most dramatically, mutations in the yellow gene lead to extra horizontal laminae on the surface of scales, whereas mutations in DDC gene lead to taller and sheet-like vertical laminae throughout each scale. We identify genes affecting the development of color and scale morphology, the regulation and pleiotropic effects of which may be important in creating and limiting the diversity of the structural and pigmentary colors observed in butterflies.

Abstract: Summary
Histone modifications influence higher-order chromatin structures at individual epigenomic states and chromatin environments to regulate gene expression. However, genome-wide higher-order chromatin structures shaped by different histone modifications remain poorly characterized. With stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), we characterized the higher-order chromatin structures at their epigenomic states, categorized into three major types in interphase: histone acetylation marks form spatially segregated nanoclusters, active histone methylation marks form spatially dispersed larger nanodomains, and repressive histone methylation marks form condensed large aggregates. These distinct structural characteristics are also observed in mitotic chromosomes. Furthermore, active histone marks coincide with less compact chromatin and exhibit a higher degree of co-localization with other active marks and RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), while repressive marks coincide with densely packed chromatin and spatially distant from repressive marks and active RNAP II. Taken together, super-resolution imaging reveals three distinct chromatin structures at various epigenomic states, which may be spatially coordinated to impact transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Liver disease is linked to a decreased capacity of hepatocytes to divide. In addition, cellular metabolism is important for tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Since metabolic changes are a hallmark of liver disease, we investigated the connections between metabolism and cell division. We determined global metabolic changes at different stages of liver regeneration using a combination of integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses with advanced functional redox in vivo imaging. Our data indicate that blocking hepatocyte division during regeneration leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and downregulation of oxidative pathways. This resulted in an increased redox ratio and hyperactivity of alanine transaminase allowing the production of alanine and α-ketoglutarate from pyruvate when mitochondrial functions are impaired. Our data suggests that during liver regeneration, cell division leads to hepatic metabolic remodeling. Moreover, we demonstrate that hepatocytes are equipped with a flexible metabolic machinery able to adapt dynamically to changes during tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
To counteract oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS), bacteria evolved various mechanisms, primarily reducing ROS through antioxidant systems that utilize cofactor NADPH. Cells must stabilize NADPH levels by increasing flux through replenishing metabolic pathways like pentose phosphate (PP) pathway. Here, we investigate the mechanism enabling the rapid increase in NADPH supply by exposing Escherichia coli to hydrogen peroxide and quantifying the immediate metabolite dynamics. To systematically infer active regulatory interactions governing this response, we evaluated ensembles of kinetic models of glycolysis and PP pathway, each with different regulation mechanisms. Besides the known inactivation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase by ROS, we reveal the important allosteric inhibition of the first PP pathway enzyme by NADPH. This NADPH feedback inhibition maintains a below maximum-capacity PP pathway flux under non-stress conditions. Relieving this inhibition instantly increases PP pathway flux upon oxidative stress. We demonstrate that reducing cells' capacity to rapidly reroute their flux through the PP pathway increases their oxidative stress sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative polyadenylation generates numerous 3′ mRNA isoforms that can vary in biological properties, such as stability and localization. We developed methods to obtain transcriptome-scale structural information and protein binding on individual 3′ mRNA isoforms in vivo. Strikingly, near-identical mRNA isoforms can possess dramatically different structures throughout the 3′ UTR. Analyses of identical mRNAs in different species or refolded in vitro indicate that structural differences in vivo are often due to trans-acting factors. The level of Pab1 binding to poly(A)-containing isoforms is surprisingly variable, and differences in Pab1 binding correlate with the extent of structural variation for closely spaced isoforms. A pattern encompassing single-strandedness near the 3′ terminus, double-strandedness of the poly(A) tail, and low Pab1 binding is associated with mRNA stability. Thus, individual 3′ mRNA isoforms can be remarkably different physical entities in vivo. Sequences responsible for isoform-specific structures, differential Pab1 binding, and mRNA stability are evolutionarily conserved, indicating biological function.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary salt reduction and exercise are lifestyle modifications for salt-sensitive hypertensives. While exercise has prominent metabolic effects, salt has an adverse effect on metabolic syndrome, of which hypertension is a hallmark. We hypothesized that dietary salt impacts metabolism in a salt-sensitive model of hypertension. An untargeted metabolomic approach demonstrates lower circulating levels of the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), in high salt-fed hypertensive rats. Despite the high salt intake, specific rescue of βOHB levels by nutritional supplementation of its precursor, 1,3-butanediol, attenuates hypertension and protects kidney function. This beneficial effect of βOHB was likely independent of gut-microbiotal and Th17-mediated effects of salt and instead facilitated by βOHB inhibiting the renal Nlrp3 inflammasome. The juxtaposed effects of dietary salt and exercise on salt-sensitive hypertension, which decrease and increase βOHB respectively, indicate that nutritional supplementation of a precursor of βOHB provides a similar benefit to salt-sensitive hypertension as exercise.

Abstract: Summary
During meiosis, crossover recombination promotes the establishment of physical connections between homologous chromosomes, enabling their bipolar segregation. To ensure that persistent recombination intermediates are disengaged prior to the completion of meiosis, the Yen1(GEN1) resolvase is strictly activated at the onset of anaphase II. Whether controlled activation of Yen1 is important for meiotic crossing-over is unknown. Here, we show that CDK-mediated phosphorylation of Yen1 averts its pervasive recruitment to recombination intermediates during prophase I. Yen1 mutants that are refractory to phosphorylation resolve DNA joint molecules prematurely and form crossovers independently of MutLγ, the central crossover resolvase during meiosis. Despite bypassing the requirement for MutLγ in joint molecule processing and promoting crossover-specific resolution, unrestrained Yen1 impairs the spatial distribution of crossover events, genome-wide. Thus, active suppression of Yen1 function, and by inference also of Mus81-Mms4(EME1) and Slx1-Slx4(BTBD12) resolvases, avoids precocious resolution of recombination intermediates to enable meiotic crossover patterning.

Abstract: Summary
Arginine methylation is a post-translational modification that plays pivotal roles in signal transduction and gene transcription during cell fate determination. We found protein methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) to be frequently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its expression to negatively correlate with aggressive cancer features in HCC patients. Silencing of PRMT6 promoted the tumor-initiating, metastasis, and therapy resistance potential of HCC cell lines and patient-derived organoids. Consistently, loss of PRMT6 expression aggravated liver tumorigenesis in a chemical-induced HCC PRMT6 knockout (PRMT6−/−) mouse model. Integrated transcriptome and protein-protein interaction studies revealed an enrichment of genes implicated in RAS signaling and showed that PRMT6 interacted with CRAF on arginine 100, which decreased its RAS binding potential and altered its downstream MEK/ERK signaling. Our work describes a critical repressive function for PRMT6 in maintenance of HCC cells by regulating RAS binding and MEK/ERK signaling via methylation of CRAF on arginine 100.

Abstract: Summary
Adherens junctions are tensile structures that couple epithelial cells together. Junctional tension can arise from cell-intrinsic application of contractility or from the cell-extrinsic forces of tissue movement. Here, we report a mechanosensitive signaling pathway that activates RhoA at adherens junctions to preserve epithelial integrity in response to acute tensile stress. We identify Myosin VI as the force sensor, whose association with E-cadherin is enhanced when junctional tension is increased by mechanical monolayer stress. Myosin VI promotes recruitment of the heterotrimeric Gα12 protein to E-cadherin, where it signals for p114 RhoGEF to activate RhoA. Despite its potential to stimulate junctional actomyosin and further increase contractility, tension-activated RhoA signaling is necessary to preserve epithelial integrity. This is explained by an increase in tensile strength, especially at the multicellular vertices of junctions, that is due to mDia1-mediated actin assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Termination of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription is a key step that is important for 3′ end formation of functional mRNA, mRNA release, and Pol II recycling. Even so, the underlying termination mechanism is not yet understood. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved and essential termination factor Seb1 is found on Pol II near the end of the RNA exit channel and the Rpb4/7 stalk. Furthermore, the Seb1 interaction surface with Pol II largely overlaps with that of the elongation factor Spt5. Notably, Seb1 co-transcriptional recruitment is dependent on Spt5 dephosphorylation by the conserved PP1 phosphatase Dis2, which also dephosphorylates threonine 4 within the Pol II heptad repeated C-terminal domain. We propose that Dis2 orchestrates the transition from elongation to termination phase during the transcription cycle by mediating elongation to termination factor exchange and dephosphorylation of Pol II C-terminal domain.

Abstract: Summary
Cohesin organizes DNA into chromatids, regulates enhancer-promoter interactions, and confers sister chromatid cohesion. Its association with chromosomes is regulated by hook-shaped HEAT repeat proteins that bind Scc1, namely Scc3, Pds5, and Scc2. Unlike Pds5, Scc2 is not a stable cohesin constituent but, as shown here, transiently replaces Pds5. Scc1 mutations that compromise its interaction with Scc2 adversely affect cohesin’s ATPase activity and loading. Moreover, Scc2 mutations that alter how the ATPase responds to DNA abolish loading despite cohesin’s initial association with loading sites. Lastly, Scc2 mutations that permit loading in the absence of Scc4 increase Scc2’s association with chromosomal cohesin and reduce that of Pds5. We suggest that cohesin switches between two states: one with Pds5 bound that is unable to hydrolyze ATP efficiently but is capable of release from chromosomes and another in which Scc2 replaces Pds5 and stimulates ATP hydrolysis necessary for loading and translocation from loading sites.

Abstract: Summary
Proper cochlear hair cell array development and sensory apparatus positioning are achieved by planar cell polarity signaling. Effectors executing proper tissue development and maturation programs are largely unknown. We show that the actin nucleator Cobl is an important effector in postnatal refinement and maintenance of planar cell polarity. During the critical time of hearing onset, these polarity defects coincided with reduced F-actin beneath the sensory apparatus and with premature kinocilium retraction. These defects were accompanied by organizational defects of the pericentriolar scaffold that coincided with basal body and centriolar mispositionings. Importantly, the pericentriolar defects observed in Cobl KO mice were demonstrated to be actin polymerization dependent and calcium/calmodulin signaling dependent. Because Cobl KO phenotypes manifested postnatally, planar cell polarity is not solely an important developmental process. The Cobl-dependent planar cell polarity maintenance and refinement processes we describe here seem critical for hearing, as Cobl KO mice show deficient cochlear amplification.

Abstract: Summary
How cells adapt to varying environmental conditions is largely unknown. Here, we show that, in budding yeast, the RNA-binding and stress granule protein Pub1 has an intrinsic property to form condensates upon starvation or heat stress and that condensate formation is associated with cell-cycle arrest. Release from arrest coincides with condensate dissolution, which takes minutes (starvation) or hours (heat shock). In vitro reconstitution reveals that the different dissolution rates of starvation- and heat-induced condensates are due to their different material properties: starvation-induced Pub1 condensates form by liquid-liquid demixing and subsequently convert into reversible gel-like particles; heat-induced condensates are more solid-like and require chaperones for disaggregation. Our data suggest that different physiological stresses, as well as stress durations and intensities, induce condensates with distinct physical properties and thereby define different modes of stress adaptation and rates of recovery.

Abstract: Summary
Genes specifically expressed in neurons contain members with extended long introns. Longer genes present a problem with respect to fulfilment of gene length transcription, and evidence suggests that dysregulation of long genes is a mechanism underlying neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Here, we report the discovery that RNA-binding protein Sfpq is a critical factor for maintaining transcriptional elongation of long genes. We demonstrate that Sfpq co-transcriptionally binds to long introns and is required for sustaining long-gene transcription by RNA polymerase II through mediating the interaction of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 with the elongation complex. Phenotypically, Sfpq disruption caused neuronal apoptosis in developing mouse brains. Expression analysis of Sfpq-regulated genes revealed specific downregulation of developmentally essential neuronal genes longer than 100 kb in Sfpq-disrupted brains; those genes are enriched in associations with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. The identified molecular machinery yields directions for targeted investigations of the association between long-gene transcriptopathy and neuronal diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Drug resistance represents a major challenge to achieving durable responses to cancer therapeutics. Resistance mechanisms to epigenetically targeted drugs remain largely unexplored. We used bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) inhibition in neuroblastoma as a prototype to model resistance to chromatin modulatory therapeutics. Genome-scale, pooled lentiviral open reading frame (ORF) and CRISPR knockout rescue screens nominated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway as promoting resistance to BET inhibition. Transcriptomic and chromatin profiling of resistant cells revealed that global enhancer remodeling is associated with upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), activation of PI3K signaling, and vulnerability to RTK/PI3K inhibition. Large-scale combinatorial screening with BET inhibitors identified PI3K inhibitors among the most synergistic upfront combinations. These studies provide a roadmap to elucidate resistance to epigenetic-targeted therapeutics and inform efficacious combination therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with changes in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that PINK1 and PARK2 suppressed pancreatic tumorigenesis through control of mitochondrial iron-dependent immunometabolism. Using mouse models of spontaneous pancreatic cancer, we show that depletion of Pink1 and Park2 accelerates mutant Kras-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis. PINK1-PARK2 pathway-mediated degradation of SLC25A37 and SLC25A28 increases mitochondrial iron accumulation, which leads to the HIF1A-dependent Warburg effect and AIM2-dependent inflammasome activation in tumor cells. AIM2-mediated HMGB1 release further induces expression of CD274/PD-L1. Consequently, pharmacological administration of mitochondrial iron chelator, anti-HMGB1 antibody, or genetic depletion of Hif1a or Aim2 in pink1−/− and park2−/− mice confers protection against pancreatic tumorigenesis. Low PARK2 expression and high SLC25A37 and AIM2 expression are associated with poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer. These findings suggest that disrupted mitochondrial iron homeostasis may contribute to cancer development and hence constitute a target for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
It is clear that obesity increases the risk of many types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which obesity is linked to cancer risk remain to be defined. Herein, we report that circulating adipose fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) promotes obesity-associated breast cancer development. Using clinical samples, we demonstrated that circulating A-FABP levels were significantly increased in obese patients with breast cancer in comparison with those without breast cancer. Circulating A-FABP released by adipose tissue directly targeted mammary tumor cells, enhancing tumor stemness and aggressiveness through activation of the IL-6/STAT3/ALDH1 pathway. Importantly, genetic deletion of A-FABP successfully reduced tumor ALHD1 activation and obesity-associated mammary tumor growth and development in different mouse models. Collectively, these data suggest circulating A-FABP as a new link between obesity and breast cancer risk, thereby revealing A-FABP as a potential new therapeutic target for treatment of obesity-associated cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Although macrophages are armed with potent antibacterial functions, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) replicates inside these innate immune cells. Determinants of macrophage intrinsic bacterial control, and the Mtb strategies to overcome them, are poorly understood. To further study these processes, we used an affinity tag purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) approach to identify 187 Mtb-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving 34 secreted Mtb proteins. This interaction map revealed two factors involved in Mtb pathogenesis—the secreted Mtb protein, LpqN, and its binding partner, the human ubiquitin ligase CBL. We discovered that an lpqN Mtb mutant is attenuated in macrophages, but growth is restored when CBL is removed. Conversely, Cbl−/− macrophages are resistant to viral infection, indicating that CBL regulates cell-intrinsic polarization between antibacterial and antiviral immunity. Collectively, these findings illustrate the utility of this Mtb-human PPI map for developing a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions between Mtb and its host.

Abstract: The up-regulation of HLA antigens is important during heart inflammatory events and myofibroblasts may modulate the expression of this molecule in tissues. To test this possibility, the effect of cardiac myofibroblast:macrophage contact and the production of myofibroblast inhibitor factor(s) on the macrophage HLA (Ia) expression were studied. Listeria monocytogenes-elicited Ia + peritoneal macrophages (high Ia expression) were co-cultured with cardiac myofibroblasts for 3 and 7 days (myofibroblast contact). Proteosa peptone-elicited macrophages (low Ia expression) were cultured for 3 days with interferon gamma (INF-γ) and myofibroblast conditioned medium (FCM). Ia expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence and by radioimmune assay. Myofibroblast contact induced decreased expression of Ia molecule on macrophages (p < 0.001). This was confirmed by the radioimmune analysis in macrophage: myofibroblast co-cultures (p < 0.001). Double staining for Ia and CD14 showed that only CD14 positive cells (macrophages) expressed Ia molecule. FCM was capable of diminishing Ia expression induced by INF-γ on macrophages (p < 0.001). Decreased Ia macrophage expression induced by myofibroblasts could be important in the heart inflammation’s resolution, probably involving Ia redistribution on cell: cell contact and myofibroblast inhibitor factor production.

Abstract: Summary
All biological populations are to a greater or lesser degree evolvable, but the forces that shape evolvability, especially the evolution of evolvability as an adaptive response to pressure to evolve rapidly, are a source of controversy. One determinant of evolvability is the set of possible mutations available to a genotype, or “mutational neighborhood.” A benign (instead of deleterious) mutational neighborhood can enhance evolvability. Whether selection for evolvability itself can result in a more benign mutational neighborhood remains an open question. We document the evolution of increased evolvability in a fluctuating environment despite using a regime that precludes, by design, the adaptive evolution of evolvability. Instead, a benign mutational neighborhood arises as a byproduct of transiently elevated error rates via a mechanism that we call emergent evolutionary capacitance. This is evolutionary capacitance similar to that seen in a model system for capacitance, the yeast prion [PSI+], but without a capacitor.

Abstract: Summary
Cells respond to various extracellular stimuli through a limited number of signaling pathways. One strategy to process such stimuli is to code the information into the temporal patterns of molecules. Although we showed that insulin selectively regulated molecules depending on its temporal patterns using Fao cells, the in vivo mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show how the insulin-AKT pathway processes the information encoded into the temporal patterns of blood insulin. We performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments and found that, in the liver, all temporal patterns of insulin are encoded into the insulin receptor, and downstream molecules selectively decode them through AKT. S6K selectively decodes the additional secretion information. G6Pase interprets the basal secretion information through FoxO1, while GSK3β decodes all secretion pattern information. Mathematical modeling revealed the mechanism via differences in network structures and from sensitivity and time constants. Given that almost all hormones exhibit distinct temporal patterns, temporal coding may be a general principle of system homeostasis by hormones.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular proteostasis is maintained via the coordinated synthesis, maintenance, and breakdown of proteins in the cytosol and organelles. While biogenesis of the mitochondrial membrane complexes that execute oxidative phosphorylation depends on cytoplasmic translation, it is unknown how translation within mitochondria impacts cytoplasmic proteostasis and nuclear gene expression. Here we have analyzed the effects of mutations in the highly conserved accuracy center of the yeast mitoribosome. Decreased accuracy of mitochondrial translation shortened chronological lifespan, impaired management of cytosolic protein aggregates, and elicited a general transcriptional stress response. In striking contrast, increased accuracy extended lifespan, improved cytosolic aggregate clearance, and suppressed a normally stress-induced, Msn2/4-dependent interorganellar proteostasis transcription program (IPTP) that regulates genes important for mitochondrial proteostasis. Collectively, the data demonstrate that cytosolic protein homeostasis and nuclear stress signaling are controlled by mitochondrial translation efficiency in an inter-connected organelle quality control network that determines cellular lifespan.

Abstract: Summary
Deviating from the normal karyotype dramatically changes gene dosage, in turn decreasing the robustness of biological networks. Consequently, aneuploidy is poorly tolerated by normal somatic cells and acts as a barrier to transformation. Paradoxically, however, karyotype heterogeneity drives tumor evolution and the emergence of therapeutic drug resistance. To better understand how cancer cells tolerate aneuploidy, we focused on the p38 stress response kinase. We show here that p38-deficient cells upregulate glycolysis and avoid post-mitotic apoptosis, leading to the emergence of aneuploid subclones. We also show that p38 deficiency upregulates the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor Hif-1α and that inhibiting Hif-1α restores apoptosis in p38-deficent cells. Because hypoxia and aneuploidy are both barriers to tumor progression, the ability of Hif-1α to promote cell survival following chromosome missegregation raises the possibility that aneuploidy tolerance coevolves with adaptation to hypoxia.

Abstract: Summary
Interphase chromatin is organized into topologically associating domains (TADs). Within TADs, chromatin looping interactions are formed between DNA regulatory elements, but their functional importance for the establishment of the 3D genome organization and gene regulation during development is unclear. Using high-resolution Hi-C experiments, we analyze higher order 3D chromatin organization during Drosophila embryogenesis and identify active and repressive chromatin loops that are established with different kinetics and depend on distinct factors: Zelda-dependent active loops are formed before the midblastula transition between transcribed genes over long distances. Repressive loops within polycomb domains are formed after the midblastula transition between polycomb response elements by the action of GAGA factor and polycomb proteins. Perturbation of PRE function by CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering affects polycomb domain formation and destabilizes polycomb-mediated silencing. Preventing loop formation without removal of polycomb components also decreases silencing efficiency, suggesting that chromatin architecture can play instructive roles in gene regulation during development.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to form specific cell-cell connections within complex cellular environments is critical for multicellular organisms. However, the underlying mechanisms of cell matching that instruct these connections remain elusive. Here, we quantitatively explored the dynamics and regulation of cell matching processes utilizing Drosophila cardiogenesis. We found that cell matching is highly robust at boundaries between cardioblast (CB) subtypes, and filopodia of different CB subtypes have distinct binding affinities. Cdc42 is involved in regulating this selective filopodia binding adhesion and influences CB matching. Further, we identified adhesion molecules Fasciclin III (Fas3) and Ten-m, both of which also regulate synaptic targeting, as having complementary differential expression in CBs. Altering Fas3 expression changes differential filopodia adhesion and leads to CB mismatch. Furthermore, only when both Fas3 and Ten-m are lost is CB alignment severely impaired. Our results show that differential adhesion mediated by selective filopodia binding efficiently regulates precise and robust cell matching.

Abstract: Summary
For decades, it has been thought that glutamate and GABA are released by distinct neurons. However, some mouse neurons innervating the lateral habenula (LHb) co-release glutamate and GABA. Here, we mapped the distribution of neurons throughout the rat brain that co-express vesicular transporters for the accumulation of glutamate (VGluT2) or GABA (VGaT) and for GABA synthesis (GAD). We found concentrated groups of neurons that co-express VGluT2, VGaT, and GAD mRNAs within subdivisions of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), entopeduncular (EPN), and supramammillary (SUM) nuclei. Single axon terminals established by VTA, EPN, or SUM neurons form a common synaptic architecture involving asymmetric (putative excitatory) and symmetric (putative inhibitory) synapses. Within the LHb, which receives co-transmitted glutamate and GABA from VTA and EPN, VGluT2 and VGaT are distributed on separate synaptic vesicles. We conclude that single axon terminals from VGluT2 and VGaT co-expressing neurons co-transmit glutamate and GABA from distinct synaptic vesicles at independent synapses.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental neuronal remodeling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism required for precise wiring of nervous systems. Despite its fundamental role in neurodevelopment and proposed contribution to various neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we uncover the fine temporal transcriptional landscape of Drosophila mushroom body γ neurons undergoing stereotypical remodeling. Our data reveal rapid and dramatic changes in the transcriptional landscape during development. Focusing on DNA binding proteins, we identify eleven that are required for remodeling. Furthermore, we sequence developing γ neurons perturbed for three key transcription factors required for pruning. We describe a hierarchical network featuring positive and negative feedback loops. Superimposing the perturbation-seq on the developmental expression atlas highlights a framework of transcriptional modules that together drive remodeling. Overall, this study provides a broad and detailed molecular insight into the complex regulatory dynamics of developmental remodeling and thus offers a pipeline to dissect developmental processes via RNA profiling.

Abstract: Summary
Human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (hOPCs) persist into adulthood as an abundant precursor population capable of division and differentiation. The transcriptional mechanisms that regulate hOPC homeostasis remain poorly defined. Herein, we identify paired related homeobox protein 1 (PRRX1) in primary PDGFαR+ hOPCs. We show that enforced PRRX1 expression results in reversible G1/0 arrest. While both PRRX1 splice variants reduce hOPC proliferation, only PRRX1a abrogates migration. hOPC engraftment into hypomyelinated shiverer/rag2 mouse brain is severely impaired by PRRX1a, characterized by reduced cell proliferation and migration. PRRX1 induces a gene expression signature characteristic of stem cell quiescence. Both IFN-γ and BMP signaling upregulate PRRX1 and induce quiescence. PRRX1 knockdown modulates IFN-γ-induced quiescence. In mouse brain, PRRX1 mRNA was detected in non-dividing OPCs and is upregulated in OPCs following demyelination. Together, these data identify PRRX1 as a regulator of quiescence in hOPCs and as a potential regulator of pathological quiescence.

Abstract: Summary
Altered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer growth, forming the conceptual basis for development of metabolic therapies as cancer treatments. We performed in vivo metabolic profiling and molecular analysis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to identify metabolic nodes for therapeutic targeting. Lung SCCs adapt to chronic mTOR inhibition and suppression of glycolysis through the GSK3α/β signaling pathway, which upregulates glutaminolysis. Phospho-GSK3α/β protein levels are predictive of response to single-therapy mTOR inhibition while combinatorial treatment with the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 effectively overcomes therapy resistance. In addition, we identified a conserved metabolic signature in a broad spectrum of hypermetabolic human tumors that may be predictive of patient outcome and response to combined metabolic therapies targeting mTOR and glutaminase.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase (pol) III transcribes a variety of small untranslated RNAs involved in transcription, RNA processing, and translation. RNA pol III and its components are altered in various human developmental disorders, yet their roles in cell fate determination and development are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that Maf1, a transcriptional repressor, promotes induction of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into mesoderm. Reduced Maf1 expression in mESCs and preadipocytes impairs adipogenesis, while ectopic Maf1 expression in Maf1-deficient cells enhances differentiation. RNA pol III repression by chemical inhibition or knockdown of Brf1 promotes adipogenesis. Altered RNA pol III-dependent transcription produces select changes in mRNAs with a significant enrichment of adipogenic gene signatures. Furthermore, RNA pol III-mediated transcription positively regulates long non-coding RNA H19 and Wnt6 expression, established adipogenesis inhibitors. Together, these studies reveal an important and unexpected function for RNA pol III-mediated transcription and Maf1 in mesoderm induction and adipocyte differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in BLM helicase predispose Bloom syndrome (BS) patients to a wide spectrum of cancers. We demonstrate that MIB1-ubiquitylated BLM in G1 phase functions as an adaptor protein by enhancing the binding of transcription factor c-Jun and its E3 ligase, Fbw7α. BLM enhances the K48/K63-linked ubiquitylation on c-Jun, thereby enhancing the rate of its subsequent degradation. Functionally defective Fbw7α mutants prevalent in multiple human cancers are reactivated by BLM. However, BS patient-derived BLM mutants cannot potentiate Fbw7α-dependent c-Jun degradation. The decrease in the levels of c-Jun in cells expressing BLM prevents effective c-Jun binding to 2,584 gene promoters. This causes decreases in the transcript and protein levels of c-Jun targets in BLM-expressing cells, resulting in attenuated c-Jun-dependent effects during neoplastic transformation. Thus, BLM carries out its function as a tumor suppressor by enhancing c-Jun turnover and thereby preventing its activity as a proto-oncogene.

Protein transport into the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is mediated by the heterotrimeric Sec61 channel. The signal recognition particle (SRP) and TRC systems and Sec62 have all been characterized as membrane-targeting components for small presecretory proteins, whereas Sec63 and the lumenal chaperone BiP act as auxiliary translocation components. Here, we report the transport requirements of two natural, small presecretory proteins and engineered variants using semipermeabilized human cells after the depletion of specific ER components. Our results suggest that hSnd2, Sec62, and SRP and TRC receptor each provide alternative targeting pathways for short secretory proteins and define rules of engagement for the actions of Sec63 and BiP during their membrane translocation. We find that the Sec62/Sec63 complex plus BiP can facilitate Sec61 channel opening, thereby allowing precursors that have weak signal peptides or other inhibitory features to translocate. A Sec61 inhibitor can mimic the effect of BiP depletion on Sec61 gating, suggesting that they both act at the same essential membrane translocation step.

Abstract: Summary
Amyloids are fibrous protein assemblies that are often described as irreversible and intrinsically pathogenic. However, yeast cells employ amyloid-like assemblies of the RNA-binding protein Rim4 to control translation during meiosis. Here, we show that multi-site phosphorylation of Rim4 is critical for its regulated disassembly and degradation and that failure to clear Rim4 assemblies interferes with meiotic progression. Furthermore, we identify the protein kinase Ime2 to bring about Rim4 clearance via phosphorylation of Rim4's intrinsically disordered region. Rim4 phosphorylation leads to reversal of its amyloid-like properties and degradation by the proteasome. Our data support a model in which a threshold amount of phosphorylation, rather than modification of critical residues, is required for Rim4 clearance. Our results further demonstrate that at least some amyloid-like assemblies are not as irreversible as previously thought. We propose that the natural pathways by which cells process these structures could be deployed to act on disease-related amyloids.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal function relies on precisely organized neurons and synapses and a properly patterned vasculature to support them. Alterations in these features can result in vision loss. However, our understanding of retinal organization pathways remains incomplete because of a lack of methods to rapidly identify neuron and vasculature regulators in mammals. Here we developed a pipeline for the identification of neural and synaptic integrity genes by high-throughput retinal screening (INSiGHT) that analyzes candidate expression, vascular patterning, cellular organization, and synaptic arrangement. Using this system, we examined 102 mutant mouse lines and identified 16 unique retinal regulatory genes. Fifteen of these candidates are identified as novel retina regulators, and many (9 of 16) are associated with human neural diseases. These results expand the genetic landscape involved in retinal circuit organization and provide a road map for continued discovery of mammalian retinal regulators and disease-causing alleles.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication introduces a dosage imbalance between early and late replicating genes. In budding yeast, buffering gene expression against this imbalance depends on marking replicated DNA by H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac). Whether additional processes are required for suppressing transcription from H3K56ac-labeled DNA remains unknown. Here, using a database-guided candidate screen, we find that COMPASS, the H3K4 methyltransferase, and its upstream effector, PAF1C, act downstream of H3K56ac to buffer expression. Replicated genes show reduced abundance of the transcription activating mark H3K4me3 and accumulate the transcription inhibitory mark H3K4me2 near transcription start sites. Notably, in hydroxyurea-exposed cells, the S phase checkpoint stabilizes H3K56ac and becomes essential for buffering. We suggest that H3K56ac suppresses transcription of replicated genes by interfering with post-replication recovery of epigenetic marks and assign a new function for the S phase checkpoint in stabilizing this mechanism during persistent dosage imbalance.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrients are not only organic compounds fueling bioenergetics and biosynthesis, but also key chemical signals controlling growth and metabolism. Nutrients enormously impact the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play essential roles in normal physiology and diseases. How nutrient signaling is integrated with redox regulation is an interesting, but not fully understood, question. Herein, we report that superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is a conserved component of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) nutrient signaling. mTORC1 regulates SOD1 activity through reversible phosphorylation at S39 in yeast and T40 in humans in response to nutrients, which moderates ROS level and prevents oxidative DNA damage. We further show that SOD1 activation enhances cancer cell survival and tumor formation in the ischemic tumor microenvironment and protects against the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Collectively, these findings identify a conserved mechanism by which eukaryotes dynamically regulate redox homeostasis in response to changing nutrient conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Lnk/Sh2b3 is an adaptor protein that negatively regulates cytokine signaling in lymphohematopoiesis. A missense variant within the LNK/SH2B3 gene has been reported to be a risk variant for several autoimmune diseases, including diabetes. We found that glucose tolerance and insulin responses were impaired in Lnk−/− mice. Moreover, immune cells such as group 1 innate lymphoid cells (G1-ILCs), CD8+ T cells, and M1 macrophages accumulated in adipose tissue. When Lnk−/− mice were crossed with Il15−/− mice or depleted of G1-ILCs but not CD8+ T cells, glucose intolerance and adipose inflammation were ameliorated. Lnk−/− G1-ILCs showed activated phenotypes as well as enhanced reactivity for IL-15, and administration of a JAK inhibitor improved glucose tolerance. Accordingly, a high-fat diet greatly worsened glucose intolerance in Lnk−/− mice. Thus, Lnk/Sh2b3 controls homeostasis in adipose tissue and reduces the risk of onset of diabetes by regulating the expansion and activation of IL-15-dependent adipose G1-ILCs.

Abstract: Summary
Esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB) is a rare cancer of the olfactory mucosa, with no established molecular stratification to date. We report similarities of ENB with tumors arising in the neural crest and perform integrative analysis of these tumors. We propose a molecular-based subtype classification of ENB as basal or neural, both of which have distinct pathological, transcriptomic, proteomic, and immune features. Among the basal subtype, we uncovered an IDH2 R172 mutant-enriched subgroup (∼35%) harboring a CpG island methylator phenotype reminiscent of IDH2 mutant gliomas. Compared with the basal ENB methylome, the neural ENB methylome shows genome-wide reprogramming with loss of DNA methylation at the enhancers of axonal guidance genes. Our study reveals insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ENB and provides classification information of potential therapeutic relevance.

Abstract: Summary
Immune recognition of tumor-expressed antigens by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells is the foundation of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) and has been shown to elicit significant tumor regression. However, therapy-induced selective pressure can sculpt the antigenicity of tumors, resulting in outgrowth of variants that lose the target antigen. We demonstrate that tumor relapse from ACT and subsequent oncolytic viral vaccination can be prevented using class I HDACi, MS-275. Drug delivery subverted the phenotype of tumor-infiltrating CD11b+ Ly6Chi Ly6G– myeloid cells, favoring NOS2/ROS secretion and pro-inflammatory genes characteristic of M1 polarization. Simultaneously, MS-275 abrogated the immunosuppressive function of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and reprogrammed them to eliminate antigen-negative tumor cells in a caspase-dependent manner. Elevated IFN-γ within the tumor microenvironment suggests that MS-275 modulates the local cytokine landscape to favor antitumor myeloid polarization through the IFN-γR/STAT1 signaling axis. Exploiting tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell plasticity thus complements T cell therapy in targeting tumor heterogeneity and immune escape.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue virus (DENV) is a major human pathogen causing millions of infections yearly. Despite intensive investigations, a DENV receptor that directly participates in virus internalization has not yet been characterized. Here, we report that the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM-1 is an authentic DENV entry receptor that plays an active role in virus endocytosis. Genetic ablation of TIM-1 strongly impaired DENV infection. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy analyses of live infected cells show that TIM-1 is mostly confined in clathrin-coated pits and is co-internalized with DENV during viral entry. TIM-1 is ubiquitinated at two lysine residues of its cytoplasmic domain, and this modification is required for DENV endocytosis. Furthermore, STAM-1, a component of the ESCRT-0 complex involved in intracellular trafficking of ubiquitinated cargos, interacts with TIM-1 and is required for DENV infection. Overall, our results show that TIM-1 is the first bona fide receptor identified for DENV.

Abstract: Summary
The gut absorbs dietary nutrients and provides a barrier to xenobiotics and microbiome metabolites. To cope with toxin exposures, the intestinal epithelium is one of the most rapidly proliferating tissues in the body. The stem cell niche supplies essential signaling factors including Wnt proteins secreted by subepithelial myofibroblasts. Unexpectedly, therapeutically effective doses of orally administered PORCN inhibitors that block all Wnt secretion do not affect intestinal homeostasis. We find that intestinal myofibroblasts are intrinsically resistant to multiple xenobiotics, including PORCN inhibitors and the anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin. These myofibroblasts have high expression of a subset of drug transporters; knockout of Mrp1/Abcc1 enhances drug sensitivity. Tamoxifen administration to Rosa26CreERT2;mT/mG mice visually highlights the drug-resistant intestinal stromal compartment and identifies small populations of drug-resistant cells in lung, kidney, and pancreatic islets. Xenobiotic resistance of the Wnt-producing myofibroblasts can protect the intestinal stem cell niche in the face of an unpredictable environment.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are key players in the regulation of T cell biology by dynamically responding to cell needs, but how these dynamics integrate in T cells is still poorly understood. We show here that the mitochondrial pro-fission protein Drp1 fosters migration and expansion of developing thymocytes both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we find that Drp1 sustains in vitro clonal expansion and cMyc-dependent metabolic reprogramming upon activation, also regulating effector T cell numbers in vivo. Migration and extravasation defects are also exhibited in Drp1-deficient mature T cells, unveiling its crucial role in controlling both T cell recirculation in secondary lymphoid organs and accumulation at tumor sites. Moreover, the observed Drp1-dependent imbalance toward a memory-like phenotype favors T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment. All of these findings support a crucial role for Drp1 in several processes during T cell development and in anti-tumor immune-surveillance.

Abstract: Summary
The role of fatty acid synthesis in endothelial cells (ECs) remains incompletely characterized. We report that fatty acid synthase knockdown (FASNKD) in ECs impedes vessel sprouting by reducing proliferation. Endothelial loss of FASN impaired angiogenesis in vivo, while FASN blockade reduced pathological ocular neovascularization, at >10-fold lower doses than used for anti-cancer treatment. Impaired angiogenesis was not due to energy stress, redox imbalance, or palmitate depletion. Rather, FASNKD elevated malonyl-CoA levels, causing malonylation (a post-translational modification) of mTOR at lysine 1218 (K1218). mTOR K-1218 malonylation impaired mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase activity, thereby reducing phosphorylation of downstream targets (p70S6K/4EBP1). Silencing acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (an enzyme producing malonyl-CoA) normalized malonyl-CoA levels and reactivated mTOR in FASNKD ECs. Mutagenesis unveiled the importance of mTOR K1218 malonylation for angiogenesis. This study unveils a novel role of FASN in metabolite signaling that contributes to explaining the anti-angiogenic effect of FASN blockade.

Abstract: Summary
A subset of viral genes is required for the long-term latent infection of hematopoietic cells by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Here, we show that a latency-associated gene product (LUNA) promotes the disruption of cellular PML bodies during latency. Mutation and inhibitor studies reveal that LUNA encodes a deSUMOylase activity responsible for this disruption. Specifically, LUNA encodes a conserved Asp-Cys-Gly motif common to all deSUMOylases. Importantly, mutation of the putative catalytic cysteine is sufficient to reverse LUNA-mediated PML dispersal and markedly reduces the efficiency of viral reactivation. The depletion of PML from cells is sufficient to rescue the reactivation of the LUNA-deficient viruses, arguing that targeting PML is an important biological role of LUNA. Finally, we demonstrate that reactivation of naturally latent HCMV is blocked by deSUMOylase inhibitors. Thus, latent HCMV primes the cellular environment for efficient reactivation via the activity of a virally encoded deSUMOylase.

Abstract: Cilia are highly specialized antennae-like organelles that extend from the cell surface and act as cell signaling hubs. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a specialized form of intracellular protein trafficking that is required for the assembly and maintenance of cilia. Because cilia are so important, mutations in several IFT components lead to human disease. Thus, clarifying the molecular functions of the IFT proteins is a high priority in cilia biology. Live imaging in various species and cellular preparations has proven to be an important technique in both the discovery of IFT and the mechanisms by which it functions. Live imaging of Drosophila cilia, however, has not yet been reported. Here, we have visualized the movement of IFT in Drosophila cilia using time-lapse live imaging for the first time. We found that NOMPB-GFP (IFT88) moves according to distinct parameters depending on the ciliary segment. NOMPB-GFP moves at a similar speed in proximal and distal cilia toward the tip (~0.45 μm/s). As it returns to the ciliary base, however, NOMPB-GFP moves at ~0.12 μm/s in distal cilia, accelerating to ~0.70 μm/s in proximal cilia. Furthermore, while live imaging NOMPB-GFP, we observed one of the IFT proteins required for retrograde movement, Oseg4 (WDR35), is also required for anterograde movement in distal cilia. We anticipate our time-lapse live imaging analysis technique in Drosophila cilia will be a good starting point for a more sophisticated analysis of IFT and its molecular mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin remodeling complexes play essential roles in metazoan development through widespread control of gene expression, but the precise molecular mechanisms by which they do this in vivo remain ill defined. Using an inducible system with fine temporal resolution, we show that the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex controls chromatin architecture and the protein binding repertoire at regulatory regions during cell state transitions. This is primarily exerted through its nucleosome remodeling activity while deacetylation at H3K27 follows changes in gene expression. Additionally, NuRD activity influences association of RNA polymerase II at transcription start sites and subsequent nascent transcript production, thereby guiding the establishment of lineage-appropriate transcriptional programs. These findings provide a detailed molecular picture of genome-wide modulation of lineage-specific transcription by an essential chromatin remodeling complex as well as insight into the orchestration of molecular events involved in transcriptional transitions in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
B cell fate decisions within a germinal center (GC) are critical to determining the outcome of the immune response to a given antigen. Here, we characterize GC kinetics and B cell fate choices in a response to the autoantigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and compare the response with a standard model foreign antigen. Both antigens generate productive primary responses, as evidenced by GC development, circulating antigen-specific antibodies, and differentiation of memory B cells. However, in the MOG response, the status of the cognate T cell partner drives preferential B cell differentiation to a memory phenotype at the expense of GC maintenance, resulting in a truncated GC. Reduced plasma cell differentiation is largely independent of T cell influence. Interestingly, memory-phenotype B cells formed in the MOG GC are not long lived, resulting in a failure of the B cell response to secondary challenge.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying the earliest somatic changes in prostate cancer can give important insights into tumor evolution and aids in stratifying high- from low-risk disease. We integrated whole genome, transcriptome and methylome analysis of early-onset prostate cancers (diagnosis ≤55 years). Characterization across 292 prostate cancer genomes revealed age-related genomic alterations and a clock-like enzymatic-driven mutational process contributing to the earliest mutations in prostate cancer patients. Our integrative analysis identified four molecular subgroups, including a particularly aggressive subgroup with recurrent duplications associated with increased expression of ESRP1, which we validate in 12,000 tissue microarray tumors. Finally, we combined the patterns of molecular co-occurrence and risk-based subgroup information to deconvolve the molecular and clinical trajectories of prostate cancer from single patient samples.

Abstract: Summary
Hard-to-replicate regions of chromosomes (e.g., pericentromeres, centromeres, and telomeres) impede replication fork progression, eventually leading, in the event of replication stress, to chromosome fragility, aging, and cancer. Our knowledge of the mechanisms controlling the stability of these regions is essentially limited to telomeres, where fragility is counteracted by the shelterin proteins. Here we show that the shelterin subunit TRF2 ensures progression of the replication fork through pericentromeric heterochromatin, but not centromeric chromatin. In a process involving its N-terminal basic domain, TRF2 binds to pericentromeric Satellite III sequences during S phase, allowing the recruitment of the G-quadruplex-resolving helicase RTEL1 to facilitate fork progression. We also show that TRF2 is required for the stability of other heterochromatic regions localized throughout the genome, paving the way for future research on heterochromatic replication and its relationship with aging and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Liver tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells migrate throughout the sinusoids and are capable of protecting against malaria sporozoite challenge. To gain an understanding of liver Trm cell development, we examined various conditions for their formation. Although liver Trm cells were found in naive mice, their presence was dictated by antigen specificity and required IL-15. Liver Trm cells also formed after adoptive transfer of in vitro-activated but not naive CD8+ T cells, indicating that activation was essential but that antigen presentation within the liver was not obligatory. These Trm cells patrolled the liver sinusoids with a half-life of 36 days and occupied a large niche that could be added to sequentially without effect on subsequent Trm cell cohorts. Together, our findings indicate that liver Trm cells form as a normal consequence of CD8+ T cell activation during essentially any infection but that inflammatory and antigenic signals preferentially tailor their development.

Abstract: Summary
Genomes are promiscuously transcribed, necessitating mechanisms that facilitate the sorting of RNA for function or destruction. The polyA (pA) tail is one such distinguishing feature, which in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nucleus is bound by the Nab2p protein, yielding transcript protection. As Nab2p also contacts the main nuclear export factor Mex67p, we asked whether transport kinetics contributes to RNA sorting. Indeed, 3′ end sequencing of newly transcribed pA+ RNAs demonstrates that nuclear depletion of Mex67p elicits their instant and global decay. A similar phenotype is evident upon inactivation of other export factors and proportional to the amount of nuclear pA+ RNA. As RNA expression is partially rescued by Nab2p overexpression, we propose that an export block out-titrates Nab2p onto nuclear-retained pA+ RNA, reducing the pool of Nab2p available to protect new transcripts. More generally, we suggest that nuclear RNA decay, negotiated by Nab2p availability, aids in balancing cellular transcript supply with demand.

Abstract: Summary
Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems provide adaptive immunity by integrating portions of foreign nucleic acids (spacers) into genomic CRISPR arrays. Cas6 proteins then process CRISPR array transcripts into spacer-derived RNAs (CRISPR RNAs; crRNAs) that target Cas nucleases to matching invaders. We find that a Marinomonas mediterranea fusion protein combines three enzymatic domains (Cas6, reverse transcriptase [RT], and Cas1), which function in both crRNA biogenesis and spacer acquisition from RNA and DNA. We report a crystal structure of this divergent Cas6, identify amino acids required for Cas6 activity, show that the Cas6 domain is required for RT activity and RNA spacer acquisition, and demonstrate that CRISPR-repeat binding to Cas6 regulates RT activity. Co-evolution of putative interacting surfaces suggests a specific structural interaction between the Cas6 and RT domains, and phylogenetic analysis reveals repeated, stable association of free-standing Cas6s with CRISPR RTs in multiple microbial lineages, indicating that a functional interaction between these proteins preceded evolution of the fusion.

Abstract: Summary
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) endows carcinoma cells with traits needed to complete many of the steps leading to metastasis formation, but its contributions specifically to the late step of extravasation remain understudied. We find that breast cancer cells that have undergone an EMT extravasate more efficiently from blood vessels both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of gene expression changes associated with the EMT program led to the identification of an EMT-induced cell-surface protein, podocalyxin (PODXL), as a key mediator of extravasation in mesenchymal breast and pancreatic carcinoma cells. PODXL promotes extravasation through direct interaction of its intracellular domain with the cytoskeletal linker protein ezrin. Ezrin proceeds to establish dorsal cortical polarity, enabling the transition of cancer cells from a non-polarized, rounded cell morphology to an invasive extravasation-competent shape. Hence, the EMT program can directly enhance the efficiency of extravasation and subsequent metastasis formation through a PODXL-ezrin signaling axis.

Abstract: Summary
Cells need to reliably control their proteome composition to maintain homeostasis and regulate growth. How protein synthesis and degradation interplay to control protein expression levels remains unclear. Here, we combined a tandem fluorescent timer and pulse-chase protein labeling to disentangle how protein synthesis and degradation control protein homeostasis in single live mouse embryonic stem cells. We discovered substantial cell-cycle dependence in protein synthesis rates and stabilization of a large number of proteins around cytokinesis. Protein degradation rates were highly variable between cells, co-varied within individual cells for different proteins, and were positively correlated with synthesis rates. This suggests variability in proteasome activity as an important source of global extrinsic noise in gene expression. Our approach paves the way toward understanding the complex interplay of synthesis and degradation processes in determining protein levels of individual mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFNs) are central components of the antiviral response. Most cell types respond to viral infections by secreting IFNs, but the mechanisms that regulate correct expression of these cytokines are not completely understood. Here, we show that activation of the type I IFN response regulates the expression of miRNAs in a post-transcriptional manner. Activation of IFN expression alters the binding of the Microprocessor complex to pri-miRNAs, reducing its processing rate and thus leading to decreased levels of a subset of mature miRNAs in an IRF3-dependent manner. The rescue of Microprocessor function during the antiviral response downregulates the levels of IFN-β and IFN-stimulated genes. All these findings support a model by which the inhibition of Microprocessor activity is an essential step to induce a robust type I IFN response in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
By functioning as an enzyme cofactor, hemoglobin component, and gene regulator, heme is vital for life. One mode of heme-regulated transcription involves amplifying the activity of GATA-1, a key determinant of erythrocyte differentiation. To discover biological consequences of the metal cofactor-transcription factor mechanism, we merged GATA-1/heme-regulated sectors of the proteome and transcriptome. This multi-omic analysis revealed a GATA-1/heme circuit involving hemoglobin subunits, ubiquitination components, and proteins not implicated in erythrocyte biology, including the zinc exporter Slc30a1. Though GATA-1 induced expression of Slc30a1 and the zinc importer Slc39a8, Slc39a8 dominantly increased intracellular zinc, which conferred erythroblast survival. Subsequently, a zinc transporter switch, involving decreased importer and sustained exporter expression, reduced intracellular zinc during terminal differentiation. Downregulating Slc30a1 increased intracellular zinc and, strikingly, accelerated differentiation. This analysis established a conserved paradigm in which a GATA-1/heme circuit controls trace metal transport machinery and trace metal levels as a mechanism governing cellular differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has proven clinically beneficial against B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. However, suboptimal clinical outcomes have been associated with decreased expansion and persistence of adoptively transferred CAR T cells, antigen-negative relapses, and impairment by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Improvements in CAR T cell design are required to enhance clinical efficacy, as well as broaden the applicability of this technology. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin-18 (IL-18)-secreting CAR T cells exhibit enhanced in vivo expansion and persistence and significantly increase long-term survival in syngeneic mouse models of both hematological and solid malignancies. In addition, we demonstrate that IL-18-secreting CAR T cells are capable of modulating the tumor microenvironment, as well as enhancing an effective endogenous anti-tumor immune response. IL-18-secreting CAR T cells represent a promising strategy to enhance the clinical outcomes of adoptive T cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The microenvironment shapes cell behavior and determines metastatic outcomes of tumors. We addressed how microenvironmental cues control tumor cell invasion in pediatric medulloblastoma (MB). We show that bFGF promotes MB tumor cell invasion through FGF receptor (FGFR) in vitro and that blockade of FGFR represses brain tissue infiltration in vivo. TGF-β regulates pro-migratory bFGF function in a context-dependent manner. Under low bFGF, the non-canonical TGF-β pathway causes ROCK activation and cortical translocation of ERK1/2, which antagonizes FGFR signaling by inactivating FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2), and promotes a contractile, non-motile phenotype. Under high bFGF, negative-feedback regulation of FRS2 by bFGF-induced ERK1/2 causes repression of the FGFR pathway. Under these conditions, TGF-β counters inactivation of FRS2 and restores pro-migratory signaling. These findings pinpoint coincidence detection of bFGF and TGF-β signaling by FRS2 as a mechanism that controls tumor cell invasion. Thus, targeting FRS2 represents an emerging strategy to abrogate aberrant FGFR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Although human ZMYND8 has been implicated as a transcriptional co-repressor of multiple targets, global association of ZMYND8 with active genes and enhancer regions predicts otherwise. Here, we report an additional function of ZMYND8 in transcriptional activation through its association with the P-TEFb complex. Biochemical reconstitution analyses show that human ZMYND8, through direct association with CylcinT1, forms a minimal ZMYND8-P-TEFb complex. The importance of ZMYND8 in target gene activation, through P-TEFb complex recruitment, is demonstrated on chromosomally integrated reporter gene as well as native target genes in vivo. Physiologically, we further show that the ZMYND8-P-TEFb complex-mediated transcriptional activation is required for all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated differentiation of neuronal precursor cells. Finally, to detail the dual activator and repressor nature, mechanistically we show that, through its putative coiled-coil domain, ZMYND8 forms a homodimer that preferentially associates with the activator P-TEFb complex, whereas the monomer associates with the CHD4 subunit of repressor NuRD complex.

Abstract: The inner ear is a complex sensory organ responsible for hearing and balance. Formation of the inner ear is dependent on tight regulation of spatial and temporal expression of genes that direct a series of developmental processes. Recently, epigenetic regulation has emerged as a crucial regulator of the development of various organs. However, what roles higher-order chromatin organization and its regulator molecules play in inner ear development are unclear. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a highly conserved 11-zinc finger protein that regulates the three-dimensional architecture of chromatin, and is involved in various gene regulation processes. To delineate the role of CTCF in inner ear development, the present study investigated inner ear-specific Ctcf knockout mouse embryos (Pax2-Cre; Ctcffl/fl). The loss of Ctcf resulted in multiple defects of inner ear development and severely compromised otic neurogenesis, which was partly due to a loss of Neurog1 expression. Furthermore, reduced Neurog1 gene expression by CTCF knockdown was found to be associated with changes in histone modification at the gene’s promoter, as well as its upstream enhancer. The results of the present study demonstrate that CTCF plays an essential role in otic neurogenesis by modulating histone modification in the Neurog1 locus.

Abstract: The advent of massively parallel sequencing, also called next-generation sequencing (NGS), has dramatically influenced cancer genomics by accelerating the identification of novel molecular alterations. Using a whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach, we identified somatic coding and noncoding variants that may contribute to leukemogenesis in 11 adult Korean acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, with serial tumor samples (primary and relapse) available for 5 of them; somatic variants were identified in 187 AML-related genes, including both novel (SIN3A, C10orf53, PTPRR, and RERGL) and well-known (NPM1, RUNX1, and CEPBA) AML-related genes. Notably, SIN3A expression shows prognostic value in AML. A newly designed method, referred to as “hot-zone” analysis, detected two putative functional noncoding variants that can alter transcription factor binding affinity near PPP1R10 and SRSF1. Moreover, the functional importance of the SRSF1 noncoding variant was further investigated by luciferase assays, which showed that the variant is critical for the regulation of gene expression leading to leukemogenesis. We expect that further functional investigation of these coding and noncoding variants will contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of AML and the development of targeted anti-cancer drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about the organizational and functional connectivity of the corticospinal (CS) circuits that are essential for voluntary movement. Here, we map the connectivity between CS neurons in the forelimb motor and sensory cortices and various spinal interneurons, demonstrating that distinct CS-interneuron circuits control specific aspects of skilled movements. CS fibers originating in the mouse motor cortex directly synapse onto premotor interneurons, including those expressing Chx10. Lesions of the motor cortex or silencing of spinal Chx10+ interneurons produces deficits in skilled reaching. In contrast, CS neurons in the sensory cortex do not synapse directly onto premotor interneurons, and they preferentially connect to Vglut3+ spinal interneurons. Lesions to the sensory cortex or inhibition of Vglut3+ interneurons cause deficits in food pellet release movements in goal-oriented tasks. These findings reveal that CS neurons in the motor and sensory cortices differentially control skilled movements through distinct CS-spinal interneuron circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreas development involves a coordinated process in which an early phase of cell segregation is followed by a longer phase of lineage restriction, expansion, and tissue remodeling. By combining clonal tracing and whole-mount reconstruction with proliferation kinetics and single-cell transcriptional profiling, we define the functional basis of pancreas morphogenesis. We show that the large-scale organization of mouse pancreas can be traced to the activity of self-renewing precursors positioned at the termini of growing ducts, which act collectively to drive serial rounds of stochastic ductal bifurcation balanced by termination. During this phase of branching morphogenesis, multipotent precursors become progressively fate-restricted, giving rise to self-renewing acinar-committed precursors that are conveyed with growing ducts, as well as ductal progenitors that expand the trailing ducts and give rise to delaminating endocrine cells. These findings define quantitatively how the functional behavior and lineage progression of precursor pools determine the large-scale patterning of pancreatic sub-compartments.

Abstract: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections are associated with a significant mortality rate, and existing drugs show poor efficacy. Identifying novel targets/pathways required for MERS infectivity is therefore important for developing novel therapeutics. As an enveloped virus, translocation through the endolysosomal system provides one pathway for cellular entry of MERS-CoV. In this context, Ca2+-permeable channels within the endolysosomal system regulate both the luminal environment and trafficking events, meriting investigation of their role in regulating processing and trafficking of MERS-CoV. Knockdown of endogenous two-pore channels (TPCs), targets for the Ca2+ mobilizing second messenger NAADP, impaired infectivity in a MERS-CoV spike pseudovirus particle translocation assay. This effect was selective as knockdown of the lysosomal cation channel mucolipin-1 (TRPML1) was without effect. Pharmacological inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release using several bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids also blocked MERS pseudovirus translocation. Knockdown of TPC1 (biased endosomally) or TPC2 (biased lysosomally) decreased the activity of furin, a protease which facilitates MERS fusion with cellular membranes. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of TPC1 activity also inhibited endosomal motility impairing pseudovirus progression through the endolysosomal system. Overall, these data support a selective, spatially autonomous role for TPCs within acidic organelles to support MERS-CoV translocation.

Abstract: Summary
Striatal locally projecting neurons, or interneurons, act on nearby circuits and shape functional output to the rest of the basal ganglia. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of striatal cells enriching for interneurons. We find seven discrete interneuron types, six of which are GABAergic. In addition to providing specific markers for the populations previously described, including those expressing Sst/Npy, Th, Npy without Sst, and Chat, we identify two small populations of cells expressing Cck with or without Vip. Surprisingly, the Pvalb-expressing cells do not constitute a discrete cluster but rather are part of a larger group of cells expressing Pthlh with a spatial gradient of Pvalb expression. Using PatchSeq, we show that Pthlh cells exhibit a continuum of electrophysiological properties correlated with expression of Pvalb. Furthermore, we find significant molecular differences that correlate with differences in electrophysiological properties between Pvalb-expressing cells of the striatum and those of the cortex.

Abstract: Summary
ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a reversible posttranslational modification involved in a range of cellular processes. Here, we report system-wide identification of serine ADPr in human cells upon oxidative stress. High-resolution mass spectrometry and unrestricted data processing confirm that serine residues are the major target of ADPr in HeLa cells. Proteome-wide analysis identifies 3,090 serine ADPr sites, with 97% of acceptor sites modulating more than 2-fold upon oxidative stress, while treatment with the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib abrogates this induction. Serine ADPr predominantly targets nuclear proteins, while structural-predictive analyses reveal that serine ADPr preferentially targets disordered protein regions. The identified ADP-ribosylated serines significantly overlap with known phosphorylated serines, and large-scale phosphoproteomics analysis provides evidence for site-specific crosstalk between serine ADPr and phosphorylation. Collectively, we demonstrate that serine ADPr is a widespread modification and a major nuclear signaling response to oxidative stress, with a regulatory scope comparable to other extensive posttranslational modifications.

Abstract: Summary
Dendrite morphogenesis is a highly regulated process that gives rise to stereotyped receptive fields, which are required for proper neuronal connectivity and function. Specific classes of neurons, including Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons, also feature complete space-filling growth of dendrites. In this system, we have identified the substrate-derived TGF-β ligand maverick (mav) as a developmental signal promoting space-filling growth through the neuronal Ret receptor. Both are necessary for radial spreading of C4da neuron dendrites, and Ret is required for neuronal uptake of Mav. Moreover, local changes in Mav levels result in directed dendritic growth toward regions with higher ligand availability. Our results suggest that Mav acts as a substrate-derived secreted signal promoting dendrite growth within not-yet-covered areas of the receptive field to ensure space-filling dendritic growth.

Abstract: Summary
Serrate (SE) is a key component in RNA metabolism. Little is known about whether and how it can regulate epigenetic silencing. Here, we report histone methyltransferases ATXR5 and ATXR6 (ATXR5/6) as novel partners of SE. ATXR5/6 deposit histone 3 lysine 27 monomethylation (H3K27me1) to promote heterochromatin formation, repress transposable elements (TEs), and control genome stability in Arabidopsis. SE binds to ATXR5/6-regulated TE loci and promotes H3K27me1 accumulation in these regions. Furthermore, SE directly enhances ATXR5 enzymatic activity in vitro. Unexpectedly, se mutation suppresses the TE reactivation and DNA re-replication phenotypes in the atxr5 atxr6 mutant. The suppression of TE expression results from triggering RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6)-dependent RNA silencing in the se atxr5 atxr6 mutant. We propose that SE facilitates ATXR5/6-mediated deposition of the H3K27me1 mark while inhibiting RDR6-mediated RNA silencing to protect TE transcripts. Hence, SE coordinates epigenetic silencing and RNA processing machineries to fine-tune the TE expression.

Abstract: Summary
The small RNA payload of mammalian sperm undergoes dramatic remodeling during development, as several waves of microRNAs and tRNA fragments are shipped to sperm during post-testicular maturation in the epididymis. Here, we take advantage of this developmental process to probe the function of the sperm RNA payload in preimplantation development. We generated zygotes via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using sperm obtained from the proximal (caput) versus distal (cauda) epididymis and then characterized the development of the resulting embryos. Embryos generated using caput sperm significantly overexpress multiple regulatory factors throughout preimplantation development, subsequently implant inefficiently, and fail soon after implantation. Remarkably, microinjection of purified cauda-specific small RNAs into caput-derived embryos not only completely rescued preimplantation molecular defects but also suppressed the post-implantation embryonic lethality phenotype. These findings reveal an essential role for small RNA remodeling during post-testicular maturation of mammalian sperm and identify a specific preimplantation gene expression program responsive to sperm-delivered microRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrantly slow translation elicits quality control pathways initiated by the ubiquitin ligase ZNF598. How ZNF598 discriminates physiologic from pathologic translation complexes and ubiquitinates stalled ribosomes selectively is unclear. Here, we find that the minimal unit engaged by ZNF598 is the collided di-ribosome, a molecular species that arises when a trailing ribosome encounters a slower leading ribosome. The collided di-ribosome structure reveals an extensive 40S-40S interface in which the ubiquitination targets of ZNF598 reside. The paucity of 60S interactions allows for different ribosome rotation states, explaining why ZNF598 recognition is indifferent to how the leading ribosome has stalled. The use of ribosome collisions as a proxy for stalling allows the degree of tolerable slowdown to be tuned by the initiation rate on that mRNA; hence, the threshold for triggering quality control is substrate specific. These findings illustrate how higher-order ribosome architecture can be exploited by cellular factors to monitor translation status.

Abstract: Summary
Sex has a role in the incidence and outcome of neurological illnesses, also influencing the response to treatments. Neuroinflammation is involved in the onset and progression of several neurological diseases, and the fact that estrogens have anti-inflammatory activity suggests that these hormones may be a determinant in the sex-dependent manifestation of brain pathologies. We describe significant differences in the transcriptome of adult male and female microglia, possibly originating from perinatal exposure to sex steroids. Microglia isolated from adult brains maintain the sex-specific features when put in culture or transplanted in the brain of the opposite sex. Female microglia are neuroprotective because they restrict the damage caused by acute focal cerebral ischemia. This study therefore provides insight into a distinct perspective on the mechanisms underscoring a sexual bias in the susceptibility to brain diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Destruction of cancer cells by therapeutic antibodies occurs, at least in part, through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and this can be mediated by various Fc-receptor-expressing immune cells, including neutrophils. However, the mechanism(s) by which neutrophils kill antibody-opsonized cancer cells has not been established. Here, we demonstrate that neutrophils can exert a mode of destruction of cancer cells, which involves antibody-mediated trogocytosis by neutrophils. Intimately associated with this is an active mechanical disruption of the cancer cell plasma membrane, leading to a lytic (i.e., necrotic) type of cancer cell death. Furthermore, this mode of destruction of antibody-opsonized cancer cells by neutrophils is potentiated by CD47-SIRPα checkpoint blockade. Collectively, these findings show that neutrophil ADCC toward cancer cells occurs by a mechanism of cytotoxicity called trogoptosis, which can be further improved by targeting CD47-SIRPα interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza virus RNA polymerase (FluPol), a heterotrimer composed of PB1, PB2, and PA subunits (P3 in influenza C), performs both transcription and replication of the viral RNA genome. For transcription, FluPol interacts with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which enables FluPol to snatch capped RNA primers from nascent host RNAs. Here, we describe the co-crystal structure of influenza C virus polymerase (FluPolC) bound to a Ser5-phosphorylated CTD (pS5-CTD) peptide. The position of the CTD-binding site at the interface of PB1, P3, and the flexible PB2 C-terminal domains suggests that CTD binding stabilizes the transcription-competent conformation of FluPol. In agreement, both cap snatching and capped primer-dependent transcription initiation by FluPolC are enhanced in the presence of pS5-CTD. Mutations of amino acids in the CTD-binding site reduce viral mRNA synthesis. We propose a model for the activation of the influenza virus transcriptase through its association with pS5-CTD of Pol II.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of macrophages by inflammatory stimuli induces reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism to support the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. Hallmarks of this metabolic rewiring are downregulation of α-ketoglutarate formation by isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and accumulation of glutamine-derived succinate, which enhances the inflammatory response via the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). Here, we identify the nuclear receptor Nur77 (Nr4a1) as a key upstream transcriptional regulator of this pro-inflammatory metabolic switch in macrophages. Nur77-deficient macrophages fail to downregulate IDH expression and accumulate higher levels of succinate and other TCA cycle-derived metabolites in response to inflammatory stimulation in a glutamine-independent manner. Consequently, these macrophages produce more nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines in an SDH-dependent manner. In vivo, bone marrow Nur77 deficiency exacerbates atherosclerosis development and leads to increased circulating succinate levels. In summary, Nur77 induces an anti-inflammatory metabolic state in macrophages that protects against chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating natural killer (NK) cells help protect the host from lympho-hematogenous acute viral diseases by rapidly entering draining lymph nodes (dLNs) to curb virus dissemination. Here, we identify a highly choreographed mechanism underlying this process. Using footpad infection with ectromelia virus, a pathogenic DNA virus of mice, we show that TLR9/MyD88 sensing induces NKG2D ligands in virus-infected, skin-derived migratory dendritic cells (mDCs) to induce production of IFN-γ by classical NK cells and other types of group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) already in dLNs, via NKG2D. Uninfected inflammatory monocytes, also recruited to dLNs by mDCs in a TLR9/MyD88-dependent manner, respond to IFN-γ by secreting CXCL9 for optimal CXCR3-dependent recruitment of circulating NK cells. This work unveils a TLR9/MyD88-dependent mechanism whereby in dLNs, three cell types—mDCs, group 1 ILCs (mostly NK cells), and inflammatory monocytes—coordinate the recruitment of protective circulating NK cells to dLNs.

Abstract: Summary
Protein aggregates and cytoplasmic vacuolization are major hallmarks of multisystem proteinopathies (MSPs) that lead to muscle weakness. Here, we identify METTL21C as a skeletal muscle-specific lysine methyltransferase. Insertion of a β-galactosidase cassette into the Mettl21c mouse locus revealed that METTL21C is specifically expressed in MYH7-positive skeletal muscle fibers. Ablation of the Mettl21c gene reduced endurance capacity and led to age-dependent accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in skeletal muscle. Denervation-induced muscle atrophy highlighted further impairments of autophagy-related proteins, including LC3, p62, and cathepsins, in Mettl21c−/− muscles. In addition, we demonstrate that METTL21C interacts with the ATPase p97 (VCP), which is mutated in various human MSP conditions. We reveal that METTL21C trimethylates p97 on the Lys315 residue and found that loss of this modification reduced p97 hexamer formation and ATPase activity in vivo. We conclude that the methyltransferase METTL21C is an important modulator of protein degradation in skeletal muscle under both normal and enhanced protein breakdown conditions.

Abstract: Rice is a facultative short-day (SD) plant in which flowering is induced under SD conditions or by other environmental factors and internal genetic programs. Overexpression of Histone Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) accelerates flowering in hybrid rice. In this study, mutants defective in HDT701 flowered late under both SD and long-day conditions. Expression levels of florigens Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and Rice Flowering Locus T1 (RFT1), and their immediate upstream floral activator Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), were significantly decreased in the hdt701 mutants, indicating that HDT701 functions upstream of Ehd1 in controlling flowering time. Transcript levels of OsINDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1 (OsIDS1), an upstream repressor of Ehd1, were significantly increased in the mutants while those of OsGI and Hd1 were reduced. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that HDT701 directly binds to the promoter region of OsIDS1. These results suggest that HDT701 induces flowering by suppressing OsIDS1.

Abstract: Summary
Most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal through both heterotrimeric G proteins and β-arrestins (βarr1 and βarr2). Although synthetic ligands can elicit biased signaling by G protein- vis-à-vis βarr-mediated transduction, endogenous mechanisms for biasing signaling remain elusive. Here we report that S-nitrosylation of a novel site within βarr1/2 provides a general mechanism to bias ligand-induced signaling through GPCRs by selectively inhibiting βarr-mediated transduction. Concomitantly, S-nitrosylation endows cytosolic βarrs with receptor-independent function. Enhanced βarr S-nitrosylation characterizes inflammation and aging as well as human and murine heart failure. In genetically engineered mice lacking βarr2-Cys253 S-nitrosylation, heart failure is exacerbated in association with greatly compromised β-adrenergic chronotropy and inotropy, reflecting βarr-biased transduction and β-adrenergic receptor downregulation. Thus, S-nitrosylation regulates βarr function and, thereby, biases transduction through GPCRs, demonstrating a novel role for nitric oxide in cellular signaling with potentially broad implications for patho/physiological GPCR function, including a previously unrecognized role in heart failure.

Abstract: Summary
Spt6 is a histone chaperone that associates with RNA polymerase II and deposits nucleosomes in the wake of transcription. Although Spt6 has an essential function in nucleosome deposition, it is not known whether this function is influenced by post-translational modification. Here, we report that casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation of Spt6 is required for nucleosome occupancy at the 5′ ends of genes to prevent aberrant antisense transcription and enforce transcriptional directionality. Mechanistically, we show that CKII phosphorylation of Spt6 promotes the interaction of Spt6 with Spn1, a binding partner required for chromatin reassembly and full recruitment of Spt6 to genes. Our study defines a function for CKII phosphorylation in transcription and highlights the importance of post-translational modification in histone chaperone function.

Abstract: Summary
Lineage analysis of autoreactive B cells can reveal the origins of autoimmunity. In the autoimmune disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV), desmoglein 3 (DSG3) and DSG1 autoantibodies are predominantly of the IgG4 subclass and less frequently of IgG1 and IgA subclasses, prompting us to investigate whether anti-DSG IgG4 B cells share lineages with IgG1, IgA1, and IgA2. Combining subclass-specific B cell deep sequencing with high-throughput antibody screening, we identified 80 DSG-reactive lineages from 4 PV patients. Most anti-DSG IgG4 B cells lacked clonal relationships to other subclasses and preferentially targeted DSG adhesion domains, whereas anti-DSG IgA frequently evolved from or to other subclasses and recognized a broader range of epitopes. Our findings suggest that anti-DSG IgG4 B cells predominantly evolve independently or diverge early from other subclasses and that IgA is most often not the origin of IgG autoreactivity in PV. These data provide insight into how autoreactivity diversifies across B cell subclasses.

Abstract: Summary
Thermogenic fat expends energy during cold for temperature homeostasis, and its activity regulates nutrient metabolism and insulin sensitivity. We measured cold-activated lipid landscapes in circulation and in adipose tissue by MS/MSALL shotgun lipidomics. We created an interactive online viewer to visualize the changes of specific lipid species in response to cold. In adipose tissue, among the approximately 1,600 lipid species profiled, we identified the biosynthetic pathway of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin as coordinately activated in brown and beige fat by cold in wild-type and transgenic mice with enhanced browning of white fat. Together, these data provide a comprehensive lipid bio-signature of thermogenic fat activation in circulation and tissue and suggest pathways regulated by cold exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington’s disease is caused by an abnormally long polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. This leads to the generation and deposition of N-terminal exon1 fragments of the protein in intracellular aggregates. We combined electron tomography and quantitative fluorescence microscopy to analyze the structural and material properties of huntingtin exon1 assemblies in mammalian cells, in yeast, and in vitro. We found that huntingtin exon1 proteins can form reversible liquid-like assemblies, a process driven by huntingtin’s polyQ tract and proline-rich region. In cells and in vitro, the liquid-like assemblies converted to solid-like assemblies with a fibrillar structure. Intracellular phase transitions of polyglutamine proteins could play a role in initiating irreversible pathological aggregation.

Abstract: Summary
Light is the most influential environmental stimulus for plant growth. In response to deficient light, plants reprogram their development to adjust their growth in search for a light source. A fine reprogramming of gene expression orchestrates this adaptive trait. Here we show that plants alter microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis in response to light transition. When plants suffer an unusual extended period of light deprivation, the miRNA biogenesis factor HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1) is degraded but an inactive pool of phosphorylated protein remains stable inside the nucleus. Degradation of HYL1 leads to the release of gene silencing, triggering a proper response to dark and shade. Upon light restoration, a quick dephosphorylation of HYL1 leads to the reactivation of miRNA biogenesis and a switch toward a developmental program that maximizes the light uptake. Our findings define a unique and fast regulatory mechanism controlling the plant silencing machinery during plant light response.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue fibrosis is associated with inflammation and insulin resistance in human obesity. In particular, visceral fat fibrosis is correlated with hyperlipidemia and ectopic fat accumulation. Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTFA) is an important coactivator that mediates the transcription of extracellular matrix and other fibrogenic genes. Here, we examine the role of MRTFA in the development of adipose tissue fibrosis and identify a signaling pathway that regulates the fate of vascular progenitors. We demonstrate that obesity induces the formation of Sca1−, Sma+, ITGA5+ fibrogenic progenitor cells (FPCs) in adipose tissue. MRTFA deficiency in mice shifts the fate of perivascular progenitors from FPCs to adipocyte precursor cells and protects against chronic obesity-induced fibrosis and accompanying metabolic dysfunction, without a shift in energy expenditure. Our findings highlight the ITGA5-MRTFA pathway as a potential target to ameliorate obesity-associated metabolic disease.

Abstract: Summary
The ventral pallidum (VP) is part of the basal ganglia circuitry and a target of both direct and indirect pathway projections from the nucleus accumbens. VP is important in cocaine reinforcement, and the firing of VP neurons is modulated in vivo during cocaine self-administration. This modulation of firing is thought to be indirect via cocaine actions on dopamine in the accumbens. Here, we show that cocaine directly inhibits synaptic transmission evoked by selective stimulation of indirect pathway projections to VP neurons. The inhibition is independent of dopamine receptor activation, absent in 5-HT1B knockout mice, and mimicked by a serotonin transporter (SERT) blocker. SERT-expressing neurons in dorsal raphe project to the VP. Optogenetic stimulation of these projections evokes serotonin transients and effectively inhibits GABAergic transmission to VP neurons. This study shows that cocaine increases endogenous serotonin in the VP to suppress synaptic transmission selectively from indirect pathway projections to VP neurons.

Abstract: Summary
The circadian clock coordinates behavioral and circadian cues with availability and utilization of nutrients. Proteasomal degradation of clock repressors, such as cryptochrome (CRY)1, maintains periodicity. Whether macroautophagy, a quality control pathway, degrades circadian proteins remains unknown. Here we show that circadian proteins BMAL1, CLOCK, REV-ERBα, and CRY1 are lysosomal targets, and that macroautophagy affects the circadian clock by selectively degrading CRY1. Autophagic degradation of CRY1, an inhibitor of gluconeogenesis, occurs in a diurnal window when rodents rely on gluconeogenesis, suggesting that CRY1 degradation is time-imprinted to maintenance of blood glucose. High-fat feeding accelerates autophagic CRY1 degradation and contributes to obesity-associated hyperglycemia. CRY1 contains several light chain 3 (LC3)-interacting region (LIR) motifs, which facilitate the interaction of cargo proteins with the autophagosome marker LC3. Using mutational analyses, we identified two distinct LIRs on CRY1 that exert circadian glycemic control by regulating CRY1 degradation, revealing LIRs as potential targets for controlling hyperglycemia.

Abstract: Oxymatrine (OMT) often used in treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus infection in clinic. However, OMT–induced liver injury has been reported. In this study, we aim to investigate the possible mechanism of OMT-induced hepatotoxicity in human normal liver cells (L02). Exposed cells to OMT, the cell viability was decreased and apoptosis rate increased, the intracellular markers of oxidative stress were changed. Simultaneously, OMT altered apoptotic related proteins levels, including Bcl-2, Bax and pro-caspase-8/-9/-3. In addition, OMT enhanced the protein levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress makers (GRP78/Bip, CHOP, and cleaved-Caspase-4) and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), as well as the mRNA levels of GRP78/Bip, CHOP, caspase-4, and ER stress sensors (IREI, ATF6, and PERK). Pre-treatment with Z-VAD-fmk, JNK inhibitor SP600125 and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, partly improved the survival rates and restored OMT-induced cellular damage, and reduced caspase-3 cleavage. SP600125 or NAC reduced OMT-induced p-JNK and NAC significantly lowered caspase-4. Furthermore, 4-PBA, the ER stress inhibitor, weakened inhibitory effect of OMT on cells, on the contrary, TM worsen. 4-PBA also reduced the levels of p-JNK and cleaved-caspase-3 proteins. Therefore, OMT-induced injury in L02 cells was related to ROS mediated p-JNK and ER stress induction. Antioxidant, by inhibition of p-JNK or ER stress, may be a feasible method to alleviate OMT-induced liver injury.

Abstract: Summary
BRCA1-deficient tumor cells have defects in homologous-recombination repair and replication fork stability, resulting in PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that a deubiquitinase, USP1, is upregulated in tumors with mutations in BRCA1. Knockdown or inhibition of USP1 resulted in replication fork destabilization and decreased viability of BRCA1-deficient cells, revealing a synthetic lethal relationship. USP1 binds to and is stimulated by fork DNA. A truncated form of USP1, lacking its DNA-binding region, was not stimulated by DNA and failed to localize and protect replication forks. Persistence of monoubiquitinated PCNA at the replication fork was the mechanism of cell death in the absence of USP1. Taken together, USP1 exhibits DNA-mediated activation at the replication fork, protects the fork, and promotes survival in BRCA1-deficient cells. Inhibition of USP1 may be a useful treatment for a subset of PARP-inhibitor-resistant BRCA1-deficient tumors with acquired replication fork stabilization.

Abstract: Summary
Although much is known about how chromosome segregation is coupled to cell division, how intracellular organelles partition during mitotic division is poorly understood. We report that the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of the ARFGEF GBF1 regulates organelle trafficking during cell division. We show that, in mitosis, GBF1 is phosphorylated on Ser292 and Ser297 by casein kinase-2 allowing recognition by the F-box protein βTrCP. GBF1 interaction with βTrCP recruits GBF1 to the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex, triggering its degradation. Phosphorylation and degradation of GBF1 occur along microtubules at the intercellular bridge of telophase cells and are required for Golgi membrane positioning and postmitotic Golgi reformation. Indeed, expression of a non-degradable GBF1 mutant inhibits the transport of the Golgi cluster adjacent to the midbody toward the Golgi twin positioned next to the centrosome and results in defective Golgi reassembly and cytokinesis failure. These findings define a mechanism that controls postmitotic Golgi reassembly and inheritance.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is resistant to most therapies including single-agent immunotherapy and has a dense desmoplastic stroma, and most patients present with advanced metastatic disease. We reveal that macrophages are the dominant leukocyte population both in human PDAC stroma and autochthonous models, with an important functional contribution to the squamous subtype of human PDAC. We targeted macrophages in a genetic PDAC model using AZD7507, a potent selective inhibitor of CSF1R. AZD7507 caused shrinkage of established tumors and increased mouse survival in this difficult-to-treat model. Malignant cell proliferation diminished, with increased cell death and an enhanced T cell immune response. Loss of macrophages rewired other features of the TME, with global changes in gene expression akin to switching PDAC subtypes. These changes were markedly different to those elicited when neutrophils were targeted via CXCR2. These results suggest targeting the myeloid cell axis may be particularly efficacious in PDAC, especially with CSF1R inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Dysfunction of microglia, the brain’s immune cells, is linked to neurodegeneration. Homozygous missense mutations in TREM2 cause Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD), an early-onset dementia. To study the consequences of these TREM2 variants, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia-like cells (iPSC-MGLCs) from patients with NHD caused by homozygous T66M or W50C missense mutations. iPSC-MGLCs expressed microglial markers and secreted higher levels of TREM2 than primary macrophages. TREM2 expression and secretion were reduced in variant lines. LPS-mediated cytokine secretion was comparable between control and TREM2 variant iPSC-MGLCs, whereas survival was markedly reduced in cells harboring missense mutations when compared with controls. Furthermore, TREM2 missense mutations caused a marked impairment in the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies, but not in Escherichia coli or zymosan substrates. Coupled with changes in apoptotic cell-induced cytokine release and migration, these data identify specific deficits in the ability of iPSC-MGLCs harboring TREM2 missense mutations to respond to specific pathogenic signals.

Abstract: Summary
Zebrafish is a powerful model for forward genetics. Reverse genetic approaches are limited by the time required to generate stable mutant lines. We describe a system for gene knockout that consistently produces null phenotypes in G0 zebrafish. Yolk injection of sets of four CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes redundantly targeting a single gene recapitulated germline-transmitted knockout phenotypes in >90% of G0 embryos for each of 8 test genes. Early embryonic (6 hpf) and stable adult phenotypes were produced. Simultaneous multi-gene knockout was feasible but associated with toxicity in some cases. To facilitate use, we generated a lookup table of four-guide sets for 21,386 zebrafish genes and validated several. Using this resource, we targeted 50 cardiomyocyte transcriptional regulators and uncovered a role of zbtb16a in cardiac development. This system provides a platform for rapid screening of genes of interest in development, physiology, and disease models in zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin organization is disrupted genome-wide during DNA replication. On newly synthesized DNA, nucleosomes are assembled from new naive histones and old modified histones. It remains unknown whether the landscape of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) is faithfully copied during DNA replication or the epigenome is perturbed. Here we develop chromatin occupancy after replication (ChOR-seq) to determine histone PTM occupancy immediately after DNA replication and across the cell cycle. We show that H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K79me3, and H3K27me3 positional information is reproduced with high accuracy on newly synthesized DNA through histone recycling. Quantitative ChOR-seq reveals that de novo methylation to restore H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels occurs across the cell cycle with mark- and locus-specific kinetics. Collectively, this demonstrates that accurate parental histone recycling preserves positional information and allows PTM transmission to daughter cells while modification of new histones gives rise to complex epigenome fluctuations across the cell cycle that could underlie cell-to-cell heterogeneity.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about the metabolism of quiescent endothelial cells (QECs). Nonetheless, when dysfunctional, QECs contribute to multiple diseases. Previously, we demonstrated that proliferating endothelial cells (PECs) use fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) for de novo dNTP synthesis. We report now that QECs are not hypometabolic, but upregulate FAO >3-fold higher than PECs, not to support biomass or energy production but to sustain the tricarboxylic acid cycle for redox homeostasis through NADPH regeneration. Hence, endothelial loss of FAO-controlling CPT1A in CPT1AΔEC mice promotes EC dysfunction (leukocyte infiltration, barrier disruption) by increasing endothelial oxidative stress, rendering CPT1AΔEC mice more susceptible to LPS and inflammatory bowel disease. Mechanistically, Notch1 orchestrates the use of FAO for redox balance in QECs. Supplementation of acetate (metabolized to acetyl-coenzyme A) restores endothelial quiescence and counters oxidative stress-mediated EC dysfunction in CPT1AΔEC mice, offering therapeutic opportunities. Thus, QECs use FAO for vasculoprotection against oxidative stress-prone exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Class 2 CRISPR-Cas nucleases are programmable genome editing tools with promising applications in human health and disease. However, DNA cleavage at off-target sites that resemble the target sequence is a pervasive problem that remains poorly understood mechanistically. Here, we use quantitative kinetics to dissect the reaction steps of DNA targeting by Acidaminococcus sp Cas12a (also known as Cpf1). We show that Cas12a binds DNA tightly in two kinetically separable steps. Protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) recognition is followed by rate-limiting R-loop propagation, leading to inevitable DNA cleavage of both strands. Despite functionally irreversible binding, Cas12a discriminates strongly against mismatches along most of the DNA target sequence. This result implies substantial reversibility during R-loop formation—a late transition state—and defies common descriptions of a “seed” region. Our results provide a quantitative basis for the DNA cleavage patterns measured in vivo and observations of greater reported target specificity for Cas12a than for the Cas9 nuclease.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming of metabolic pathways determines cell functions and fate. In our work, we have used organelle-targeted ATP biosensors to evaluate cellular metabolic settings with high resolution in real time. Our data indicate that mitochondria dynamically supply ATP for glucose phosphorylation in a variety of cancer cell types. This hexokinase-dependent process seems to be reversed upon the removal of glucose or other hexose sugars. Our data further verify that mitochondria in cancer cells have increased ATP consumption. Similar subcellular ATP fluxes occurred in young mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). However, pancreatic beta cells, senescent MEFs, and MEFs lacking mitofusin 2 displayed completely different mitochondrial ATP dynamics, indicative of increased oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings add perspective to the variability of the cellular bioenergetics and demonstrate that live cell imaging of mitochondrial ATP dynamics is a powerful tool to evaluate metabolic flexibility and heterogeneity at a single-cell level.
