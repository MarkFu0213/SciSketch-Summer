Abstract: Prostaglandin E receptor subtype 4 (EP4) knockout mice develops spontaneous hypercholesterolemia but the detailed mechanisms by which EP4 affects cholesterol homeostasis remains unexplored. We sought to determine the cause of hypercholesterolemia in EP4 knockout mice, focusing on the role of EP4 in regulating the synthesis and elimination of cholesterol. Deficiency of EP4 significantly decreased total bile acid levels in the liver by 26.2% and the fecal bile acid content by 27.6% as compared to wild type littermates, indicating that the absence of EP4 decreased hepatic bile acid synthesis and their subsequent excretion in stools. EP4 deficiency negatively regulate bile acid synthesis through repression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK)-mediated cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression and that the hypercholesterolemia in EP4 knockout mice is due to a defect in cholesterol conversion into bile acids. Deficiency of EP4 also increased de novo cholesterol synthesis and altered cholesterol fluxes in and out of the liver. Treating high fat diet-challenged mice with the pharmacological EP4 agonist, CAY10580 (200 μg/kg body weight/day i.p) for three weeks effectively prevented diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, enhanced endogenous bile acid synthesis and their fecal excretion. In summary, EP4 plays a critical role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis by regulating the synthesis and elimination of bile acids. Activation of EP4 serves as an effective novel strategy to promote cholesterol disposal in the forms of bile acids in order to lower plasma cholesterol levels.

Phosphatidylglycerophosphate phosphatase is required for root growth in Arabidopsis,

Abstract: Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is an indispensable lipid class in photosynthetic activity. However, the importance of PG biosynthesis in non-photosynthetic organs remains elusive. We previously identified phosphatidylglycerophosphate phosphatase 1 (PGPP1), which catalyzes the last step of PG biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the present report, we noted considerably shorter roots of the pgpp1-1 mutant compared to the wild type. We observed defective order of columella cells in the root apices, which was complemented by introducing the wild-type PGPP1 gene. Although PGPP1 is chloroplast-localized in leaf mesophyll cells, we observed mitochondrial localization of PGPP1 in root cells, suggesting possible dual targeting of PGPP1. Moreover, we identified previously uncharacterized 2 protein tyrosine phosphatase-like proteins as functional PGPPs. These proteins, designated PTPMT1 and PTPMT2, complemented growth and lipid phenotypes of Δgep4, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant of PGPP. The ptpmt1-1 ptpmt2-1 exhibited no visible phenotype; however, the pgpp1-1 ptpmt1-1 ptpmt2-1 significantly enhanced the root phenotype of pgpp1-1 without further affecting the photosynthesis, suggesting that these newly found PGPPs are involved in the root phenotype. Radiolabeling experiment of mutant roots showed that decreased PG biosynthesis is associated with the mutation of PGPP1. These results suggest that PG biosynthesis is required for the root growth.

Abstract: A key factor limiting the study of the origin and metabolism of brain fatty acids is the lack of cost-efficient methods available to trace fatty acids. Here, through the application of compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA), a novel, cost-efficient method, we successfully differentiated between brain DHA originating directly from dietary omega (n)−3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and brain DHA biochemically synthesized to determine the origin of brain DHA in fat-1 mice. Fat-1 mice and their wild-type littermates were either weaned onto n−6 PUFA rich, n−3 PUFA deficient diets or diets rich in both n−3 and n−6 PUFA. Isotopic analysis of fatty acid methyl esters from brain and liver tissue was conducted via gas chromatography- isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Our data demonstrates that in the presence of n−3 and n−6 PUFA, fat-1 mice obtain their brain DHA solely from n−3 PUFA sources. This study reflects the first application of CSIA to a complex multivariate model to determine the origin of brain fatty acids.

Abstract: Extracellular lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and the G-protein-coupled LPA receptors (LPAR) are involved in cell migration and invasion and found in the human endometrium. However, underlying mechanisms resulting in cellular invasion have been rarely investigated. We used stromal endometrial T-HESC, epithelial endometriotic 12Z, 49Z and Ishikawa cells. Interestingly, proliferation of T-HESC cells was strongly increased after LPA treatment, whereas the epithelial cell lines only showed a moderate increase. LPA increased invasion of 12Z and 49Z strongly and significantly. The LPAR inhibitor Ki16425 (LPAR1/3) attenuated significantly LPA-induced invasiveness of 12Z, which was confirmed by LPAR1 and LPAR3 siRNAs, showing that both LPA receptors contribute to invasiveness of 12Z cells. Investigation of cell invasion with an antibody-based protease array revealed mainly differences in cathepsins and especially cathepsin B between 12Z compared to the less invasive Ishikawa. Stimulation with LPA showed a time- and dose-dependent increased secretion of cathepsin B which was inhibited by the Gq inhibitor YM-254890 and Gi/o inhibitor pertussis toxin in the 12Z cells, again highlighting the importance of LPAR1/3. The activity of intracellular and secreted cathepsin B was significantly upregulated in LPA-treated samples. Inhibition of cathepsin B with the specific inhibitor CA074 significantly reduced LPA-increased invasion of 12Z. Our results reveal a novel role of LPA-mediated secretion of cathepsin B which stimulated invasion of endometriotic epithelial cells mainly via LPAR1 and LPAR3. These findings may deepen our understanding how endometriotic cells invade into ectopic sites, and provide new insights into the role of LPA and cathepsin B in cellular invasion.

Abstract: Objective
Intramyocellular lipid droplets (LD) and their coat proteins PLIN2 and PLIN5 are involved in lipolysis, with a putative role for PLIN5 in mitochondrial tethering. Reportedly, these proteins co-localize and cover the surface of the LD. To provide the spatial basis for understanding how these proteins possess their distinct roles, we examined the precise location of PLIN2 and PLIN5 and explored PLIN5 presence at LD-mitochondria contact sites using Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM) in human skeletal muscle sections.
Methods
LDs were stained by MDH together with combinations of mitochondrial proteins and PLINs. Subcellular distribution and co-localization of PLIN proteins and mitochondria was imaged by STED microscopy (Leica TCS SP8) and quantified using Pearson's correlation coefficients and intensity profile plots. CLEM was employed to examine the presence of PLIN5 on mitochondria-LD contact sites.
Results
Both PLIN2 and PLIN5 localized to the LD in a dot-like, juxtaposed fashion rather than colocalizing and covering the entire LD. Both STED and CLEM revealed a high fraction of PLIN5 at the LD-mitochondria interface, but not at mitochondrial cristae, as suggested previously.
Conclusion
Using two super-resolution imaging approaches, this is the first study to show that in sections of human skeletal muscle PLIN2 and PLIN5 localize to the LD at distinct sites, with abundance of PLIN5 at LD-mitochondria tethering sites. This novel spatial information uncovers that PLIN proteins do not serve as lipolytic barriers but rather are docking sites for proteins facilitating selective lipase access under a variety of lipolytic conditions.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LDs) are the main fat storing sites in almost all species from bacteria to humans. The perilipin family has been found as LD proteins in mammals, Drosophila, and a couple of slime molds, but no bacterial LD proteins containing sequence conservation were identified. In this study, we reported that the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) family was found on LDs across all organisms by LD proteomic analysis. Imaging experiments confirmed LD targeting of three representative HSD proteins including ro01416 in RHA1, DHS-3 in C. elegans, and 17β-HSD11 in human cells. In C. elegans, 17β-HSD11 family proteins (DHS-3, DHS-4 and DHS-19) were localized on LDs in distinct tissues. In intestinal cells of C. elegans, DHS-3 targeted to cytoplasmic LDs, while DHS-9 labeled nuclear LDs. Furthermore, the N-terminal hydrophobic domains of 17β-HSD11 family were necessary for their targeting to LDs. Last, 17β-HSD11 family proteins induced LD aggregation, and deletion of DHS-3 in C. elegans caused lipid decrease. Independent of their presumptive catalytic sites, 17β-HSD11 family proteins regulated LD dynamics and lipid metabolism through affecting the LD-associated ATGL, which was conserved between C. elegans and humans. Together, these findings for HSDs provide a new insight not only into the mechanistic studies of the dynamics and functions of LDs in multiple organisms, but also into understanding the evolutionary history of the organelle.

Abstract: Adipose tissue dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The adapter protein alpha-syntrophin (SNTA) is expressed in adipocytes. Knock-down of SNTA increases preadipocyte proliferation and formation of small lipid droplets, which are both characteristics of healthy adipose tissue. To elucidate a potential protective role of SNTA in NASH, SNTA null mice were fed a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet or an atherogenic diet which are widely used as preclinical NASH models. MCD diet mediated loss of fat mass was largely improved in SNTA−/− mice compared to the respective wild type animals. Hepatic lipids were mostly unchanged while the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde was only induced in the wild type mice. The expression of inflammatory markers and macrophage immigration into the liver were reduced in SNTA−/− animals. This protective function of SNTA loss was absent in atherogenic diet induced NASH. Here, hepatic expression of inflammatory and fibrotic genes was similar in both genotypes though mutant mice gained less body fat during feeding. Hepatic cholesterol and ceramide were strongly induced in both strains upon feeding the atherogenic diet, while hepatic sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine levels were suppressed. SNTA deficient mice are protected from fat loss and NASH in the experimental MCD model. NASH induced by an atherogenic diet is not influenced by loss of SNTA. The present study suggests the use of different experimental NASH models to study the pathophysiological role of proteins like SNTA in NASH.

Abstract: Background
Linoleic acid (LA) is abundant in modern industrialized diets. Oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs) and reactive aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), are present in heated vegetable oils and can be endogenously synthesized following consumption of dietary LA. OXLAMs have been implicated in cerebellar degeneration in chicks; 4-HNE is linked to neurodegenerative conditions in mammals. It unknown whether increasing dietary LA or OXLAMs alters the levels of oxidized fatty acids (oxylipins), precursor fatty acids, or 4-HNE in mammalian brain.
Objectives
To determine the effects of increases in dietary OXLAMs and dietary LA, on levels of fatty acids, oxylipins, and 4-HNE in mouse brain tissues.
Methods
Mice (n = 8 per group) were fed one of three controlled diets for 8 weeks: (1) a low LA diet, (2) a high LA diet, or (3) the low LA diet with added OXLAMs. Brain fatty acids, oxylipins, and 4-HNE were quantified in mouse cerebellum and cerebral cortex by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and immunoblot, respectively.
Results
Increasing dietary LA significantly increased omega-6 fatty acids, decreased omega-3 fatty acids, and increased OXLAMs in brain. Dietary OXLAMs had minimal effect on oxidized lipids but did decrease both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. Neither dietary LA nor OXLAMs altered 4-HNE levels.
Conclusion
Brain fatty acids are modulated by both dietary LA and OXLAMs, while brain OXLAMs are regulated by endogenous synthesis from LA, rather than incorporation of preformed OXLAMs.

Abstract: The hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle is tightly linked to the host cell lipid metabolism with the endoplasmic reticulum–derived membranous web harboring viral RNA replication complexes and lipid droplets as virion assembly sites. To investigate HCV-induced changes in the lipid composition, we performed quantitative shotgun lipidomic studies of whole cell extracts and subcellular compartments. Our results indicate that HCV infection reduces the ratio of neutral to membrane lipids. While the amount of neutral lipids and lipid droplet morphology were unchanged, membrane lipids, especially cholesterol and phospholipids, accumulated in the microsomal fraction in HCV-infected cells. In addition, HCV-infected cells had a higher relative abundance of phosphatidylcholines and triglycerides with longer fatty acyl chains and a strikingly increased utilization of C18 fatty acids, most prominently oleic acid (FA [18:1]). Accordingly, depletion of fatty acid elongases and desaturases impaired HCV replication. Moreover, the analysis of free fatty acids revealed increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) caused by HCV infection. Interestingly, inhibition of the PUFA synthesis pathway via knockdown of the rate-limiting Δ6-desaturase enzyme or by treatment with a high dose of a small-molecule inhibitor impaired viral progeny production, indicating that elevated PUFAs are needed for virion morphogenesis. In contrast, pretreatment with low inhibitor concentrations promoted HCV translation and/or early RNA replication. Taken together our results demonstrate the complex remodeling of the host cell lipid metabolism induced by HCV to enhance both virus replication and progeny production.

Abstract: Cardiac myocyte membranes contain lipids which remodel dramatically in response to heart growth and remodeling. Lipid species have both structural and functional roles. Physiological and pathological cardiac remodeling have very distinct phenotypes, and the identification of molecular differences represent avenues for therapeutic interventions. Whether the abundance of specific lipid classes is different in physiological and pathological models was largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether distinct lipids are regulated in settings of physiological and pathological remodeling, and if so, whether modulation of differentially regulated lipids could modulate heart size and function. Lipidomic profiling was performed on cardiac-specific transgenic mice with 1) physiological cardiac hypertrophy due to increased Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) receptor or Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K) signaling, 2) small hearts due to depressed PI3K signaling (dnPI3K), and 3) failing hearts due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In hearts of dnPI3K and DCM mice, several phospholipids (plasmalogens) were decreased and sphingolipids increased compared to mice with physiological hypertrophy. To assess whether restoration of plasmalogens could restore heart size or cardiac function, dnPI3K and DCM mice were administered batyl alcohol (BA; precursor to plasmalogen biosynthesis) in the diet for 16weeks. BA supplementation increased a major plasmalogen species (p18:0) in the heart but had no effect on heart size or function. This may be due to the concurrent reduction in other plasmalogen species (p16:0 and p18:1) with BA. Here we show that lipid species are differentially regulated in settings of physiological and pathological remodeling. Restoration of lipid species in the failing heart warrants further examination.

Abstract: Levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) influence plasma membrane structure and function. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized de novo in the Kennedy pathway and then undergoes extensive deacylation/reacylation remodeling via Lands' cycle (non-Kennedy pathway). The reacylation is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT), which adds a polyunsaturated fatty acid at the sn-2 position. Four LPCAT isoforms have been described to date, among which we found LPCAT3 to be the major isoform in adipose tissue, but its exact role in adipogenesis is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether LPCAT3 activity affects 3T3L1 cell adipogenic differentiation potential and its underline mechanism. Lentivirus-mediated LPCAT3 shRNA expression stably knocked down LPCAT3 in 3T3L1 preadipocytes and LPCAT3 deficiency dramatically reduced the levels of cellular polyunsaturated PCs. Importantly, we found that this deficiency activated the β-catenin dependent Wnt signaling pathway, which suppressed the expression of adipogenesis-related genes, thereby inhibiting 3T3L1 preadipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation. Moreover, three different Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors reversed the effect of LPCAP3 deficiency, suggesting that Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation is one of the causes for the observed phenotypes. To the best of our knowledge, we show here for the first time that PC remodeling is an important regulator of adipocyte differentiation.

Abstract: Erythropoietin (EPO), besides its stimulatory effect on erythropoiesis, is beneficial to insulin resistance and obesity. However, its role in hepatic steatosis remains unexplored. Activating autophagy seems a promising mechanism for improving fatty liver disease. The present study investigated the role of EPO in alleviating hepatic steatosis and sought to determine whether its function is mediated by the activation of autophagy. Here, we show that EPO decreased hepatic lipid content significantly in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, EPO/EPO receptor (EPOR) signalling induced autophagy activation in hepatocytes as indicated by western blot assay, transmission electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy. In addition, EPO increased the co-localization of autophagosomes and cellular lipids as shown by double labelling of the autophagy marker light chain microtubule-associated protein 3 (LC3) and lipids. Importantly, suppression of autophagy by an inhibitor or small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the EPO-mediated alleviation hepatic steatosis in vitro. Furthermore, EPO up-regulated sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression, and siRNA-mediated SIRT1 silencing abrogated the EPO-induced increases in LC3 protein and deacetylation levels, thereby preventing the alleviation of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, this study revealed a new mechanism wherein EPO alleviates hepatic steatosis by activating autophagy via SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of LC3. This finding might have therapeutic value in the treatment of hepatic steatosis.

Abstract: Human colon lipid analysis by imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) demonstrates that the lipid fingerprint is highly sensitive to a cell's pathophysiological state. Along the colon crypt axis, and concomitant to the differentiation process, certain lipid species tightly linked to signaling (phosphatidylinositols and arachidonic acid (AA)-containing diacylglycerophospholipids), change following a rather simple mathematical expression. We extend here our observations to ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsEtn), a unique type of glycerophospholipid presenting a vinyl ether linkage at sn-1 position. PlsEtn distribution was studied in healthy, adenomatous, and carcinomatous colon mucosa sections by IMS. In epithelium, 75% of PlsEtn changed in a highly regular manner along the crypt axis, in clear contrast with diacyl species (67% of which remained constant). Consistently, AA-containing PlsEtn species were more abundant at the base, where stem cells reside, and decreased while ascending the crypt. In turn, mono−/diunsaturated species experienced the opposite change. These gradients were accompanied by a gradual expression of ether lipid synthesis enzymes. In lamina propria, 90% of stromal PlsEtn remained unchanged despite the high content of AA and the gradient in AA-containing diacylglycerophospholipids. Finally, both lipid and protein gradients were severely affected in polyps and carcinoma. These results link PlsEtn species regulation to cell differentiation for the first time and confirm that diacyl and ether species are differently regulated. Furthermore, they reaffirm the observations on cell lipid fingerprint image sensitivity to predict cell pathophysiological status, reinforcing the translational impact both lipidome and IMS might have in clinical research.

Abstract: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) is a cytosolic enzyme catalyzing the rate limiting step in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. There is mounting evidence showing that ACC1 is susceptible to dysregulation and that it is over-expressed in liver diseases associated with lipid accumulation and in several cancers. In the present study, ACC1 regulation at the translational level is reported. Using several experimental approaches, the presence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) has been established in the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of the ACC1 mRNA. Transfection experiments with the ACC1 5′ UTR inserted in a dicistronic reporter vector show a remarkable increase in the downstream cistron translation, through a cap-independent mechanism. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress condition and the related unfolded protein response (UPR), triggered by treatment with thapsigargin and tunicamycin, cause an increase of the cap-independent translation of ACC1 mRNA in HepG2 cells, despite the overall reduction in global protein synthesis. Other stress conditions, such as serum starvation and incubation with hypoxia mimetic agent CoCl2, up-regulate ACC1 expression in HepG2 cells at the translational level. Overall, these findings indicate that the presence of an IRES in the ACC1 5′ UTR allows ACC1 mRNA translation in conditions that are inhibitory to cap-dependent translation. A potential involvement of the cap-independent translation of ACC1 in several pathologies, such as obesity and cancer, has been discussed.

Abstract: Talaromyces thermophilus lipase (TTL) was found to hydrolyze monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyl diacylglycerol (DGDG) substrates presented in various forms to the enzyme. Different assay techniques were used for each substrate: pHstat with dioctanoyl galactolipid-bile salt mixed micelles, barostat with dilauroyl galactolipid monomolecular films spread at the air-water interface, and UV absorption using a novel MGDG substrate containing α-eleostearic acid as chromophore and coated on microtiter plates. The kinetic properties of TTL were compared to those of the homologous lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL), guinea pig pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 and Fusarium solani cutinase. TTL was found to be the most active galactolipase, with a higher activity on micelles than on monomolecular films or surface-coated MGDG. Nevertheless, the UV absorption assay with coated MGDG was highly sensitive and allowed measuring significant activities with about 10 ng of enzymes, against 100 ng to 10 μg with the pHstat. TTL showed longer lag times than TLL for reaching steady state kinetics of hydrolysis with monomolecular films or surface-coated MGDG. These findings and 3D-modelling of TTL based on the known structure of TLL pointed out to two phenylalanine to leucine substitutions in TTL, that could be responsible for its slower adsorption at lipid-water interface. TTL was found to be more active on MGDG than on DGDG using both galactolipid-bile salt mixed micelles and galactolipid monomolecular films. These later experiments suggest that the second galactose on galactolipid polar head impairs the enzyme adsorption on its aggregated substrate.

Abstract: There is a growing body of evidence that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 (PARP2), although originally described as a DNA repair protein, has a widespread role as a metabolic regulator. We show that the ablation of PARP2 induced characteristic changes in the lipidome. The silencing of PARP2 induced the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and -2 and initiated de novo cholesterol biosynthesis in skeletal muscle. Increased muscular cholesterol was shunted to muscular biosynthesis of dihydrotestosterone, an anabolic steroid. Thus, skeletal muscle fibers in PARP2−/− mice were stronger compared to those of their wild-type littermates. In addition, we detected changes in the dynamics of the cell membrane, suggesting that lipidome changes also affect the biophysical characteristics of the cell membrane. In in silico and wet chemistry studies, we identified lipid species that can decrease the expression of PARP2 and potentially phenocopy the genetic abruption of PARP2, including artificial steroids. In view of these observations, we propose a new role for PARP2 as a lipid-modulated regulator of lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Cardiolipin (CL) is a unique lipid component of mitochondria in all eukaryotes. It is important for the architecture of mitochondrial membranes and for mitochondrial dynamics. CL also creates a highly specific microenvironment of mitochondrial protein machineries. CL biosynthetic pathway is, however, only partially characterized in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here we show that CL synthase is an essential protein in S. pombe. It is encoded by the ORF SPAC22A12.08c as a C terminal part of a tandem fusion protein together with a mitochondrial hydrolase of unknown function. Expression of S. pombe CL synthase is able to complement deletion of the CRD1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and, vice versa, S. cerevisiae CRD1 gene complements deletion of S. pombe SPAC22A12.08c. The proper expression of CL synthase and its partner in the tandem protein, the mitochondrial hydrolase, is regulated at the level of alternate intron splicing. The first part of the SPAC22A12.08c fusion protein could be translated from both major SPAC22A12.08c derived mRNAs, with and without intron IV. Functional CL synthase, however, is produced only from the minor SPAC22A12.08c derived mRNA that has intron IV retained. Thus, intron retention is a novel mechanism for the differential expression of two proteins that evolved as a fusion protein and are under the control of the same promoter.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT) δ/acylglycerophosphate acyltransferase 4 is a mitochondrial enzyme and one of five homologues that catalyze the acyl-CoA-dependent synthesis of phosphatidic acid (PA) from lysophosphatidic acid. We studied skeletal muscle LPAATδ and found highest levels in soleus, a red oxidative fibre-type that is rich in mitochondria, and lower levels in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (white glycolytic) and gastrocnemius (mixed fibre-type). Using Lpaatδ-deficient mice, we found no change in soleus or EDL mass, or in treadmill time-to-exhaustion compared to wildtype littermates. There was, however, a significant reduction in the proportion of type I and type IIA fibres in EDL but, surprisingly, not soleus, where these fibre-types predominate. Also unexpectedly, there was no impairment in force generation by EDL, but a significant reduction by soleus. Oxidative phosphorylation and activity of complexes I, I + II, III, and IV in soleus mitochondria was unchanged and therefore could not explain this effect. However, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was significantly reduced in Lpaatδ−/− soleus and EDL. Analysis of cellular lipids indicated no difference in soleus triacylglycerol, but specific elevations in soleus PA and phosphatidylethanolamine levels, likely due to a compensatory upregulation of Lpaatβ and Lpaatε in Lpaatδ−/− mice. An anabolic effect for PA as an activator of skeletal muscle mTOR has been reported, but we found no change in serine 2448 phosphorylation, indicating reduced soleus force generation is unlikely due to the loss of mTOR activation by a specific pool of LPAATδ-derived PA. Our results identify an important role for LPAATδ in soleus and EDL.

Abstract: The fungal linoleate diol synthase (LDS) family contains over twenty characterized 8-, 9-, and 10-dioxygenases (DOX), usually fused to catalytically competent cytochromes P450. Crystal structures are not available, but indirect evidence suggests that linoleic acid enters the active site of 8R-DOX-LDS headfirst and enters 9S-DOX-allene oxide synthase (AOS) with the ω-end (tail) first. Fatty acids derivatized with amino acids can conceivably be used to study oxidation in tail first position by enzymes, which bind natural fatty acids headfirst. The results might reveal catalytic similarities of homologous enzymes. 8R-DOX-5,8-LDS oxidize 18:2n-6-Ile and 18:2n-6-Gly in tail first position to 9S-hydroperoxy metabolites, albeit with less position and stereo specificity than 9S-DOX-AOS. The oxygenation mechanism of 9S-DOX-AOS with antarafacial hydrogen abstraction at C-11 and oxygen insertion at C-9 was also retained. Two homologues, 8R-DOX-7,8-LDS and 8R-DOX-AOS, oxidized 18:2n-6-Ile and 18:2n-6-Gly at C-9, suggesting a conserved feature of 8R-DOX domains. 9R-DOX-AOS, with 54% sequence identity to 9S-DOX-AOS, did not oxidize the derivatized C18 fatty acids. 9Z,12Z-16:2, two carbon shorter than 18:n-6 from the ω-end, was rapidly metabolized to an α-ketol, but 7Z,10Z-16:2 was not a substrate. An unsaturated carbon chain from C-1 to C-8 was apparently more important than the configuration at the ω-end. 8R-DOX-LDS and 9R-DOX-AOS may thus bind 18:2n-6 in the same orientation. The oxidation of 18:2n-6 in straight or reverse head-to-tail positions illustrates evolutionary traits between 8- and 9-DOX domains. Fatty acids derivatized with amino acids provide a complementary tool for the analysis of evolution of enzymes.

Abstract: Macrophages in adipose tissue contribute to inflammation and the development of insulin resistance in obesity. Exposure of macrophages to saturated fatty acids alters cell metabolism and activates pro-inflammatory signaling. How fatty acids influence macrophage mitochondrial dynamics is unclear. We investigated the mechanism of palmitate-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and its impact on inflammatory responses in primary human macrophages. Fatty acids, such as palmitate, caused mitochondrial fragmentation in human macrophages. Increased mitochondrial fragmentation was also observed in peritoneal macrophages from hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Fatty acid-induced mitochondrial fragmentation was independent of the fatty acid chain saturation and required dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). Mechanistically, mitochondrial fragmentation was regulated by incorporation of palmitate into mitochondrial phospholipids and their precursors. Palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential did not contribute to mitochondrial fragmentation. Macrophages treated with palmitate maintained intact mitochondrial respiration and ATP levels. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of DRP1 enhanced palmitate-induced mitochondrial ROS production, c-Jun phosphorylation, and inflammatory cytokine expression. Our results indicate that mitochondrial fragmentation is a protective mechanism attenuating inflammatory responses induced by palmitate in human macrophages.

Abstract: The physiological roles of phytosterols in chronic inflammation, which are believed to be involved in the underlying mechanisms for metabolic diseases, have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate the physiological roles of phytosterols in both clinical studies and animal experiments. We observed the existence of rather specific negative correlations between the serum sitosterol level and the serum IL-6 and the TNF-α levels in both diabetic subjects (n=46) and non-diabetic subjects (n=178). Multiple regression analyses also revealed that the serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels exhibited strong negative correlations with the serum sitosterol levels. When ABCG5/8 KO mice with markedly elevated plasma sitosterol levels and ABCG5/8 hetero mice were fed a high-fat diet, we observed that the increase in body weight, the fatty liver changes, and the expansion of perigonadal adipose tissues were suppressed in ABCG5/8 KO mice without any modulation of food intake. We also observed that the plasma IL-6 and TNF-α levels, the expressions of TNF-α and PAI-1 in the liver and the expressions of the IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 levels in the adipose tissue were lower in ABCG5/8 KO mice. These results suggest that sitosterol might suppress obesity-related chronic inflammation and might be applicable to the treatment of metabolic diseases.

Long-chain glucosylceramides crosstalk with LYN mediates endometrial cell migration,

Abstract: Endometriosis is a disease characterized by regurgitated lesions which are invasive and migratory, embedding at ectopic, extra-uterine locations. Extracellular glucosylceramides (GlcCers), bioactive sphingolipids potentiating signals for cell migration, are found in elevated levels in endometriosis; however underlying mechanisms that result in cellular migration are poorly defined. Here, we demonstrated that internalized GlcCer induced migratory activity in immortalized human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs), with highest potency observed in long-chain GlcCer. Long-chain ceramide (Cer) similarly induced cellular migration and mass spectrometry results revealed that the migratory behavior was contributed through glycosylation of ceramides. Cells treated with GlcCer synthase inhibitor, or RNAi-mediated knockdown of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), the enzyme catalyzing GlcCer production attenuated cell motility. Mechanistic studies showed that GlcCer acts through stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha and its receptor, CXC chemokine receptor 4 (SDF-1α-CXCR4) signaling axis and is dependent on phosphorylation of LYN kinase at Tyr396, and dephosphorylation of Tyr507. Migration was prominently attenuated in cells exposed to CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, yet can be rescued with diprotin A, which prevents the degradation of SDF-1α. Furthermore, blocking of LYN kinase activity in the presence of SDF-1α and GlcCer reduced HESC migration, suggesting that LYN acts downstream of GlcCer-SDF-1α-CXCR4 axis as part of its intracellular signal transduction. Our results reveal a novel role of long-chain GlcCer and the dialog between GlcCer, LYNpTyr396 and SDF-1α-CXCR4 in inducing HESC migration. This finding may improve our understanding how endometriotic lesions invade to their ectopic sites, and the possibility of using GlcCer to modulate the SDF-1α-CXCR4-LYNpTyr396 axis in endometriosis.

Abstract: The long-chain metabolites of vitamin E (LCM) emerge as a new class of regulatory metabolites and have been considered as the active compounds formed during vitamin E metabolism. The bioactivity of the LCM is comparable to the already established role of other fat-soluble vitamins. The biological modes of action of the LCM are far from being unraveled, but first insights pointed to distinct effects and suggested a specific receptor, which in turn lead to the aforementioned hypothesis. Here, a new facet on the interaction of LCM with foam cell formation of THP-1 macrophages is presented. We found reduced levels of mRNA and protein expression of lipid droplet associated protein PLIN2 by α-tocopherol (α-TOH), whereas the LCM and the saturated fatty acid, stearic acid, increased expression levels of PLIN2. In a lipotoxic setup (0–800 μM stearic acid and 0–100 μM α-TOH or 0–5 μM α-13′-COOH) differences in cellular viability were found. A reduced viability was observed for cells under co-treatment of α-TOH and stearic acid, whereas an increased viability for stearic acid incubation in combination with α-13′-COOH was observed. The striking similarity of PLIN2 expression levels and worsened or mitigated lipotoxicity, respectively, revealed a protective effect of PLIN2 on basal stearic acid-induced lipotoxic conditions in PLIN2 knockdown experiments. Based on our results, we conclude that α-13′-COOH protects cells from lipotoxicity, at least partially via PLIN2 regulation. Herewith another facet of LCM functionality was presented and their reputation as regulatory metabolites was further established.

Abstract: With dwindling available agricultural land, concurrent with increased demand for oil, there is much current interest in raising oil crop productivity. We have been addressing this issue by studying the regulation of oil accumulation in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L). As part of this research we have carried out a detailed lipidomic analysis of developing seeds. The molecular species distribution in individual lipid classes revealed quite distinct patterns and showed where metabolic connections were important. As the seeds developed, the molecular species distributions changed, especially in the period of early (20days after flowering, DAF) to mid phase (27DAF) of oil accumulation. The patterns of molecular species of diacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and acyl-CoAs were used to predict the possible relative contributions of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) and phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase to triacylglycerol production. Our calculations suggest that DGAT may hold a more important role in influencing the molecular composition of TAG. Enzyme selectivity had an important influence on the final molecular species patterns. Our data contribute significantly to our understanding of lipid accumulation in the world's third most important oil crop.

Abstract: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a crucial regulator of energy expenditure. Emerging evidence suggests that n-3 PUFA potentiate brown adipogenesis in vitro. Since the pregnancy and lactation is a critical time for brown fat formation, we hypothesized that maternal supplementation of n-3 PUFA promotes BAT development in offspring. Female C57BL/6 mice were fed a diet containing n-3 PUFA (3%) derived from fish oil (FO), or an isocaloric diet devoid of n-3 PUFA (Cont) during pregnancy and lactation. Maternal n-3 PUFA intake was delivered to the BAT of neonates significantly reducing the n-6/n-3 ratio. The maternal n-3 PUFA exposure was linked with upregulated brown-specific gene and protein profiles and the functional cluster of brown-specific miRNAs. In addition, maternal n-3 PUFA induced histone modifications in the BAT evidenced by 1) increased epigenetic signature of brown adipogenesis, i.e., H3K27Ac and H3K9me2, 2) modified chromatin-remodeling enzymes, and 3) enriched the H3K27Ac in the promoter region of Ucp1. The offspring received maternal n-3 PUFA nutrition exhibited a significant increase in whole-body energy expenditure and better maintenance of core body temperature against acute cold treatment. Collectively, our results suggest that maternal n-3 PUFA supplementation potentiates fetal BAT development via the synergistic action of miRNA production and histone modifications, which may confer long-lasting metabolic benefits to offspring.

Abstract: Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) supports survival of normal cells under low oxygen concentration and cancer cells in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. This involves metabolic reprogramming via upregulation of glycolysis, downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and, less well documented, effects on lipid metabolism. To investigate the latter, we examined expression of relevant enzymes in cancer cells grown under hypoxia. We show that expression of acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 2 (AGPAT2), also known as lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase β (LPAATβ), was upregulated under hypoxia and this was impaired by siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-1α. Moreover, a sequence of the AGPAT2 gene promoter region, containing 6 putative Hypoxia Response Elements (HREs), activated transcription of a reporter gene under hypoxic conditions or in normoxic cells over-expressing HIF-1α. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed binding of HIF-1α to one of these HREs, mutation of which abolished hypoxic activation of the AGPAT2 promoter. Knockdown of AGPAT2 by siRNA reduced lipid droplet accumulation and cell viability under hypoxia and increased cancer cell sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic etoposide. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that AGPAT2, which is mutated in patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy and over-expressed in different types of cancer, is a direct transcriptional target of HIF-1, suggesting that upregulation of lipid storage by HIF-1 plays an important role in adaptation and survival of cancer cells under low oxygen conditions.

Abstract: The CYP74C subfamily of fatty acid hydroperoxide transforming enzymes includes hydroperoxide lyases (HPLs) and allene oxide synthases (AOSs). This work reports a new facet of the putative CYP74C HPLs. Initially, we found that the recombinant CYP74C13_MT (Medicago truncatula) behaved predominantly as the epoxyalcohol synthase (EAS) towards the 9(S)-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid. At the same time, the CYP74C13_MT mostly possessed the HPL activity towards the 13(S)-hydroperoxides of linoleic and α-linolenic acids. To verify whether this dualistic behaviour of CYP74C13_MT is occasional or typical, we also examined five similar putative HPLs (CYP74C). These were CYP74C4_ST (Solanum tuberosum), CYP74C2 (Cucumis melo), CYP74C1_CS and CYP74C31 (both of Cucumis sativus), and CYP74C13_GM (Glycine max). All tested enzymes behaved predominantly as EAS toward 9-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid. Oxiranyl carbinols such as (9S,10S,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acids were the major EAS products. Besides, the CYP74C31 possessed an additional minor 9-AOS activity. The mutant forms of CYP74C13_MT, CYP74C1_CS, and CYP74C31 with substitutions at the catalytically essential domains, namely the “hydroperoxide-binding domain” (I-helix), or the SRS-1 domain near the N-terminus, showed strong AOS activity. These HPLs to AOSs conversions were observed for the first time. Until now a large part of CYP74C enzymes has been considered as 9/13-HPLs. Notwithstanding, these results show that all studied putative CYP74C HPLs are in fact the versatile HPL/EASs that can be effortlessly mutated into specific AOSs.

Abstract: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the most common model for multiple sclerosis, is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration into the central nervous system and demyelination. Previous studies have demonstrated that administration of some polyphenols may reduce the neurological alterations of EAE. In this work, we show that ellagic acid, a polyphenolic compound, is beneficial in EAE, most likely through stimulation of ceramide biosynthesis within the brain. EAE was induced in Lewis rats by injection of guinea-pig spinal cord tissue along with Freund's complete adjuvant containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Clinical signs first appeared at day 8 post-immunization and reached a peak within 3 days, coincident with reduction of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the cortex. Sphingolipids, the other major components of myelin, also decreased at the acute phase of EAE, both in the cerebral cortex and in the spinal cord. In rats receiving ellagic acid in the drinking water from 2 days before immunization, the onset of the disease was delayed and clinical signs were reduced. This amelioration of clinical signs was accompanied by sustained levels of both MBP and sphingolipid in the cortex, without apparent changes in infiltration of inflammatory CD3+ T-cells, microglial activation, or weight loss, which together suggest a neuroprotective effect of ellagic acid. Finally, in glioma and oligodendroglioma cells we demonstrate that urolithins, the ellagic acid metabolites that circulate in plasma, stimulate the synthesis of ceramide. Together these data suggest that ellagic acid consumption protects against demyelination in rats with induced EAE, likely by a mechanism involving sphingolipid synthesis.

Abstract: Exposing the adolescent brain to drugs of abuse is associated with increased risk for adult onset psychopathologies. Cannabis use peaks during adolescence, with largely unknown effects on the developing brain. Cannabis' major psychoactive component, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) alters neuronal, astrocytic, and microglial signaling. Therefore, multiple cellular and signaling pathways are affected with a single dose of THC. The endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs), N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) are members of an interconnected lipidome that includes an emerging class of AEA structural analogs, the lipoamines, additional 2-acyl glycerols, free fatty acids, and prostaglandins (PGs). Lipids in this lipidome share many biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, yet have diverse signaling properties. Here, we show that acute THC drives age-dependent changes in this lipidome across 8 regions of the female mouse brain. Interestingly, most changes are observed in the adult, with eCBs and related lipids predominately decreasing. Analysis of THC and metabolites reveals an unequal distribution across these brain areas; however, the highest levels of THC were measured in the hippocampus (HIPP) in all age groups. Transcriptomic analysis of the HIPP after acute THC showed that like the lipidome, the adult transcriptome demonstrated significantly more changes than the adolescent. Importantly, the regulation of 31 genes overlapped between the adolescent and the adult, suggesting a conserved transcriptomic response in the HIPP to THC exposure independent of age. Taken together these data illustrate that the first exposure to a single dose of THC has profound effects on signaling in the CNS.

Abstract: The human retina is a complex structure of organised layers of specialised cells that support the transmission of light signals to the visual cortex. The outermost layer of the retina, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), forms part of the blood retina barrier and is implicated in many retinal diseases. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid exerting pleiotropic effects in various cell types, during development, normal physiology and disease. Its producing enzyme, AUTOTAXIN (ATX), is highly expressed by the pigmented epithelia of the human eye, including the RPE. Using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived retinal cells, we interrogated the role of LPA in the human RPE and photoreceptors. hPSC-derived RPE cells express and synthesize functional ATX, which is predominantly secreted apically of the RPE, suggesting it acts in a paracrine manner to regulate photoreceptor function. In RPE cells, LPA regulates tight junctions, in a receptor-dependent mechanism, with an increase in OCCLUDIN and ZONULA OCCLUDENS (ZO)-1 expression at the cell membrane, accompanied by an increase in the transepithelial resistance of the epithelium. High concentration of LPA decreases phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by the RPE. In hPSC-derived photoreceptors, LPA induces morphological rearrangements by modulating the actin myosin cytoskeleton, as evidenced by Myosin Light Chain l membrane relocation. Collectively, our data suggests an important role of LPA in the integrity and functionality of the healthy retina and blood retina barrier.

Abstract: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with excessive oxidative stress which may affect placental vascular function. Cholesterol homeostasis is crucial for maintaining fetoplacental endothelial function. We aimed to investigate whether and how GDM affects cholesterol metabolism in human fetoplacental endothelial cells (HPEC). HPEC were isolated from fetal term placental arterial vessels of GDM or control subjects. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by H2DCFDA fluorescent dye. Oxysterols were quantified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis. Genes and proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis were detected by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. Cholesterol efflux was determined from [3H]-cholesterol labeled HPEC and [14C]-acetate was used as cholesterol precursor to measure cholesterol biosynthesis and esterification. We detected enhanced formation of ROS and of specific, ROS-derived oxysterols in HPEC isolated from GDM versus control pregnancies. ROS-generated oxysterols were simultaneously elevated in cord blood of GDM neonates. Liver-X receptor activation in control HPEC by synthetic agonist TO901319, 7-ketocholesterol, or 7β-hydroxycholesterol upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC)A1 and ABCG1 expression, accompanied by increased cellular cholesterol efflux. Upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 and increased cholesterol release to apoA-I and HDL3 (78 ± 17%, 40 ± 9%, respectively) were also observed in GDM versus control HPEC. The LXR antagonist GGPP reversed ABCA1 and ABCG1 upregulation and reduced the increased cholesterol efflux in GDM HPEC. Similar total cellular cholesterol levels were detected in control and GDM HPEC, while GDM enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis along with upregulated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) mRNA and protein levels. Our results suggest that in GDM cellular cholesterol homeostasis in the fetoplacental endothelium is modulated via LXR activation and helps to maintain its proper functionality.

Abstract: Aims
Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) inhibitors have been proposed as potential therapeutic approaches against insulin resistance-related inflammation and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which these molecules drive these effects in skeletal muscle remain unknown. Here, we assessed whether the FABP4 inhibitor BMS309403 prevented lipid-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated inflammation in skeletal muscle.
Materials and methods
The BMS309403 treatment was assessed both in the skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and in palmitate-stimulated C2C12 myotubes.
Results
HFD feeding promoted insulin resistance, which is characterized by increased plasma levels of glucose, insulin, non-esterified fatty acids, triglycerides, resistin, and leptin and reduced plasma levels of adiponectin compared with control mice fed a standard diet. Additionally, insulin-resistant animals showed increased FABP4 plasma levels. In line with this evidence, recombinant FABP4 attenuated the insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation in C2C12 myotubes. Treatment with BMS309403 reduced lipid-induced ER stress and inflammation in both mouse skeletal muscle and C2C12 myotubes. The effects of the FABP4 inhibitor reducing lipid-induced ER stress-associated inflammation were related to the reduction of fatty acid-induced intramyocellular lipid deposits, ROS and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation. Accordingly, BMS309403 reduced lipid-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which is upstream of NF-κB activation.
Conclusion
Overall, these findings indicate that BMS309403 reduces fatty acid-induced ER stress-associated inflammation in skeletal muscle by reducing p38 MAPK activation.

Abstract: Resistance against chemotherapy is a life-threatening complication in colon cancer therapy. To increase response rate, new additional targets that contribute to chemoresistance are still needed to be explored. Ceramides, which belong to the group of sphingolipids, are well-known regulators of cell death and survival, respectively. Here, we show that in human wild-type (wt) p53 HCT-116 colon cancer cells treatment with oxaliplatin or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) leads to a strong increase in ceramide synthase 5 (CerS5) expression and C16:0-ceramide levels, which was not shown in HCT-116 lacking p53 expression (HCT-116 p53−/−). The increase in CerS5 expression occurs by stabilizing CerS5 mRNA at the 3′-UTR. By contrast, in the p53-deficient cells CerS2 expression and CerS2-related C24:0- and C24:1-ceramide levels were elevated which is possibly related to enhanced polyadenylation of the CerS2 transcript in these cells. Stable knockdown of CerS5 expression using CerS5-targeting shRNA led to an increased sensitivity of HCT-116 p53wt cells, but not of p53−/− cells, to oxaliplatin and 5-FU. Enhanced sensitivity was accompanied by an inhibition of autophagy and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in these cells. However, knockdown of CerS2 had no significant effects on chemosensitivity of both cell lines. In conclusion, in p53wt colon cancer cells chemosensitivity against oxaliplatin or 5-FU could be enhanced by downregulation of CerS5 expression leading to reduced autophagy and mitochondrial respiration.

Abstract: Brown adipose tissue is specialized to generate heat by dissipating chemical energy and may provide novel strategies for obesity treatment in humans. Recently, advances in understanding the pharmacological and dietary agents that contribute to the browning of white adipose tissue have been made to alleviate obesity by promoting energy expenditure. Krill oil is widely used as a health supplement in humans. In this study, the components from krill oil that promote adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells were screened to reveal palmitoyl lactic acid (PLA) as a promoter of adipogenesis. The PLA-induced adipocytes contained large number of small lipid droplets. Moreover, similar to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ agonists, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, PLA significantly enhances adipogenesis in the presence of dexamethasone compared with PLA alone. Treatment with PLA causes a brown fat-like phenotype in 3T3-L1 cells by enhanced expression of various brown/beige cell-specific genes, such as PR domain containing 16 (Prdm16) and peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (Pgc1a), as well as adiponectin gene. The expression profile of the brown/beige cell-specific genes induced by PLA was similar to that of the PPARγ agonist in 3T3-L1 cells. Our findings suggest that PLA induces a brown fat-like phenotype and, thus, likely has therapeutic potential in treating obesity.

Abstract: Lipoxygenases (ALOXs) are involved in the regulation of cellular redox homeostasis. They also have been implicated in the biosynthesis of pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators and play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, which constitute a major health challenge owing to increasing incidence and prevalence in all industrialized countries around the world. To explore the pathophysiological role of Alox15 (leukocyte-type 12-LOX) in mouse experimental colitis we tested the impact of systemic inactivation of the Alox15 gene on the extent of dextrane sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis. We found that in wildtype mice expression of the Alox15 gene was augmented during DSS-colitis while expression of other Alox genes (Alox5, Alox15b) was hardly altered. Systemic Alox15 (leukocyte-type 12-LOX) deficiency induced less severe colitis symptoms and suppressed in vivo formation of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), the major Alox15 (leukocyte-type 12-LOX) product in mice. These alterations were paralleled by reduced expression of pro-inflammatory gene products, by sustained expression of the zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) and by a less impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function. These results are consistent with in vitro incubations of colon epithelial cells, in which addition of 12S-HETE compromised enantioselectively transepithelial electric resistance. Consistent with these data transgenic overexpression of human ALOX15 intensified the inflammatory symptoms. In summary, our results indicate that systemic Alox15 (leukocyte-type 12-LOX) deficiency protects mice from DSS-colitis. Since exogenous 12-HETE compromises the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1 the protective effect has been related to a less pronounced impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier function.

Abstract: Mammalian phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP, also known as AUM or glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase) is a small molecule-directed phosphatase important for metabolite repair and lipid metabolism. Although PGP was first characterized as an enzyme involved in epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, PGP protein substrates have remained elusive. Here we show that PGP depletion facilitates fatty acid flux through the intracellular triacylglycerol/fatty acid cycle, and that phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), produced in a side branch of this cycle, is critical for the impact of PGP activity on EGF-induced signaling. Loss of endogenous PGP expression amplified both EGF-induced EGF receptor autophosphorylation and Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1). Furthermore, EGF enhanced the formation of circular dorsal ruffles in PGP-depleted cells via Src/PLCγ1/protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent signaling to the cytoskeleton. Inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase normalized the increased PIP2 content, reduced EGF-dependent PLCγ1 hyperphosphorylation, and decreased the elevated dorsal ruffle formation of PGP-depleted cells. Our data explain how PGP exerts control over EGF-induced cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and reveal an unexpected influence of triacylglycerol turnover on growth factor signaling.

Abstract: Nucleated cells eliminate lesions induced by bacterial pore-forming toxins, such as pneumolysin via shedding patches of damaged plasmalemma into the extracellular milieu. Recently, we have shown that the majority of shed pneumolysin is present in the form of inactive pre-pores. This finding is surprising considering that shedding is triggered by Ca2+-influx following membrane perforation and therefore is expected to positively discriminate for active pores versus inactive pre-pores. Here we provide evidence for the existence of plasmalemmal domains that are able to attract pneumolysin at high local concentrations. Within such a domain an immediate plasmalemmal perforation induced by a small number of pneumolysin pores would be capable of triggering the elimination of a large number of not yet active pre-pores/monomers and thus pre-empt more frequent and perilous perforation events. Our findings provide further insights into the functioning of the cellular repair machinery which benefits from an inhomogeneous plasmalemmal distribution of pneumolysin.

Abstract: Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) is the only known enzyme, which hydrolyzes cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols in lysosomes of multiple cells and tissues. Here, we explored the role of LAL in brown adipose tissue (BAT). LAL-deficient (Lal−/−) mice exhibit markedly reduced UCP1 expression in BAT, modified BAT morphology with accumulation of lysosomes, and mitochondrial dysfunction, consequently leading to regular hypothermic events in mice kept at room temperature. Cold exposure resulted in reduced lipid uptake into BAT, thereby aggravating dyslipidemia and causing life threatening hypothermia in Lal−/− mice. Linking LAL as a potential regulator of lipoprotein lipase activity, we found Angptl4 mRNA expression upregulated in BAT. Our data demonstrate that LAL is critical for shuttling fatty acids derived from circulating lipoproteins to BAT during cold exposure. We conclude that inhibited lysosomal lipid hydrolysis in BAT leads to impaired thermogenesis in Lal−/− mice.

Abstract: The pannexin-1 (Panx1) channel has been reported to mediate the release of ATP that is involved in local tissue inflammation, obesity, and many chronic degenerative diseases. It remains unknown whether Panx1 is present in podocytes and whether this channel in podocytes mediates ATP release leading to glomerular inflammation or fibrosis. To answer these questions, we first characterized the expression of Panx channels in podocytes. Among the three known pannexins, Panx1 was the most enriched in podocytes, either cultured or native in mouse glomeruli. Using a Port-a-Patch planar patch-clamp system, we recorded a large voltage-gated outward current through podocyte membrane under the Cs+in/Na+out gradient. Substitution of gluconate or aspartate for chloride in the bath solution blocked voltage-gated outward currents and shifted the reversal potential of Panx1 currents to the right, indicating the anion permeability of this channel. Pharmacologically, the recorded voltage-gated outward currents were substantially attenuated by specific Panx1 channel inhibitors. Given the anti-inflammatory and intracellular ATP restorative effects of adiponectin, we tested whether this adipokine inhibits Panx1 channel activity to block ATP release. Adiponectin blocked Panx1 channel activity in podocytes. Mechanistically, inhibition of acid ceramidase (AC) remarkably enhanced Panx1 channel activity under control conditions and prevented the inhibition of Panx1 channel by adiponectin. Correspondingly, intracellular addition of AC products, sphingosine or sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), blocked Panx1 channel activity, while elevation of intracellular ceramide had no effect on Panx1 channel activity. These results suggest that adiponectin inhibits Panx1 channel activity in podocytes through activation of AC and associated elevation of intracellular S1P.

Abstract: Although singly ablating Fabp1 or Scp2/Scpx genes may exacerbate the impact of high fat diet (HFD) on whole body phenotype and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), concomitant upregulation of the non-ablated gene, preference for ad libitum fed HFD, and sex differences complicate interpretation. Therefore, these issues were addressed in male and female mice ablated in both genes (Fabp1/Scp2/Scpx null or TKO) and pair-fed HFD. Wild-type (WT) males gained more body weight as fat tissue mass (FTM) and exhibited higher hepatic lipid accumulation than WT females. The greater hepatic lipid accumulation in WT males was associated with higher hepatic expression of enzymes in glyceride synthesis, higher hepatic bile acids, and upregulation of transporters involved in hepatic reuptake of serum bile acids. While TKO had little effect on whole body phenotype and hepatic bile acid accumulation in either sex, TKO increased hepatic accumulation of lipids in both, specifically phospholipid and cholesteryl esters in males and females and free cholesterol in females. TKO-induced increases in glycerides were attributed not only to complete loss of FABP1, SCP2 and SCPx, but also in part to sex-dependent upregulation of hepatic lipogenic enzymes. These data with WT and TKO mice pair-fed HFD indicate that: i) Sex significantly impacted the ability of HFD to increase body weight, induce hepatic lipid accumulation and increase hepatic bile acids; and ii) TKO exacerbated the HFD ability to induce hepatic lipid accumulation, regardless of sex, but did not significantly alter whole body phenotype in either sex.

Abstract: ACSL3 is the only long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase consistently found on growing and mature lipid droplets (LDs), suggesting that this specific localization has biological relevance. Current models for LD growth propose that triglycerides are synthesized by enzymes at the LD surface, with activated fatty acids provided by LD localized ACSL3, thus allowing growth independent of the ER. Here, we tested this hypothesis by quantifying ACSL3 on LDs from human A431 cells. RNAi of ACSL3 reduced the oleoyl-CoA synthetase activity by 83%, suggesting that ACSL3 is by far the dominant enzyme of A431 cells. Molar quantification revealed that there are 1.4 million ACSL3 molecules within a single cell. Metabolic labeling indicated that each ACSL3 molecule contributed a net gain of 3.1 oleoyl-CoA/s. 3D reconstruction of confocal images demonstrated that 530 individual lipid droplets were present in an average oleate fed A431 cell. A representative single lipid droplet with a diameter of 0.66 μm contained 680 ACSL3 molecules on the surface. Subcellular fractionation showed that at least 68% of ACSL3 remain at the ER even during extensive fatty acid supplementation. High resolution single molecule microscopy confirmed the abundance of cytoplasmic ACSL3 outside of LDs. Model calculations for triglyceride synthesis using only LD localized ACSL3 gave significant slower growth of LDs as observed experimentally. In conclusion, although ACSL3 is an abundant enzyme on A431 LDs, the metabolic capacity is not sufficient to account for LD growth solely by the local synthesis of triglycerides.

Abstract: Microglia regulate immune responses in the brain, and their activation is key to the pathogenesis of diverse neurological diseases. Receptor-mediated lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling has been known to regulate microglial biology, but it is still unclear which receptor subtypes guide the biology, particularly, microglial activation. Here, we investigated the pathogenic aspects of LPA receptor subtype 1 (LPA1) in microglial activation using a systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration-induced septic mouse model in vivo and LPS-stimulated rat primary microglia in vitro. LPA1 knockdown in the brain with its specific shRNA lentivirus attenuated the sepsis-induced microglia activation, morphological transformation, and proliferation. LPA1 knockdown also resulted in the downregulation of TNF-α, at both mRNA and protein levels in septic brains, but not IL-1β or IL-6. In rat primary microglia, genetic or pharmacological blockade of LPA1 attenuated gene upregulation and secretion of TNF-α in LPS-stimulated cells. In particular, the latter was associated with the suppressed TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) activity. We reaffirmed these biological aspects using a BV2 microglial cell line in which LPA1 expression was negligible. LPA1 overexpression in BV2 cells led to significant increments in TNF-α production upon stimulation with LPS, whereas inhibiting LPA1 reversed the production. We further identified ERK1/2, but not p38 MAPK or Akt, as the underlying effector pathway after LPA1 activation in both septic brains and stimulated microglia. The current findings of the novel role of LPA1 in microglial activation along with its mechanistic aspects could be applied to understanding the pathogenesis of diverse neurological diseases that involve microglial activation.

Abstract: Lipoxygenase (LOX) is the key enzyme involved in the synthesis of oxylipins as signaling compounds that are important for cell growth and development, inflammation, and pathogenesis in various organisms. The regiospecificity of LOX from Myxococcus xanthus, a gram-negative bacterium, was investigated. The enzyme catalyzed oxygenation at the n-9 position in C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to form 12S- and 14S-hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs), respectively, and oxygenation at the n-6 position in C18 PUFAs to form 13-HFAs. The 12S-form products of C20 and C22 PUFAs by M. xanthus LOX is the first report of bacterial LOXs. The residues involved in regiospecificity were determined to be Thr397, Ala461, and Ile664 by analyzing amino acid alignment and a homology model based on human arachidonate 15-LOX with a sequence identity of 25%. Among these variants, the regiospecificity of the T397Y variant for C20 and C22 PUFAs was changed. This may be because of the reduced size of the substrate-binding pocket by substitution of the smaller Thr to the larger Tyr residue. The T397Y variant catalyzed oxygenation at the n-6 position in C20 and C22 PUFAs to form 15- and 17-hydroperoxy fatty acids, respectively. However, the oxygenation position of T397Y for C18 PUFAs was not changed. The discovery of bacterial LOX with novel regiospecificity will facilitate the biosynthesis of regiospecific‑oxygenated signaling compounds.

Abstract: Obesity often leads non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. Expression of carboxylesterase CES1 is positively correlated with increased lipid storage and plasma lipid concentration. Here we investigated structural and metabolic consequences of a single nucleotide polymorphism in CES1 gene that results in p.Gly143Glu amino acid substitution. We generated a humanized mouse model expressing CES1WT (control), CES1G143E and catalytically dead CES1S221A (negative control) in the liver in the absence of endogenous expression of the mouse orthologous gene. We show that the CES1G143E variant exhibits only 20% of the wild-type lipolytic activity. High-fat diet fed mice expressing CES1G143E had reduced liver and plasma triacylglycerol levels. The mechanism by which decreased CES1 activity exerts this hypolipidemic phenotype was determined to include decreased very-low density lipoprotein secretion, decreased expression of hepatic lipogenic genes and increased fatty acid oxidation as determined by increased plasma ketone bodies and hepatic mitochondrial electron transport chain protein abundance. We conclude that attenuation of human CES1 activity provides a beneficial effect on hepatic lipid metabolism. These studies also suggest that CES1 is a potential therapeutic target for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease management.

Abstract: Deficiency of hepatic Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) expression activates liver X receptor α (LXRα) in an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα)-dependent manner, thereby inducing severe hepatic lipid accumulation and hypertriglyceridemia. Statins have been demonstrated non-cholesterol lowering effects including anti-nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Herein, we investigated if the anti-NAFLD function of statins depends on activation of NgBR expression. In vivo, atorvastatin protected apoE deficient or NgBR floxed, but not hepatic NgBR deficient mice, against Western diet (WD)-increased triglyceride levels in liver and serum. In vitro, statins reduced lipid accumulation in nonsilencing small hairpin RNA-transfected (shNSi), but not in NgBR small hairpin RNA-transfected (shNgBRi) HepG2 cells. Inhibition of cellular lipid accumulation by atorvastatin is related to activation of AMPKα, and inactivation of LXRα and lipogenic genes. Statin also inhibited expression of oxysterol producing enzymes. Associated with changes of hepatic lipid levels by WD or atorvastatin, NgBR expression was inversely regulated. At cellular levels, statins increased NgBR mRNA and protein expression, and NgBR protein stability. In contrast to reduced cellular cholesterol levels by statin or β-cyclodextrin, increased cellular cholesterol levels decreased NgBR expression suggesting cholesterol or its synthesis intermediates inhibit NgBR expression. Indeed, mevalonate, geranylgeraniol or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate or farnesol, blocked atorvastatin-induced NgBR expression. Furthermore, we determined that induction of hepatic NgBR expression by atorvastatin mainly depended on inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (Akt). Taken together, our study demonstrates that statins inhibit NAFLD mainly through activation of NgBR expression.

Abstract: Physical contacts between organelles play a pivotal role in intracellular trafficking of metabolites. Monitoring organelle interactions in living cells using fluorescence microscopy is a powerful approach to functionally assess these cellular processes. However, detailed target acquisition is typically limited due to light diffraction. Furthermore, subcellular compartments such as lipid droplets and mitochondria are highly dynamic and show significant subcellular movement. Thus, high-speed acquisition of these organelles with extended-resolution is appreciated. Here, we present an imaging informatics pipeline enabling spatial and time-resolved analysis of the dynamics and interactions of fluorescently labeled lipid droplets and mitochondria in a fibroblast cell line. The imaging concept is based on multispectral confocal laser scanning microscopy and includes high-speed resonant scanning for fast spatial acquisition of organelles. Extended-resolution is achieved by the recording of images at minimized pinhole size and by post-processing of generated data using a computational image restoration method. Computation of inter-organelle contacts is performed on basis of segmented spatial image data. We show limitations of the image restoration and segmentation part of the imaging informatics pipeline. Since both image processing methods are implemented in other related methodologies, our findings will help to identify artifacts and the false-interpretation of obtained morphometric data. As a proof-of-principle, we studied how lipid load and overexpression of PLIN5, considered to be involved in the tethering of LDs and mitochondria, affects organelle association.

Liver-directed microRNA-7a depletion induces nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by stabilizing YY1-mediated lipogenic pathways in zebrafish,

Abstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with the function and changes in expression levels of microRNAs (miRs). MiR-7 has been proven to play an important role in many cellular processes; however, its functions in the context of liver lipogenesis remain unknown. We applied the microRNA-sponge (miR-SP) technology and generated transgenic miR-7a-SP models (hC7aSP and bC7aSP), which disrupted the activities of hepatic miR-7a and induced the early onset of NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in zebrafish. We identified a novel miR-7a target, YY1, and demonstrated novel miR-7a functions to regulate zebrafish hepatic lipid metabolism by controlling YY1 stabilization through the regulation of the expression of lipogenic signaling pathways. Correspondingly, liver specific miR-7a depletion functionally promoted lipid accumulation in hC7ASP livers. NASH hC7aSP increased the expression of inflammatory genes (il-1b, il-6, tnf-α, ifn-γ, nfkb2, and NF-kB) and endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (atf6, ern2, ire1, perk, hspa5 and ddit3). Molecular analysis revealed that miR-7a-SP can stabilize YY1 expression and contribute to the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides by reducing the CHOP-10 expression in the hC7aSP and then inducing the transactivation of C/EBP-α and PPAR-γ expression. PPAR-γ antagonists and miR-7a mimic treatment ameliorate hC7aSP NASH phenotypes. Conclusion: Our results suggest that miR-7a-SP acts as a lipid enhancer by directly increasing YY1 stability to disrupt CHOP-10-dependent suppression of lipogenic pathways, resulting in increased lipid accumulation. MiR-7a expression improves liver steatosis and steatohepatitis in hC7aSPs, which suggests a novel strategy for the prevention and early treatment of NASH in humans.

Abstract: E. coli has three Cls-isoenzymes for cardiolipin (CL) synthesis but the differences between these three enzymes remain unresolved. All three Cls enzymes contain the phospholipase D (PLD) characteristic HKD motive and synthesize CL using PLD activity. Here, using LC-MS we show the effect of overexpressing or deletion of the three individual Cls enzymes on the lipidome, which included changes in lipid class distribution and CL species profiles. We demonstrate, for the first time, that overexpression of only ClsB resulted in the appreciable synthesis of a variety of phosphatidylalcohols, thereby establishing a ‘classic’ PLD activity for this enzyme: phospholipid headgroup exchange. Endogenous E. coli lipids and primary alcohols were substrates for this trans-phosphatidylation reaction. Furthermore, we show that endogenous levels of ClsA mediated a similar trans-phosphatidylation reaction to form phosphatidylalcohols, however this reaction was dependent on the presence of the foreign phospholipid class phosphatidylcholine (PC). This allows us to clarify the different specificities of the cardiolipin synthases.

Abstract: RBP4 (plasma retinol-binding protein) is the 21 kDa transporter of all-trans retinol that circulates in plasma as a moderately tight 1:1 molar complex of the vitamin with the protein. RBP4 is primarily synthesized in the liver but is also produced by adipose tissue and circulates bound to a larger protein, transthyretin, TTR, that serves to increase its molecular mass and thus avoid its elimination by glomerular filtration. This paper reports the high resolution three-dimensional structures of human RBP4 naturally lacking bound retinol purified from plasma, urine and amniotic fluid. In all these crystals we found a fatty acid molecule bound in the hydrophobic ligand-binding site, a result confirmed by mass spectrometry measurements. In addition we also report the 1.5 Å resolution structures of human holo-RBP4 and of the protein saturated with palmitic and lauric acid and discuss the interaction of the fatty acids and retinol with the protein.

Abstract: The replacement of two consecutive histidine residues by alanine residues in the catalytic center of ceramide synthase 2 in a new transgenic mouse mutant (CerS2 H/A) leads to inactivation of catalytic activity and reduces protein level to 60% of the WT level. We show here by qRT-PCR and transcriptome analyses that several transcripts of genes involved in lipid metabolism and cell division are differentially regulated in livers of CerS2 H/A mice. Thus, very long chain ceramides produced by CerS2 are required for transcriptional regulation of target genes. The hepatocellular carcinomata previously described in old CerS2 KO mice were already present in 8-week-old CerS2 H/A animals and thus are caused by the loss of CerS2 catalytic activity already during early life.

Abstract: The distribution of lipids in tears is critical to their function. Lipids in human tears may retard evaporation by forming a surface barrier at the air interface. Lipids complexed with the major lipid binding protein in tears, tear lipocalin, reside in the bulk (aqueous) and may have functions unrelated to the surface. Many new lipids species have been revealed through recent mass spectrometric studies. Their association with lipid binding proteins has not been studied. Squalene, (O-acyl) omega-hydroxy fatty acids (OAHFA) and ceramides are examples. Even well-known lipids such as wax and cholesteryl esters are only presumed to be unbound because extracts of protein fractions of tears were devoid of these lipids. Our purpose was to determine by direct binding assays if the aforementioned lipids can bind tear lipocalin. Lipids were screened for ability to displace DAUDA from tear lipocalin in a fluorescence displacement assay. Di- and tri-glycerides, squalene, OAHFA, wax and cholesterol esters did not displace DAUDA from tear lipocalin. However, ceramides displaced DAUDA. Apparent dissociation constants for ceramide-tear lipocalin complexes using fluorescent analogs were measured consistently in the submicromolar range with 3 methods, linear spectral summation, high speed centrifugal precipitation and standard fluorescence assays. At the relatively small concentrations in tears, all ceramides were complexed to tear lipocalin. The lack of binding of di- and tri-glycerides, squalene, OAHFA, as well as wax and cholesterol esters to tear lipocalin is consonant with residence of these lipids near the air interface.

Abstract: Scope
Circadian clock plays a principal role in orchestrating our daily physiology and metabolism, and their perturbation can evoke metabolic diseases such as fatty liver and insulin resistance. Nobiletin (NOB) has been demonstrated to possess antitumor and neuroprotective activities. The objective of the current study is to determine potential effects of NOB on modulating the core clock gene Bmal1 regarding ameliorating glucolipid metabolic disorders.
Results
Our results revealed that NOB partially reverse the relatively shallow daily oscillations of circadian clock genes and reset phase-shifting circadian rhythms in primary hepatocytes under metabolic disorders conditions. Importantly, NOB was found to be effective at amplifying glucose uptake via stimulating IRS-1/AKT signaling pathway, as well as blunting palmitate-induced lipogenesis in HepG2 cells via modulating AMPK-Sirt1 signaling pathway and key enzymes of de novo lipogenesis in a Bmal1-dependent manner. NOB attenuated palmitate-stimulated excessive secretions of ROS, restored the depletions of mitochondrial membrane potential, which is similar to the recovery in expressions of mitochondrial respiration complex I-IV.
Conclusion
This study is the first to provide compelling evidences that NOB prevent cellular glucolipid metabolic imbalance and mitochondrial function in a Bmal1-dependent manner. Overall, NOB may serve as a nutritional preventive strategy in recovering metabolic disorders relevant to circadian clock.

Abstract: The gastrointestinal tract is increasingly viewed as critical in controlling glucose metabolism, because of its role in secreting multiple glucoregulatory hormones, such as glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Here we investigate the molecular pathways behind the GLP-1- and insulin-secreting capabilities of a novel GPR119 agonist, Oleoyl-lysophosphatidylinositol (Oleoyl-LPI). Oleoyl-LPI is the only LPI species able to potently stimulate the release of GLP-1 in vitro, from murine and human L-cells, and ex-vivo from murine colonic primary cell preparations. Here we show that Oleoyl-LPI mediates GLP-1 secretion through GPR119 as this activity is ablated in cells lacking GPR119 and in colonic primary cell preparation from GPR119−/− mice. Similarly, Oleoyl-LPI-mediated insulin secretion is impaired in islets isolated from GPR119−/− mice. On the other hand, GLP-1 secretion is not impaired in cells lacking GPR55 in vitro or in colonic primary cell preparation from GPR55−/− mice. We therefore conclude that GPR119 is the Oleoyl-LPI receptor, upstream of ERK1/2 and cAMP/PKA/CREB pathways, where primarily ERK1/2 is required for GLP-1 secretion, while CREB activation appears dispensable.

Abstract: Fatty liver features triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes and often occurs with obesity and lipodystrophy in humans. Here, we investigated the mechanism of maladaptive hepatosteatosis with adipose-tissue dysfunction. Perilipin 1 (Plin1) did not exist in hepatocytes but was expressed exclusively in adipocytes as a dual modulator for regulating two principal adipose-tissue functions, triglyceride storage and breakdown. Plin1−/− mice showed decreased fat storage but increased lipolysis and efflux of fatty acids from adipose tissue, and hepatosteatosis spontaneously developed without altered circulating inflammatory adipocytokine levels. Plin1−/− adipose dysfunction impaired insulin sensitivity and hepatic glucose metabolism, which might inhibit gluconeogenesis to produce more intermediates for hepatic lipid synthesis. Indeed, the livers of Plin1−/− mice exhibited upregulated mRNA and protein expression of key enzymes and transcriptional factors for the uptake and transport of fatty acids and for de novo synthesis of triglycerides, but the expression of key enzymes and transcriptional factors for fatty-acid oxidation was downregulated. Biochemical assays in Plin1−/− mice confirmed increased fatty acid synthase activity but decreased activity of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and [3H]-palmitate oxidation in the liver. We concluded that dysregulation of two principal functions, adipose storage and hydrolysis, had deleterious consequences on the hepatic lipid metabolism and thereby caused maladaptive hepatosteatosis. This mouse model might mimic and explain the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis occurring in two typical disorders of adipose tissue dysfunction, obesity and lipodystrophy, particularly in lipodystrophic patients with Plin1 mutation.

Abstract: Analysis of fatty acids from the cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. PCC 8801 revealed that this species contained high levels of myristic acid (14:0) and linoleic acid in its glycerolipids, with minor contributions from palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid, and oleic acid. The level of 14:0 relative to total fatty acids reached nearly 50%. This 14:0 fatty acid was esterified primarily to the sn-2 position of the glycerol moiety of glycerolipids. This characteristic is unique because, in most of the cyanobacterial strains, the sn-2 position is esterified exclusively with C16 fatty acids, generally 16:0. Transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with the PCC8801_1274 gene for lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase) from Cyanothece sp. PCC 8801 increased the level of 14:0 from 2% to 17% in total lipids and the increase in the 14:0 content was observed in all lipid classes. These findings suggest that the high content of 14:0 in Cyanothece sp. PCC 8801 might be a result of the high specificity of this acyltransferase toward the 14:0-acyl-carrier protein.

Abstract: The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene is tightly related to body weight and fat mass, and plays a pivotal role in regulating lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. However, the mechanisms underlying its function are poorly understood. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) is a transcription factor that regulates lipogenesis. Cell death-inducing DFFA (DNA fragmentation factor-α)-like effector c (CIDEC) plays a crucial role in lipid droplets (LDs) size controlling and lipid accumulation. In this report, we first observed that FTO overexpression in HepG2 cells resulted in an increase of lipogenesis and up-regulation of SREBP1c and CIDEC, two key regulatory factors in lipogenesis. In contrast, FTO knockdown in HepG2 cells resulted in a decrease of lipogenesis and down-regulation of SREBP1c and CIDEC expression. Moreover, SREBP1c knockdown resulted in a decrease of lipogenesis in HepG2 cells with FTO overexpression. In addition, FTO demethylation defect mutant presented less transcription of the key genes, and less nuclear translocation and maturation of SREBP1c. Further investigation demonstrated that overexpression of SREBP1c in HepG2 cells also promoted high CIDEC expression. Luciferase reporter assays showed that SREBP1c significantly stimulated CIDEC gene promoter activity. Finally, CIDEC knockdown reduced SREBP1c-induced lipogenesis. In conclusion, our studies suggest that FTO increased the lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by increasing nuclear translocation of SREBP1c and SREBP1c maturation, thus improving the transcriptional activity of LD-associated protein CIDEC. Our studies may provide new mechanistic insight into nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mediated by FTO.

Abstract: Given their important role in neuronal function, there has been an increasing focus on altered lipid levels in brain disorders. The effect of a high-fat (HF) diet on the lipid profiles of the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulb of the mouse brain was investigated using nanoflow ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry in the current study. For 8 weeks, two groups of 5-week-old mice were fed either an HF or normal diet (6 mice from each group analyzed as the F and N groups, respectively). The remaining mice in both groups then received a 4-week normal diet. Each group was then subdivided into two groups for another 4-week HF or normal diet. Quantitative analysis of 270 of the 359 lipids identified from brain tissue revealed that an HF diet significantly affected the brain lipidome in all brain regions that were analyzed. The HF diet significantly increased diacylglycerols, which play a role in insulin resistance in all regions that were analyzed. Although the HF diet increased most lipid species, the majority of phosphatidylserine species were decreased, while lysophosphatidylserine species, with the same acyl chain, were substantially increased. This result can be attributed to increased oxidative stress due to the HF diet. Further, weight-cycling (yo-yo effect) was found more critical for the perturbation of brain lipid profiles than weight gain without a preliminary experience of an HF diet. The present study reveals systematic alterations in brain lipid levels upon HF diet analyzed either by lipid class and molecular levels.

Abstract: Metabolomics and lipidomics are of fundamental importance to personalized healthcare. Particularly the analysis of bioactive lipids is of relevance to a better understanding of various diseases. Within clinical routines, blood derived samples are widely used for diagnostic and research purposes. Hence, standardized and validated procedures for blood collection and storage are mandatory, in order to guarantee sample integrity and relevant study outcomes. We here investigated different plasma storage conditions and their effect on plasma fatty acid and oxylipid levels. Our data clearly indicate the importance of storage conditions for plasma lipidomic analysis. Storage at very low temperature (−80 °C) and the addition of methanol directly after sampling are the most important measures to avoid ex vivo synthesis of oxylipids. Furthermore, we identified critical analytes being affected under certain storage conditions. Finally, we carried out chiral analysis and found possible residual enzymatic activity to be one of the contributors to the ex vivo formation of oxylipids even at −20 °C.

Abstract: We have previously shown that phospholipase D (PLD) pathways have a role in neuronal degeneration; in particular, we found that PLD activation is associated with synaptic injury induced by oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated the effect of α-synuclein (α-syn) overexpression on PLD signaling. Wild Type (WT) α-syn was found to trigger the inhibition of PLD1 expression as well as a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and expression levels. Moreover, ERK1/2 subcellular localization was shown to be modulated by WT α-syn in a PLD1-dependent manner. Indeed, PLD1 inhibition was found to alter the neurofilament network and F-actin distribution regardless of the presence of WT α-syn. In line with this, neuroblastoma cells expressing WT α-syn exhibited a degenerative-like phenotype characterized by a marked reduction in neurofilament light subunit (NFL) expression and the rearrangement of the F-actin organization, compared with either the untransfected or the empty vector-transfected cells. The gain of function of PLD1 through the overexpression of its active form had the effect of restoring NFL expression in WT α-syn neurons. Taken together, our findings reveal an unforeseen role for α-syn in PLD regulation: PLD1 downregulation may constitute an early mechanism in the initial stages of WT α-syn-triggered neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Organisms store fatty acids in triacylglycerols in the form of lipid droplets, or hydrolyze triacylglycerols in response to energetic demands via activation of lipolytic or storage pathways. These pathways are complex sets of sequential reactions that are finely regulated in different cell types. Here we present a high spatial and temporal resolution-based method for the quantification of the turnover of fatty acids into triglycerides in live cells without introducing sample preparation artifacts. We performed confocal spectral imaging of intracellular micropolarity in cultured insulin secreting beta cells to detect micropolarity variations as they occur in time and at different pixels of microscope images. Acquired data are then analyzed in the framework of the spectral phasors technique. The method furnishes a metabolic parameter, which quantitatively assesses fatty acids - triacylglycerols turnover and the activation of lipolysis and storage pathways. Moreover, it provides a polarity profile, which represents the contribution of hyperpolar, polar and non-polar classes of lipids. These three different classes can be visualized on the image at a submicrometer resolution, revealing the spatial localization of lipids in cells under physiological and pathological settings. This new method allows for a fine-tuned, real-time visualization of the turnover of fatty acids into triglycerides in live cells with submicrometric resolution. It also detects imbalances between lipid storage and usage, which may lead to metabolic disorders within living cells and organisms.

Abstract: Enteric glial cells (EGCs) are components of the enteric nervous system, an organized structure that controls gut functions. EGCs may be vulnerable to different agents, such as bacterial infections that could alter the intestinal epithelial barrier, allowing bacterial toxins and/or other agents possessing intrinsic toxic effect to access cells. Palmitate, known to exhibit lipotoxicity, is released in the gut during the digestion process. In this study, we investigated the lipotoxic effect of palmitate in cultured EGCs, with particular emphasis on palmitate-dependent intracellular lipid remodeling. Palmitate but not linoleate altered mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum lipid composition. In particular, the levels of phosphatidic acid, key precursor of phospholipid synthesis, increased, whereas those of mitochondrial cardiolipin (CL) decreased; in parallel, phospholipid remodeling was induced. CL remodeling (chains shortening and saturation) together with palmitate-triggered mitochondrial burst, caused cytochrome c (cyt c) detachment from its CL anchor and accumulation in the intermembrane space as soluble pool. Palmitate decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels, without mPTP opening. Mitochondrial ROS permeation into the cytosol and palmitate-induced ER stress activated JNK and p38, culminating in Bim and Bax overexpression, factors known to increase the outer mitochondrial membrane permeability. Overall, in EGCs palmitate produced weakening of cyt c-CL interactions and favoured the egress of the soluble cyt c pool outside mitochondria to trigger caspase-3-dependent viability loss. Elucidating the mechanisms of palmitate lipotoxicity in EGCs may be relevant in gut pathological conditions occurring in vivo such as those following an insult that may damage the intestinal epithelial barrier.

Abstract: Changes in sphingolipid metabolism have been linked to modulation of cell fate in both yeast and mammalian cells. We previously assessed the role of sphingolipids in cell death regulation using a well characterized yeast model of acetic acid-induced regulated cell death, finding that Isc1p, inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase C, plays a pro-death role in this process. Indeed, isc1∆ mutants exhibited a higher resistance to acetic acid associated with reduced mitochondrial alterations. Here, we show that Isc1p is regulated by Sch9p under acetic acid stress, since both single and double mutants lacking Isc1p or/and Sch9p have the same resistant phenotype, and SCH9 deletion leads to a higher retention of Isc1p in the endoplasmic reticulum upon acetic acid exposure. We also found that the higher resistance of all mutants correlates with higher levels of endogenous mitochondrial phosphorylated long chain bases (LCBPs), suggesting that changing the sphingolipid balance in favour of LCBPs in mitochondria results in increased survival to acetic acid. In conclusion, our results suggest that Sch9p pathways modulate acetic acid-induced cell death, through the regulation of Isc1p cellular distribution, thus affecting the sphingolipid balance that regulates cell fate.

Abstract: To achieve optimal development of a newborn, breastfeeding is extensively recommended, but little is known about the role of non-nutritive bioactive milk components. We aimed to characterize the fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), namely palmitic acid hydroxystearic acids (PAHSAs)—endogenous lipids with anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties, in human breast milk. Breast milk samples from 30 lean (BMI=19–23) and 23 obese (BMI>30) women were collected 72h postpartum. Adipose tissue and milk samples were harvested from C57BL/6J mice. FAHFA lipid profiles were measured using reverse phase and chiral liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. PAHSA regioisomers as well as other FAHFAs were present in both human and murine milk. Unexpectedly, the levels of 5-PAHSA were higher relative to other regioisomers. The separation of both regioisomers and enantiomers of PAHSAs revealed that both R- and S-enantiomers were present in the biological samples, and that the majority of the 5-PAHSA signal is of R configuration. Total PAHSA levels were positively associated with weight gain during pregnancy, and 5-PAHSA as well as total PAHSA levels were significantly lower in the milk of the obese compared to the lean mothers. Our results document for the first time the presence of lipid mediators from the FAHFA family in breast milk, while giving an insight into the stereochemistry of PAHSAs. They also indicate the negative effect of obesity on 5-PAHSA levels. Future studies will be needed to explore the role and mechanism of action of FAHFAs in breast milk.

Abstract: Monoacylglycerol lipases (MGL) are a subclass of lipases that predominantly hydrolyze monoacylglycerol (MG) into glycerol and fatty acid. MGLs are ubiquitous enzymes across species and play a role in lipid metabolism, affecting energy homeostasis and signaling processes. Structurally, MGLs belong to the α/β hydrolase fold family with a cap covering the substrate binding pocket. Analysis of the known 3D structures of human, yeast and bacterial MGLs revealed striking similarity of the cap architecture. Since MGLs from different organisms share very low sequence similarity, it is difficult to identify MGLs based on the amino acid sequence alone. Here, we investigated whether the cap architecture could be a characteristic feature of this subclass of lipases with activity towards MG and whether it is possible to identify MGLs based on the cap shape. Through database searches, we identified the structures of five different candidate α/β hydrolase fold proteins with unknown or reported esterase activity. These proteins exhibit cap architecture similarities to known human, yeast and bacterial MGL structures. Out of these candidates we confirmed MGL activity for the protein LipS, which displayed the highest structural similarity to known MGLs. Two further enzymes, Avi_0199 and VC1974, displayed low level MGL activities. These findings corroborate our hypothesis that this conserved cap architecture can be used as criterion to identify lipases with activity towards MGs.

Abstract: Unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) play crucial roles in living organisms regarding development, energy metabolism, stress resistance, etc. The biosynthesis of UFAs starts from the introduction of the first double bond by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), converting saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). This desaturation is considered to be an aerobic process that requires cytochrome b5 reductase, cytochrome b5 and SCD. However, this enzyme system remains elusive in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we show that inactivation by RNAi knockdown or mutation (gk442189) of putative cytochrome b5 genes cytb-5.1 led to reduced conversion of C18:0 to C18:1(n-9) by SCD desaturases FAT-6/7 in C. elegans. On the contrary, cytb-5.2RNAi and cytb-5.2(gk113588) mutant worms showed decreased conversion of C16:0 to C16:1(n-7) by FAT-5 desaturase. Dietary supplementation with C18:1(n-9) and C18:2(n-6) also showed that CYTB-5.1 is likely required for the activity of FAT-6/7 desaturases, but not for FAT-1 to FAT-4 desaturases. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) demonstrated that either FAT-7 or FAT-5 has ability to interact with both CYTB-5.1 and CYTB-5.2. Moreover, RNAi knockdown of cytb-5.1 upregulates the transcriptional and translational expression of fat-5 to fat-7, which may be due to the feedback induction by reduced C18:1(n-9) and downstream fatty acids. Furthermore, both CYTB-5.1 and CYTB-5.2 are involved in fat accumulation, fertility and lifespan in worms, which may be independent of changes in fatty acid compositions. Collectively, these findings for the first time reveal the differential regulation of various SCDs by distinct cytochrome b5 CYTB-5.1 and CYTB-5.2 in the biosynthesis of UFAs in C. elegans.

Genetic re-engineering of polyunsaturated phospholipid profile of Saccharomyces cerevisiae identifies a novel role for Cld1 in mitigating the effects of cardiolipin peroxidation,

Abstract: Cardiolipin (CL) is a unique phospholipid localized almost exclusively within the mitochondrial membranes where it is synthesized. Newly synthesized CL undergoes acyl remodeling to produce CL species enriched with unsaturated acyl groups. Cld1 is the only identified CL-specific phospholipase in yeast and is required to initiate the CL remodeling pathway. In higher eukaryotes, peroxidation of CL, yielding CLOX, has been implicated in the cellular signaling events that initiate apoptosis. CLOX can undergo enzymatic hydrolysis, resulting in the release of lipid mediators with signaling properties. Our previous findings suggested that CLD1 expression is upregulated in response to oxidative stress, and that one of the physiological roles of CL remodeling is to remove peroxidized CL. To exploit the powerful yeast model to study functions of CLD1 in CL peroxidation, we expressed the H. brasiliensis Δ12-desaturase gene in yeast, which then synthesized poly unsaturated fatty acids(PUFAs) that are incorporated into CL species. Using LC-MS based redox phospholipidomics, we identified and quantified the molecular species of CL and other phospholipids in cld1Δ vs. WT cells. Loss of CLD1 led to a dramatic decrease in chronological lifespan, mitochondrial membrane potential, and respiratory capacity; it also resulted in increased levels of mono-hydroperoxy-CLs, particularly among the highly unsaturated CL species, including tetralinoleoyl-CL. In addition, purified Cld1 exhibited a higher affinity for CLOX, and treatment of cells with H2O2 increased CLD1 expression in the logarithmic growth phase. These data suggest that CLD1 expression is required to mitigate oxidative stress. The findings from this study contribute to our overall understanding of CL remodeling and its role in mitigating oxidative stress.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidylinositols (LPI) are bioactive lipids that are implicated in several pathophysiological processes such as cell proliferation, migration and tumorigenesis and were shown to play a role in obesity and metabolic disorders. Often, these effects of LPI were due to activation of the G protein-coupled receptor GPR55. However, the role of LPI and GPR55 in inflammation and macrophage activation remains unclear. Therefore, we thought to study the effect of macrophage activation and inflammation on LPI levels and metabolism. To do so, we used J774 and BV2 cells in culture activated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 100 ng/mL) as well as primary mouse alveolar and peritoneal macrophages. We also quantified LPI levels in the cerebellum, lung, liver, spleen and colon of mice with a systemic inflammation induced by LPS (300 μg/kg) and in the colon of mice with acute colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) or trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and chronic DSS-induced colitis. Our data show that LPS-induced macrophage activation leads to altered LPI levels in both the cells and culture medium. We also show that cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) and α/β‑hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) are among the enzymes implicated in LPI metabolism in J774 macrophages. Indeed, ABHD6 and cPLA2α inhibition increased 20:4-LPI levels in LPS-activated macrophages. Furthermore, incubation of LPS-activated cells with LPI decreased J774 activation in a GPR55-dependent manner. In vivo, LPI levels were altered by inflammation in the liver, spleen and colon. These alterations are tissue dependent and could highlight a potential role for LPI in inflammatory processes.

Abstract: The zebrafish larva is a powerful tool for the study of dietary triglyceride (TG) digestion and how fatty acids (FA) derived from dietary lipids are absorbed, metabolized and distributed to the body. While fluorescent FA analogues have enabled visualization of FA metabolism, methods for specifically assaying TG digestion are badly needed. Here we present a novel High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method that quantitatively differentiates TG and phospholipid (PL) molecules with one or two fluorescent FA analogues. We show how this tool may be used to discriminate between undigested and digested TG or phosphatidylcholine (PC), and also the products of TG or PC that have been digested, absorbed and re-synthesized into new lipid molecules. Using this approach, we explored the dietary requirement of zebrafish larvae for phospholipids. Here we demonstrate that dietary TG is digested and absorbed in the intestinal epithelium, but without dietary PC, TG accumulates and is not transported out of the enterocytes. Consequently, intestinal ER stress increases and the ingested lipid is not available support the energy and metabolic needs of other tissues. In TG diets with PC, TG is readily transported from the intestine and subsequently metabolized.

Abstract: N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) is known to be a precursor for various bioactive N-acylethanolamines including the endocannabinoid anandamide. NAPE is produced in mammals through the transfer of an acyl chain from certain glycerophospholipids to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by Ca2+-dependent or -independent N-acyltransferases. The ε isoform of mouse cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2ε) was recently identified as a Ca2+-dependent N-acyltransferase (Ca-NAT). In the present study, we first showed that two isoforms of human cPLA2ε function as Ca-NAT. We next purified both mouse recombinant cPLA2ε and its two human orthologues to examine their catalytic properties. The enzyme absolutely required Ca2+ for its activity and the activity was enhanced by phosphatidylserine (PS). PS enhanced the activity 25-fold in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 and lowered the EC50 value of Ca2+ >8-fold. Using a PS probe, we showed that cPLA2ε largely co-localizes with PS in plasma membrane and organelles involved in the endocytic pathway, further supporting the interaction of cPLA2ε with PS in living cells. Finally, we found that the Ca2+-ionophore ionomycin increased [14C]NAPE levels >10-fold in [14C]ethanolamine-labeled cPLA2ε-expressing cells while phospholipase A/acyltransferase-1, acting as a Ca2+-independent N-acyltransferase, was insensitive to ionomycin for full activity. In conclusion, PS potently stimulated the Ca2+-dependent activity and human cPLA2ε isoforms also functioned as Ca-NAT.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most malignant, angiogenic, and incurable tumors in humans. The aberrant communication between glioblastoma cells and tumor microenvironment represents one of the major factors regulating glioblastoma malignancy and angiogenic properties. Emerging evidence implicates sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in the pathobiology of glioblastoma and angiogenesis, but its role in glioblastoma-endothelial crosstalk remains largely unknown. In this study, we sought to determine whether the crosstalk between glioblastoma cells and brain endothelial cells regulates sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Using human glioblastoma and brain endothelial cell lines, as well as primary brain endothelial cells derived from human glioblastoma, we report that glioblastoma-co-culture promotes the expression, activity, and plasma membrane enrichment of sphingosine kinase 2 in brain endothelial cells, leading to increased cellular level of sphingosine-1-phosphate, and significant potentiation of its secretion. In turn, extracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate stimulates glioblastoma cell proliferation, and brain endothelial cells migration and angiogenesis. We also show that, after co-culture, glioblastoma cells exhibit enhanced expression of S1P1 and S1P3, the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors that are of paramount importance for cell growth and invasivity. Collectively, our results envision glioblastoma-endothelial crosstalk as a multi-compartmental strategy to enforce pro-tumoral sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in the glioblastoma microenvironment.

Abstract: Maternal obesity is associated with adverse outcomes. Placental lipid droplets (LD) have been implicated in maternal-fetal lipid transfer but it is not known whether placental LD fat composition is modifiable. We evaluated the effects of a diet and physical activity intervention in obese pregnant women compared to routine antenatal care (UPBEAT study) on placental LD composition. LD were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Total FAs and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholines, PCs; sphingomyelins, SMs and lyso-phosphatidylcholines, Lyso-PCs) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Placenta MFSD2a expression was assessed by western blot. Placental LDs from obese women were comprised of predominantly saturated and monounsaturated FAs. TG and Chol composition was similar between intervention (n = 20) and control (n = 23) groups. PCs containing dihomo-ɣ-linolenic acid in LD were positively associated with gestational weight gain (P < 0.007), and lowered by the intervention. In the whole sample, PCs carrying DHA and arachidonic acid were inversely associated with placental weight. Placenta MFSD2a expression was associated with DHA cord blood metabolites and relationships were observed between LD lipids, especially DHA carrying species, and cord blood metabolites. We describe placenta LD composition for the first time and demonstrate modest, potentially beneficial effects of a lifestyle intervention on LD FAs in obese pregnant women.

Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative pathogen, which causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromized patients. These bacteria express a secreted lipoxygenase (PA-LOX), which oxygenates free arachidonic acid to 15S-hydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid. It binds phospholipids at its active site and physically interacts with lipid vesicles. When incubated with red blood cells membrane lipids are oxidized and hemolysis is induced but the structures of the oxygenated membrane lipids have not been determined. Using a lipidomic approach, we analyzed the formation of oxidized phospholipids generated during the in vitro incubation of recombinant PA-LOX with human erythrocytes and cultured human lung epithelial cells. Precursor scanning of lipid extracts prepared from these cells followed by multiple reaction monitoring and MS/MS analysis revealed a complex mixture of oxidation products. For human red blood cells this mixture comprised forty different phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine species carrying oxidized fatty acid residues, such as hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids, hydroxy- and keto-eicosatetraenoic acid, hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid as well as oxygenated derivatives of less frequently occurring polyenoic fatty acids. Similar oxygenation products were also detected when cultured lung epithelial cells were employed but here the amounts of oxygenated lipids were smaller and under identical experimental conditions we did not detect major signs of cell lysis. However, live imaging indicated an impaired capacity for trypan blue exclusion and an augmented mitosis rate. Taken together these data indicate that PA-LOX can oxidize the membrane lipids of eukaryotic cells and that the functional consequences of this reaction strongly depend on the cell type.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are stored up to 35–42days at 2–6°C in blood banks. During storage, the RBC membrane is challenged by energy depletion, decreasing pH, altered cation homeostasis, and oxidative stress, leading to several biochemical and morphological changes in RBCs and to shedding of extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the storage medium. These changes are collectively known as RBC storage lesions. EVs accumulate in stored RBC concentrates and are, thus, transfused into patients. The potency of EVs as bioactive effectors is largely acknowledged, and EVs in RBC concentrates are suspected to mediate some adverse effects of transfusion. Several studies have shown accumulation of lipid raft–associated proteins in RBC EVs during storage, whereas a comprehensive phospholipidomic study on RBCs and corresponding EVs during the clinical storage period is lacking. Our mass spectrometric and chromatographic study shows that RBCs maintain their major phospholipid (PL) content well during storage despite abundant vesiculation. The phospholipidomes were largely similar between RBCs and EVs. No accumulation of raft lipids in EVs was seen, suggesting that the primary mechanism of RBC vesiculation during storage might not be raft -based. Nonetheless, a slight tendency of EV PLs for shorter acyl chains was observed.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid growth factor which is present in high levels in serum and platelets. LPA binds to its specific G-protein-coupled receptors, including LPA1 to LPA6, thereby regulating various physiological functions, including cancer growth, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis. Our previous study showed that LPA promotes the expression of the lymphangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Interestingly, LPA has been shown to regulate the expression of calreticulin (CRT), a multifunctional chaperone protein, but the roles of CRT in PCa progression remain unclear. Here we investigated the involvement of CRT in LPA-mediated VEGF-C expression and lymphangiogenesis in PCa. Knockdown of CRT significantly reduced LPA-induced VEGF-C expression in PC-3 cells. Moreover, LPA promoted CRT expression through LPA receptors LPA1 and LPA3, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). Tumor-xenografted mouse experiments further showed that CRT knockdown suppressed tumor growth and lymphangiogenesis. Notably, clinical evidence indicated that the LPA-producing enzyme autotaxin (ATX) is related to CRT and that CRT level is highly associated with lymphatic vessel density and VEGF-C expression. Interestingly, the pharmacological antagonist of LPA receptors significantly reduced the lymphatic vessel density in tumor and lymph node metastasis in tumor-bearing nude mice. Together, our results demonstrated that CRT is critical in PCa progression through the mediation of LPA-induced VEGF-C expression, implying that targeting the LPA signaling axis is a potential therapeutic strategy for PCa.

Abstract: Phosphoinositides are present in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and inside the cell nucleus. Here we identify phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) as a regulator of rRNA genes transcription at the epigenetic level. We show that PIP2 directly interacts with histone lysine demethylase PHF8 (PHD finger protein 8) and represses demethylation of H3K9me2 through this interaction. We identify the C-terminal K/R-rich motif as PIP2-binding site within PHF8, and address the function of this PIP2-PHF8 complex. PIP2-binding mutant of PHF8 has increased the activity of rDNA promoter (20%) and expression of pre-rRNA genes (47S-100%; 45S-66%). Furthermore, trypsin digestion reveals a potential conformational change of PHF8 upon PIP2 binding. These observations identify the function of nuclear PIP2, and suggest that PIP2 contributes to the fine-tuning of rDNA transcription.

Abstract: Background and aims
Recent studies have suggested that heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) may play critical roles in cardiovascular disease. However, the effects of HSP70 on the development of atherosclerosis in apoE−/− mice remain largely unknown. This study was to investigate the role and potential mechanism of HSP70 in atherosclerosis.
Methods
HSP70 was overexpressed in apoE−/− mice and THP-1-derived macrophages with lentiviral vectors. Oil Red O, hematoxylin-eosin, and Masson staining were performed to evaluate atherosclerotic plaque in apoE−/− mice fed the Western type diet. Moreover, immunostaining was employed to detect the expression of relative proteins in aortic sinus. Reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to analyze the effect of Elk-1 on the promoter activity of ABCA1 and ABCG1; [3H] labeled cholesterol was used to assess the capacity of cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT).
Results
Our results showed that HSP70 increased lipid accumulation in arteries and promoted the formation of atherosclerotic lesion. The capacity of cholesterol efflux was reduced in peritoneal macrophages isolated from HSP70-overexpressed apoE−/− mice. The levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression were also reduced in the peritoneal macrophages and the aorta from apoE−/− mice in response to HSP70. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and ETS transcription factor (Elk-1) played a critical role in HSP70-induced downregulation ABCA1 and ABCG1. Further, HSP70 reduced RCT from macrophages to plasma, liver, and feces in apoE−/− mice.
Conclusions
HSP70 promotes the progression of atherosclerosis in apoE−/− mice by suppressing the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 through the JNK/Elk-1 pathway.

Abstract: Protective effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has been demonstrated. FFA4 (also known as GPR120; a G protein-coupled receptor) has been suggested to be a target of n-3 PUFA. FFA4 expression in hepatocytes has also been reported from liver biopsies in child fatty liver patients. In order to assess the functional role of FFA4 in hepatic steatosis, we used an in vitro model of liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated hepatocellular steatosis. FFA4 expression was confirmed in Hep3B and HepG2 human hepatoma cells. T0901317 (a specific LXR activator) induced lipid accumulation and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; a representative n-3 PUFA) inhibited lipid accumulation. This DHA-induced inhibition was blunted by treatment of AH7614 (a FFA4 antagonist) and by transfection of FFA4 siRNA. SREBP-1c (a key transcription factor of lipogenesis) was induced by treatment with T0901317, and SREBP-1c induction was also inhibited by DHA at mRNA and protein levels. DHA-induced suppression of SREBP-1c expression was also blunted by FFA4-knockdown. Furthermore, DHA inhibited T0901317-induced lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes from wild type mice, but not in those from FFA4 deficient mice. In addition, DHA-induced activations of Gq/11 proteins, CaMKK, and AMPK were found to be signaling components of the steatosis protective pathway. The results of this study suggest that n-3 PUFA protect hepatic steatosis by activating FFA4 in hepatocytes, and its signaling cascade sequentially involves FFA4, Gq/11 proteins, CaMKK, AMPK, and SREBP-1c suppression.

Cholesterol trafficking and raft-like membrane domain composition mediate scavenger receptor class B type 1-dependent lipid sensing in intestinal epithelial cells,

Abstract: Scavenger receptor Class B type 1 (SR-B1) is a lipid transporter and sensor. In intestinal epithelial cells, SR-B1-dependent lipid sensing is associated with SR-B1 recruitment in raft-like/ detergent-resistant membrane domains and interaction of its C-terminal transmembrane domain with plasma membrane cholesterol. To clarify the initiating events occurring during lipid sensing by SR-B1, we analyzed cholesterol trafficking and raft-like domain composition in intestinal epithelial cells expressing wild-type SR-B1 or the mutated form SR-B1-Q445A, defective in membrane cholesterol binding and signal initiation. These features of SR-B1 were found to influence both apical cholesterol efflux and intracellular cholesterol trafficking from plasma membrane to lipid droplets, and the lipid composition of raft-like domains. Lipidomic analysis revealed likely participation of d18:0/16:0 sphingomyelin and 16:0/0:0 lysophosphatidylethanolamine in lipid sensing by SR-B1. Proteomic analysis identified proteins, whose abundance changed in raft-like domains during lipid sensing, and these included molecules linked to lipid raft dynamics and signal transduction. These findings provide new insights into the role of SR-B1 in cellular cholesterol homeostasis and suggest molecular links between SR-B1-dependent lipid sensing and cell cholesterol and lipid droplet dynamics.

Abstract: Unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) are essential components of phospholipids that greatly contribute to the biophysical properties of cellular membranes. Biosynthesis of UFAs relies on a conserved family of iron-dependent fatty acid desaturases, whose representative in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is Ole1. OLE1 expression is tightly regulated to adapt UFA biosynthesis and lipid bilayer properties to changes in temperature, and in UFA or oxygen availability. Despite iron deficiency being the most extended nutritional disorder worldwide, very little is known about the mechanisms and the biological relevance of fatty acid desaturases regulation in response to iron starvation. In this report, we show that endoplasmic reticulum-anchored transcription factor Mga2 activates OLE1 transcription in response to nutritional and genetic iron deficiencies. Cells lacking MGA2 display low UFA levels and do not grow under iron-limited conditions, unless UFAs are supplemented or OLE1 is overexpressed. The proteasome, E3 ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 and the Cdc48Npl4/Ufd1 complex are required for OLE1 activation during iron depletion. Interestingly, Mga2 also activates the transcription of its own mRNA in response to iron deficiency, hypoxia, low temperature and low UFAs. MGA2 up-regulation contributes to increase OLE1 expression in these situations. These results reveal the mechanism of OLE1 regulation when iron is scarce and identify the MGA2 auto-regulation as a potential activation strategy in multiple stresses.

Abstract: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), a protein regulating the number of cell-surface LDL receptors (LDLR), circulates partially associated to plasma lipoproteins. How this interaction alters PCSK9 plasma levels is still unclear. In the present study, we took advantage of the availability of a large cohort of carriers of genetic HDL disorders to evaluate how HDL defects affect plasma PCSK9 levels and its distribution among lipoproteins. Plasma PCSK9 concentrations were determined by ELISA in carriers of mutations in LCAT, ABCA1, or APOAI genes, and lipoprotein distribution was analyzed by FPLC. Carriers of one or two mutations in the LCAT gene show plasma PCSK9 levels comparable to that of unaffected family controls (homozygotes, 159.4 ng/mL (124.9;243.3); heterozygotes, 180.3 ng/mL (127.6;251.5) and controls, 190.4 ng/mL (146.7;264.4); P for trend = 0.33). Measurement of PCSK9 in plasma of subjects carrying mutations in ABCA1 or APOAI genes confirmed normal values. When fractionated by FPLC, PCSK9 peaked in a region between LDL and HDL in control subjects. In carriers of all HDL defects, lipoprotein profile shows a strong reduction of HDL, but the distribution of PCSK9 was superimposable to that of controls. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that in genetically determined low HDL states plasma PCSK9 concentrations and lipoprotein distribution are preserved, thus suggesting that HDL may not be involved in PCSK9 transport in plasma.

Abstract: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal mRNA modification in eukaryotes. Loss of m6A demethylase FTO increases m6A levels and inhibits adipogenesis of preadipocytes. However, its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that silencing FTO inhibited adipogenesis of preadipocytes through impairing cell cycle progression at the early stage of adipogenesis. FTO knockdown markedly decreased the expression of CCNA2 and CDK2, crucial cell cycle regulators, leading to delayed entry of MDI-induced cells into G2 phase. Furthermore, the m6A levels of CCNA2 and CDK2 mRNA were significantly upregulated following FTO knockdown. m6A-binding protein YTHDF2 recognized and decayed methylated mRNAs of CCNA2 and CDK2, leading to decreased protein expression, thereby prolonging cell cycle progression and suppressing adipogenesis. Our work unravels that FTO regulates adipogenesis by controlling cell cycle progression in an m6A-YTHDF2 dependent manner, which provides insights into critical roles of m6A methylation in adipogenesis.

Abstract: Inflammatory disorders such as sepsis are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a key factor in the pathogenesis of severe inflammation. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the impact of arachidonic acid, omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, and n-3-derived lipid mediators 18R-HEPE and resolvin (Rv) E1 on mitochondrial function in experimental inflammation. The results revealed that, in contrast to n-6 and n-3 fatty acids, both 18R-HEPE and RvE1 possess anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Both mediators are able to restore inflammation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which is characterized by a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential, as well as an imbalance of mitochondrial fission and fusion. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial fission by Mdivi-1 and Dynasore reduces levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. These results suggest a novel functional mechanism for the beneficial effects of RvE1 in inflammatory reactions.

Abstract: Hydroperoxide lyases (HPLs) of the CYP74 family (P450 superfamily) are widely distributed enzymes in higher plants and are responsible for the stress-initiated accumulation of short-chain aldehydes. Fatty acid hydroperoxides serve as substrates for HPLs; however, details of the HPL-promoted conversion are still incompletely understood. In the present work, we report first time the micropreparative isolation and the NMR structural studies of fatty acid hemiacetal (TMS/TMS), the short-lived HPL product. With this aim, linoleic acid 9(S)‑hydroperoxide (9(S)‑HPOD) was incubated with recombinant melon hydroperoxide lyase (CmHPL, CYP74C2) in a biphasic system of water/hexane for 60 s at 0 °C, pH 4.0. The hexane layer was immediately decanted and vortexed with a trimethylsilylating mixture. Analysis by GC–MS revealed a major product, i.e. the bis-TMS derivative of a hemiacetal which was conclusively identified as 9‑hydroxy‑9‑[(1′E,3′Z)‑nonadienyloxy]‑nonanoic acid by NMR-spectroscopy. Further support for the hemiacetal structure was provided by detailed NMR-spectroscopic analysis of the bis-TMS hemiacetal generated from [13C18]9(S)‑HPOD in the presence of CmHPL. The results obtained provide incontrovertible evidence that the true products of the HPL group of enzymes are hemiacetals, and that the short-chain aldehydes are produced by their rapid secondary chain breakdown. Therefore, we suggest replacing the name “hydroperoxide lyase”, which does not reflect the factual isomerase (intramolecular oxidoreductase) activity, with “hemiacetal synthase” (HAS).

Abstract: Prep1 is a gene encoding for a homeodomain transcription factor which induces hepatic and muscular insulin resistance. In this study, we show that Prep1 hypomorphic heterozygous (Prep1i/+) mice, expressing low levels of protein, featured a 23% and a 25% reduction of total body lipid content and epididymal fat, respectively. The percentage of the small adipocytes (25–75 μm) was 30% higher in Prep1i/+ animals than in the WT, with a reciprocal difference in the large adipose cells (100–150 and >150 μm). Insulin-stimulated insulin receptor tyrosine and Akt serine phosphorylation markedly increased in Prep1i/+ mice, paralleled by 3-fold higher glucose uptake and a significant increase of proadipogenic genes such as C/EBPα, GLUT4, and FABP4. Moreover, T cells infiltration and TNF-α, IFNγ and leptin expression were reduced in adipose tissue from Prep1i/+ mice, while adiponectin levels were 2-fold higher. Furthermore, Prep1i/+ mature adipocytes released lower amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and higher amount of adiponectin compared to WT cells. Incubation of murine liver cell line (NMuLi) with conditioned media (CM) from mature adipocytes of Prep1i/+ mice improved glucose metabolism, while those from WT mice had no effect. Consistent with these data, Prep1 overexpression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes impaired adipogenesis and insulin signaling, and increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion. All these findings suggest that Prep1 silencing reduces inflammatory response and increases insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue. In addition, CM from mature adipocytes of Prep1i/+ mice improve metabolism in hepatic cells.

Abstract: Eicosanoids play a crucial role in inflammatory pain. However, there is very little knowledge about the contribution of oxidized linoleic acid metabolites in inflammatory pain and peripheral sensitization. Here, we identify 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-DiHOME), a cytochrome P450-derived linoleic acid metabolite, as crucial mediator of thermal hyperalgesia during inflammatory pain. We found 12,13-DiHOME in increased concentrations in peripheral nervous tissue during acute zymosan- and complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain. 12,13-DiHOME causes calcium transients in sensory neurons and sensitizes the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated intracellular calcium increases via protein kinase C, subsequently leading to enhanced TRPV1-dependent CGRP-release from sensory neurons. Peripheral injection of 12,13-DiHOME in vivo causes TRPV1-dependent thermal pain hypersensitivity. Finally, application of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)-inhibitor TPPU reduces 12,13-DiHOME concentrations in nervous tissue and reduces zymosan- and CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia in vivo. In conclusion, we identify a novel role for the lipid mediator 12,13-DiHOME in mediating thermal hyperalgesia during inflammatory pain and propose a novel mechanism that may explain the antihyperalgesic effects of sEH inhibitors in vivo.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate and compare the effects of two common dietary phytosterols, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol, in altering lipid metabolism and attenuating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
Methods
Stigmasterol and β-sitosterol were administered to mice at 0.4% in a high-fat western-style diet (HFWD) for 17 weeks.
Results
Stigmasterol and β-sitosterol significantly ameliorated HFWD-induced fatty liver and metabolic abnormalities, including elevated levels of hepatic total lipids, triacylglycerols, cholesterol and liver histopathology. Both phytosterols decreased the levels of intestinal bile acids, accompanied by markedly increased fecal lipid levels. In addition, they altered the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. β-Sitosterol was less effective in affecting most of these parameters. Lipidomic analysis of liver and serum samples showed that stigmasterol prevented the HFWD-induced elevation of some di- and triacylglycerol species and lowering of some phospholipid species. Stigmasterol also decreased serum levels of ceramides.
Conclusion
Stigmasterol and β-sitosterol, at a dose corresponding to that suggested for humans by the FDA for lowering cholesterol levels, are shown to alleviate HFWD-induced NAFLD. Stigmasterol was more effective than β-sitosterol, possibly because of its suppression of hepatic lipogenic gene expression and modulation of circulating ceramide levels.

Abstract: The ABC lipid transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1, are essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis in cells such as macrophages by exporting excess cholesterol to extracellular acceptors. These transporters are highly regulated at the post-translational level, including protein ubiquitination. Our aim was to investigate the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD1, recently identified as associated with ABCG1, on ABCG1 and ABCA1 protein levels and cholesterol export function. Here, we show that HECTD1 protein is widely expressed in a range of human and murine primary cells and cell lines, including macrophages, neuronal cells and insulin secreting β-cells. siRNA knockdown of HECTD1 unexpectedly decreased overexpressed ABCG1 protein levels and cell growth, but increased native ABCA1 protein in CHO-K1 cells. Knockdown of HECTD1 in unloaded THP-1 macrophages did not affect ABCG1 but significantly increased ABCA1 protein levels, in wild-type as well as THP-1 cells that do not express ABCG1. Cholesterol export from macrophages to apoA-I over time was increased after knockdown of HECTD1, however these effects were not sustained in cholesterol-loaded cells. In conclusion, we have identified a new candidate, the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD1, that may be involved in the regulation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol export from unloaded macrophages to apoA-I. The exact mechanism by which this ligase affects this pathway remains to be elucidated.

Abstract: CDP diacylglycerol synthase (CDS) catalyses the conversion of phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-diacylglycerol, an essential intermediate in the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin and phosphatidylinositol (PI). CDS activity has been identified in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells apparently encoded by two highly-related genes, CDS1 and CDS2. Cardiolipin is exclusively synthesised in mitochondria and recent studies in cardiomyocytes suggest that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 (PGC-1α and β) serve as transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and up-regulate the transcription of the CDS1 gene. Here we have examined whether CDS1 is responsible for the mitochondrial CDS activity. We report that differentiation of H9c2 cells with retinoic acid towards cardiomyocytes is accompanied by increased expression of mitochondrial proteins, oxygen consumption, and expression of the PA/PI binding protein, PITPNC1, and CDS1 immunoreactivity. Both CDS1 immunoreactivity and CDS activity were found in mitochondria of H9c2 cells as well as in rat heart, liver and brain mitochondria. However, the CDS1 immunoreactivity was traced to a peripheral p55 cross-reactive mitochondrial protein and the mitochondrial CDS activity was due to a peripheral mitochondrial protein, TAMM41, not an integral membrane protein as expected for CDS1. TAMM41 is the mammalian equivalent of the recently identified yeast protein, Tam41. Knockdown of TAMM41 resulted in decreased mitochondrial CDS activity, decreased cardiolipin levels and a decrease in oxygen consumption. We conclude that the CDS activity present in mitochondria is mainly due to TAMM41, which is required for normal mitochondrial function.

Abstract: Phosphoinositides are bioactive lipids essential in the regulation of cell signaling as well as cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics. Their metabolism is highly active in blood platelets where they play a critical role during activation, at least through two well identified pathways involving phospholipase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). Here, using a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method recently developed, we monitored for the first time the profiling of phosphatidylinositol (PI), PIP, PIP2 and PIP3 molecular species (fatty-acyl profiles) in human and mouse platelets during the course of stimulation by thrombin and collagen-related peptide. Furthermore, using class IA PI3K p110α or p110β deficient mouse platelets and a pharmacological inhibitor, we show the crucial role of p110β and the more subtle role of p110α in the production of PIP3 molecular species following stimulation. This comprehensive platelet phosphoinositides profiling provides important resources for future studies and reveals new information on phosphoinositides biology, similarities and differences in mouse and human platelets and unexpected dramatic increase in low-abundance molecular species of PIP2 during stimulation, opening new perspectives in phosphoinositide signaling in platelets.

Abstract: Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the tafazzin gene (TAZ), which encodes the transacylase that remodels the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL). While most BTHS patients exhibit pronounced skeletal myopathy, the mechanisms linking defective CL remodeling and skeletal myopathy have not been determined. In this study, we constructed a CRISPR-generated stable tafazzin knockout (TAZ-KO) C2C12 myoblast cell line. TAZ-KO cells exhibit mitochondrial deficits consistent with other models of BTHS, including accumulation of monolyso-CL (MLCL), decreased mitochondrial respiration, and increased mitochondrial ROS production. Additionally, tafazzin deficiency was associated with impairment of myocyte differentiation. Future studies should determine whether alterations in myogenic determination contribute to the skeletal myopathy observed in BTHS patients. The BTHS myoblast model will enable studies to elucidate mechanisms by which defective CL remodeling interferes with normal myocyte differentiation and skeletal muscle ontogenesis.

Abstract: The sterol metabolome of Acanthamoeba castellanii (Ac) yielded 25 sterols. Substrate screening of cloned AcCYP51 revealed obtusifoliol as the natural substrate which converts to ∆8,14-sterol (<95%). The combination of [2H3-methyl]methionine incubation to intact cultures showing C28-ergosterol incorporates 2-2H atoms and C29-7-dehydroporiferasterol incorporates 5 2H-atoms, the natural distribution of sterols, CYP51 and previously published sterol methyltransferase (SMT) data indicate separate ∆24(28)- and ∆25(27)-olefin pathways to C28- and C29-sterol products from the protosterol cycloartenol. In cell-based culture, we observed a marked change in sterol compositions during the growth and encystment phases monitored microscopically and by trypan blue staining; trophozoites possess C28/C29-∆5,7-sterols, viable encysted cells (mature cyst) possess mostly C29-∆5-sterol and non-viable encysted cells possess C28/C29-∆5,7-sterols that turnover variably from stress to 6-methyl aromatic sterols associated with changed membrane fluidity affording lysis. An incompatible fit of steroidal aromatics in membranes was confirmed using the yeast sterol auxotroph GL7. Only viable cysts, including those treated with inhibitor, can excyst into trophozoites. 25-Azacycloartanol or voriconazole that target SMT and CYP51, respectively, are potent enzyme inhibitors in the nanomolar range against the cloned enzymes and amoeba cells. At minimum amoebicidal concentration of inhibitor amoeboid cells rapidly convert to encysted cells unable to excyst. The correlation between stage-specific sterol compositions and the physiological effects of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors suggests that amoeba fitness is controlled mainly by developmentally-regulated changes in the phytosterol B-ring; paired interference in the ∆5,7-sterol biosynthesis (to ∆5,7) - metabolism (to ∆5 or 6-methyl aromatic) congruence during cell proliferation and encystment could be a source of therapeutic intervention for Acanthamoeba infections.

Abstract: Some studies have shown that transplanted fat tissues usually cannot survive for long if adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are removed from the tissues in advance. It is more meaningful to explore the mechanism mediating survival and differentiation of ADSCs in the transplanted microenvironment. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to be one of the energy receptors that regulate many aspects of cellular metabolism. AMPK activation has been implicated in models of adult ischemic injury, but the mechanism and the regulating effects of AMPK on survival and adipogenesis of transplanted ADSCs are still little known. In this study, we simulated the transplanted microenvironment using oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to test the survival and adipogenesis of ADSCs. We found that OGD treatment triggered significant apoptosis and promoted autophagy. Simultaneously, OGD hindered the differentiation of ADSCs into mature adipocytes. After inhibiting AMPK, the OGD-induced apoptosis rate increased but autophagy was inhibited. The adipogenesis level also decreased. To show that the effects of AMPK on apoptosis and adipogenesis were autophagy-dependent, we pre-inhibited or pre-promoted autophagy with siATG7 or rapamycin while blocking AMPK. We found that inhibiting or improving autophagy exacerbated or alleviated the role of AMPK prohibition in apoptosis and adipogenesis. Furthermore, we showed that AMPK inhibition significantly lowered ULK1 activity but promoted mTOR activity, so that to inhibit autophagy. Our study shows that AMPK plays a protective role in maintaining survival and adipogenesis of OGD-challenged ADSCs partly by positively regulating autophagy. AMPK positively regulates autophagy by inhibiting mTOR but promoting ULK1 activity in OGD condition.

Abstract: Adiponectin (AdipoQ) is an adipocyte-derived hormone with positive function on systemic glucose and lipid metabolism. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is emerging as a vital regulator of adipogenesis. However, AdipoQ-related lncRNAs in lipid metabolism have not been explored. Here, AdipoQ antisense (AS) lncRNA was first identified, and we further found that it inhibited adipogenesis. The half-life of AdipoQ AS lncRNA was 10 h, whereas that of AdipoQ mRNA was 4 h. During adipogenic differentiation, AdipoQ AS lncRNA translocated from nucleus to cytoplasm. AdipoQ AS lncRNA and AdipoQ mRNA formed an RNA duplex. Moreover, AdipoQ AS lncRNA delivered via injection of adenovirus expressing AdipoQ AS lncRNA decreases white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) and liver triglycerides (TG) in mice consuming a high fat diet (HFD). Interestingly, the non-overlapping region of AdipoQ AS lncRNA improved serum glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD mice, but not AdipoQ AS lncRNA. In conclusion, AdipoQ AS lncRNA transfer from nucleus to cytoplasm inhibits adipogenesis through formation of an AdipoQ AS lncRNA/AdipoQ mRNA duplex to suppress the translation of AdipoQ mRNA. Taken together, we suggest that AdipoQ AS lncRNA is a novel therapeutic target for obesity-related metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are involved in binding and storing hydrophobic ligands such as long-chain fatty acids, as well as transporting them to the appropriate compartments in the cell. Epidermal fatty acid-binding protein (FABP5) is an intracellular lipid-binding protein that is abundantly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. Previous studies have revealed that the FABP5 expression level is closely related to malignancy in various types of cancer. However, its precise functions in the metabolisms of cancer cells remain unclear. Here, we revealed that FABP5 knockdown significantly induced downregulation of the genes expression, such as hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), elongation of long-chain fatty acid member 6 (Elovl6), and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1), which are involved in altered lipid metabolism, lipolysis, and de novo FA synthesis in highly aggressive prostate and breast cancer cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that FABP5 induced inflammation and cytokine production through the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway activated by reactive oxygen species and protein kinase C in PC-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, FABP5 might regulate lipid quality and/or quantity to promote aggressiveness such as cell growth, invasiveness, survival, and inflammation in prostate and breast cancer cells. In the present study, we have revealed for the first time that high expression of FABP5 plays a critical role in alterations of lipid metabolism, leading to cancer development and metastasis in highly aggressive prostate and breast cancer cells.

Abstract: n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) might regulate metabolism by lowering endocannabinoid levels. We examined time-dependent changes in adipose tissue levels of endocannabinoids as well as in parameters of glucose homeostasis induced by n-3 PUFA in dietary-obese mice, and compared these results with the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) subjects. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 8, 16 or 24 weeks a high-fat diet alone (cHF) or supplemented with n-3 PUFA (cHF + F). Overweight/obese, T2DM patients on metformin therapy were given for 24 weeks corn oil (Placebo; 5 g/day) or n-3 PUFA concentrate as above (Omega-3; 5 g/day). Endocannabinoids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry. Compared to cHF-fed controls, the cHF + F mice consistently reduced 2-arachidonoylglycerol (up to ~2-fold at week 24) and anandamide (~2-fold) in adipose tissue, while the levels of endocannabinoid-related anti-inflammatory molecules N-eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA) and N-docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA) increased more than ~10-fold and ~8-fold, respectively. At week 24, the cHF + F mice improved glucose tolerance and fasting blood glucose, the latter being positively correlated with adipose 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels only in obese cHF-fed controls, like fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. In the patients, n-3 PUFA failed to reduce 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide levels in adipose tissue and serum, but they increased both adipose tissue and serum levels of EPEA and DHEA. In conclusion, the inability of n-3 PUFA to reduce adipose tissue and serum levels of classical endocannabinoids might contribute to a lack of beneficial effects of these lipids on glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients.

Abstract: Alternative splicing has been widely demonstrated to function as pivotal regulation in specifying cellular fates and biological functions. The relative expression or cellular localization of a splicing factor constitutes an important mechanism in spatiotemporal programming of cell- and stage-specific splicing profiles. In this study, results of deep RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses first revealed the reprogrammed splicing profile and reduced expression of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) throughout the development of brown adipose tissue (BAT). A gradual increase in the exon 10-skipped SRPK1 transcript, a potential target of a nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) mechanism, was noted during brown adipogenesis. Elevated RBM4a constituted the regulatory mechanism that led to skipping of SRPK1 exon 10. Moreover, brown adipogenesis-induced upregulation of microRNA (miR)-485 interfered with SRPK1 expression by targeting its 3′-untranslated region (UTR). Depletion of endogenous SRPK1 enhanced the development of C3H10T1/2 cells toward brown adipocytes. Taking our results together, multiple post-transcriptional regulations reduced SRPK1 expression, which subsequently affected brown adipogenesis.

Abstract: Cancer cells driven by the Ras oncogene scavenge unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) from their environment to counter nutrient stress. The human group X secreted phospholipase A2 (hGX sPLA2) releases FAs from membrane phospholipids, stimulates lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis in Ras-driven triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and enables their survival during starvation. Here we examined the role of LDs, induced by hGX sPLA2 and unsaturated FAs, in protection of TNBC cells against nutrient stress. We found that hGX sPLA2 releases a mixture of unsaturated FAs, including ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), from TNBC cells. Starvation-induced breakdown of LDs induced by low micromolar concentrations of unsaturated FAs, including PUFAs, was associated with protection from cell death. Interestingly, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) contributed to LD breakdown during starvation, but it was not required for the pro-survival effects of hGX sPLA2 and unsaturated FAs. High micromolar concentrations of PUFAs, but not OA, induced oxidative stress-dependent cell death in TNBC cells. Inhibition of triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis suppressed LD biogenesis and potentiated PUFA-induced cell damage. On the contrary, stimulation of LD biogenesis by hGX sPLA2 and suppression of LD breakdown by ATGL depletion reduced PUFA-induced oxidative stress and cell death. Finally, lipidomic analyses revealed that sequestration of PUFAs in LDs by sPLA2-induced TAG remodelling and retention of PUFAs in LDs by inhibition of ATGL-mediated TAG lipolysis protect from PUFA lipotoxicity. LDs are thus antioxidant and pro-survival organelles that guard TNBC cells against nutrient and lipotoxic stress and emerge as attractive targets for novel therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Carnitine/choline acyltransferases play diverse roles in energy metabolism and neuronal signalling. Our knowledge of their evolutionary relationships, important for functional understanding, is incomplete. Therefore, we aimed to determine the evolutionary relationships of these eukaryotic transferases. We performed extensive phylogenetic and intron position analyses. We found that mammalian intramitochondrial CPT2 is most closely related to cytosolic yeast carnitine transferases (Sc-YAT1 and 2), whereas the other members of the family are related to intraorganellar yeast Sc-CAT2. Therefore, the cytosolically active CPT1 more closely resembles intramitochondrial ancestors than CPT2. The choline acetyltransferase is closely related to carnitine acetyltransferase and shows lower evolutionary rates than long chain acyltransferases. In the CPT1 family several duplications occurred during animal radiation, leading to the isoforms CPT1A, CPT1B and CPT1C. In addition, we found five CPT1-like genes in Caenorhabditis elegans that strongly group to the CPT1 family. The long branch leading to mammalian brain isoform CPT1C suggests that either strong positive or relaxed evolution has taken place on this node. The presented evolutionary delineation of carnitine/choline acyltransferases adds to current knowledge on their functions and provides tangible leads for further experimental research.

Abstract: The thermogenic activities of brown and beige adipocytes can be exploited to reduce energy surplus and counteract obesity. Recent RNA sequencing studies have uncovered a number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) uniquely expressed in white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT), but whether and how these lncRNAs function in adipogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of a novel brown adipocyte-enriched LncRNA (AK079912), and its nuclear localization, function and regulation. The expression of AK079912 increases during brown preadipocyte differentiation and in response to cold-stimulated browning of white adipocytes. Knockdown of AK079912 inhibits brown preadipocyte differentiation, manifested by reductions in lipid accumulation and down-regulation of adipogenic and BAT-specific genes. Conversely, ectopic expression of AK079912 in white preadipocytes up-regulates the expression of genes involved in thermogenesis. Mechanistically, inhibition of AK079912 reduces mitochondrial copy number and protein levels of mitochondria electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, whereas AK079912 overexpression increases the levels of ETC proteins. Lastly, reporter and pharmacological assays identify Pparγ as an upstream regulator of AK079912. These results provide new insights into the function of non-coding RNAs in brown adipogenesis and regulating browning of white adipocytes.

Abstract: GPR119 receptor has been proposed as a metabolic regulator playing a pivotal role in the modulation of glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes. GPR119 was identified on pancreatic β cells and its ligands have the ability to enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was shown to potentiate GSIS and our present studies indicate that 2-methoxy-lysophosphatidylcholine (2-OMe-LPC) analogues, unable to undergo 1→2 acyl migration, stimulate GSIS from murine βTC-3 pancreatic cells even more efficiently. Moreover, biological assays in engineered Tango™ GPR119-bla U2OS cells were carried out to ascertain the agonist activity of 2-OMe-LPC at GPR119. 2-OMe-LPC possessing in sn-1 position the residues of myristic, palmitic, stearic and oleic acid were also evaluated as factors regulating [Ca2+]i mobilization and cAMP levels. Extension of these studies to R- and S-enantiomers of 14:0 2-OMe-LPC revealed that the overall impact on GSIS does not depend on chirality, however, the intracellular calcium mobilization data show that the R enantiomer is significantly more active than S one. Taking into account differences in chemical structure between various native LPCs and their 2-methoxy counterparts the possible binding mode of 2-OMe-LPC to the GPR119 receptor was determined using molecular modeling approach.
