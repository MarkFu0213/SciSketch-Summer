Abstract: Summary
In Drosophila, it is thought that peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) SA and LC structurally discriminate between bacterial peptidoglycans with lysine (Lys) or diaminopimelic (DAP) acid, respectively, thus inducing differential antimicrobial transcription response. Here, we find that accessibility to PG at the cell wall plays a central role in immunity to infection. When wall teichoic acids (WTAs) are genetically removed from S. aureus (Lys type) and Bacillus subtilis (DAP type), thus increasing accessibility, the binding of both PGRPs to either bacterium is increased. PGRP-SA and -LC double mutant flies are more susceptible to infection with both WTA-less bacteria. In addition, WTA-less bacteria grow better in PGRP-SA/-LC double mutant flies. Finally, infection with WTA-less bacteria abolishes any differential activation of downstream antimicrobial transcription. Our results indicate that accessibility to cell wall PG is a major factor in PGRP-mediated immunity and may be the cause for discrimination between classes of pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Two major functions of the epigenome are to regulate gene expression and to suppress transposons. It is unclear how these functions are balanced during physiological challenges requiring tissue regeneration, where exquisite coordination of gene expression is essential. Transcriptomic analysis of seven time points following partial hepatectomy identified the epigenetic regulator UHRF1, which is essential for DNA methylation, as dynamically expressed during liver regeneration in mice. UHRF1 deletion in hepatocytes (Uhrf1HepKO) caused genome-wide DNA hypomethylation but, surprisingly, had no measurable effect on gene or transposon expression or liver homeostasis. Partial hepatectomy of Uhrf1HepKO livers resulted in early and sustained activation of proregenerative genes and enhanced liver regeneration. This was attributed to redistribution of H3K27me3 from promoters to transposons, effectively silencing them and, consequently, alleviating repression of liver regeneration genes, priming them for expression in Uhrf1HepKO livers. Thus, epigenetic compensation safeguards the genome against transposon activation, indirectly affecting gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to disease progression and treatment failure in human cancers. The balance among self-renewal, differentiation, and senescence determines the expansion or progressive exhaustion of CSCs. Targeting these processes might lead to novel anticancer therapies. Here, we uncover a novel link between BRD4, mitochondrial dynamics, and self-renewal of prostate CSCs. Targeting BRD4 by genetic knockdown or chemical inhibitors blocked mitochondrial fission and caused CSC exhaustion and loss of tumorigenic capability. Depletion of CSCs occurred in multiple prostate cancer models, indicating a common vulnerability and dependency on mitochondrial dynamics. These effects depended on rewiring of the BRD4-driven transcription and repression of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff). Knockdown of Mff reproduced the effects of BRD4 inhibition, whereas ectopic Mff expression rescued prostate CSCs from exhaustion. This novel concept of targeting mitochondrial plasticity in CSCs through BRD4 inhibition provides a new paradigm for developing more effective treatment strategies for prostate cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrent epidemics of drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus illustrate the rapid lapse of antibiotic efficacy following clinical implementation. Over the last decade, community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has emerged as a dominant cause of infections, and this problem is amplified by the hyper-virulent nature of these isolates. Herein, we report the discovery of a fungal metabolite, apicidin, as an innovative means to counter both resistance and virulence. Owing to its breadth and specificity as a quorum-sensing inhibitor, apicidin antagonizes all MRSA agr systems in a non-biocidal manner. In skin challenge experiments, the apicidin-mediated abatement of MRSA pathogenesis corresponds with quorum-sensing inhibition at in vivo sites of infection. Additionally, we show that apicidin attenuates MRSA-induced disease by potentiating innate effector responses, particularly through enhanced neutrophil accumulation and function at cutaneous challenge sites. Together, these results indicate that apicidin treatment represents a strategy to limit MRSA virulence and promote host defense.

Abstract: Summary
Orchestrating cell-cycle-dependent mRNA oscillations is critical to cell proliferation in multicellular organisms. Even though our understanding of cell-cycle-regulated transcription has improved significantly over the last three decades, the mechanisms remain untested in vivo. Unbiased transcriptomic profiling of G0, G1-S, and S-G2-M sorted cells from FUCCI mouse embryos suggested a central role for E2Fs in the control of cell-cycle-dependent gene expression. The analysis of gene expression and E2F-tagged knockin mice with tissue imaging and deep-learning tools suggested that post-transcriptional mechanisms universally coordinate the nuclear accumulation of E2F activators (E2F3A) and canonical (E2F4) and atypical (E2F8) repressors during the cell cycle in vivo. In summary, we mapped the spatiotemporal expression of sentinel E2F activators and canonical and atypical repressors at the single-cell level in vivo and propose that two distinct E2F modules relay the control of gene expression in cells actively cycling (E2F3A-8-4) and exiting the cycle (E2F3A-4) during mammalian development.

Abstract: Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) develop through the continuous interaction with intestinal antigens such as commensal microbiome and diet. However, their respective roles and mutual interactions in the development of IELs are largely unknown. Here, we showed that dietary antigens regulate the development of the majority of CD8αβ IELs in the small intestine and the absence of commensal microbiota particularly during the weaning period, delay the development of IELs. When we tested specific dietary components, such as wheat or combined corn, soybean and yeast, they were dependent on commensal bacteria for the timely development of diet-induced CD8αβ IELs. In addition, supplementation of intestinal antigens later in life was inefficient for the full induction of CD8αβ IELs. Overall, our findings suggest that early exposure to commensal bacteria is important for the proper development of dietary antigen-dependent immune repertoire in the gut.

Abstract: Coordination of intracellular Ca2+ signaling in parotid acini is crucial for controlling the secretion of primary saliva. Previous work from our lab has demonstrated acidic-organelle Ca2+ release as a participant in agonist-evoked signaling dynamics of the parotid acinar cell. Furthermore, results implicated a potential role for the potent Ca2+ releasing second messenger NAADP in these events. The current study interrogated a direct role of NAADP for Ca2+ signaling in the parotid salivary gland acinar cell. Use of live-cell Ca2+ imaging, patch-clamp methods, and confocal microscopy revealed for the first time NAADP can evoke or enhance Ca2+ dynamics in parotid acini. These results were compared with pancreatic acini, a morphologically similar cell type previously shown to display NAADP-dependent Ca2+ signals. Findings presented here may be relevant in establishing new therapeutic targets for those suffering from xerostomia produced by hypofunctioning salivary glands.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) plays a central role in mitochondrial protein quality control by degrading misfolded proteins. Using genetic and chemical approaches, we showed that hyperactivation of the protease selectively kills cancer cells, independently of p53 status, by selective degradation of its respiratory chain protein substrates and disrupts mitochondrial structure and function, while it does not affect non-malignant cells. We identified imipridones as potent activators of ClpP. Through biochemical studies and crystallography, we show that imipridones bind ClpP non-covalently and induce proteolysis by diverse structural changes. Imipridones are presently in clinical trials. Our findings suggest a general concept of inducing cancer cell lethality through activation of mitochondrial proteolysis.

Abstract: Summary
KDM1A-mediated H3K4 demethylation is a well-established mechanism underlying transcriptional gene repression, but its role in gene activation is less clear. Here, we report a critical function and mechanism of action of KDM1A in glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated gene transcription. Biochemical purification of the nuclear GR complex revealed KDM1A as an integral component. In cell-free assays, GR modulates KDM1A-catalyzed H3K4 progressive demethylation by limiting the loss of H3K4me1. Similarly, in cells, KDM1A binds to most GR binding sites in the genome, where it removes preprogrammed H3K4me2 but leaves H3K4me1 untouched. Blocking KDM1A catalytic activity prevents H3K4me2 removal, severely impairs GR binding to chromatin, and dysregulates GR-targeted genes. Taken together, these data suggest KDM1A-mediated H3K4me2 demethylation at GRBSs promotes GR binding and plays an important role in glucocorticoid-induced gene transcription, broadening the mechanisms that contribute to nuclear receptor-mediated gene activation.

Abstract: Summary
VPS10P domain receptors emerge as central regulators of intracellular protein sorting in neurons with relevance for various brain pathologies. Here, we identified a role for the family member SorCS2 in protection of neurons from oxidative stress and epilepsy-induced cell death. We show that SorCS2 acts as sorting receptor that sustains cell surface expression of the neuronal amino acid transporter EAAT3 to facilitate import of cysteine, required for synthesis of the reactive oxygen species scavenger glutathione. Lack of SorCS2 causes depletion of EAAT3 from the plasma membrane and impairs neuronal cysteine uptake. As a consequence, SorCS2-deficient mice exhibit oxidative brain damage that coincides with enhanced neuronal cell death and increased mortality during epilepsy. Our findings highlight a protective role for SorCS2 in neuronal stress response and provide a possible explanation for upregulation of this receptor seen in surviving neurons of the human epileptic brain.

Abstract: Summary
Consolidation studies show that, over time, memory recall becomes independent of the medial temporal lobes. Multiple lines of research show that the medial frontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), is involved with contextual information processing and remote recall. We hypothesize that interactions between the ACC and hippocampal area CA1 will change as memories became more remote. Animals are re-exposed to multiple environments at different retention intervals. During remote recall, ACC-CA1 theta coherence increases, with the ACC leading area CA1. ACC theta regulates unit spike timing, gamma oscillations, and ensemble and single-neuron information coding in CA1. Over the course of consolidation, the strength and prevalence of ACC theta modulation grow, leading to richer environmental context representations in CA1. These data are consistent with the transference of contextual memory dependence to the ACC and indicate that remote memories are retrieved via ACC-driven oscillatory coupling with CA1.

Abstract: Summary
iPSC-derived human neurons are expected to revolutionize studies on brain diseases, but their functional heterogeneity still poses a problem. Key sources of heterogeneity are the different cell culture systems used. We show that an optimized autaptic culture system, with single neurons on astrocyte feeder islands, is well suited to culture, and we analyze human iPSC-derived neurons in a standardized, systematic, and reproducible manner. Using classically differentiated and transcription factor-induced human glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, we demonstrate that key features of neuronal morphology and function, including dendrite structure, synapse number, membrane properties, synaptic transmission, and short-term plasticity, can be assessed with substantial throughput and reproducibility. We propose our optimized autaptic culture system as a tool to study functional features of human neurons, particularly in the context of disease phenotypes and experimental therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E is nuclear and cytoplasmic where it plays roles in export and translation of specific transcripts, respectively. When we were studying its mRNA export activity, we unexpectedly discovered that eIF4E drives the protein expression of elements of the 3′-end core cleavage complex involved in cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA), including CPSF3, the enzyme responsible for cleavage, as well as its co-factors CPSF1, CPSF2, CPSF4, Symplekin, WDR33, and FIP1L1. Using multiple strategies, we demonstrate that eIF4E stimulates 3′-end cleavage of selected RNAs. eIF4E physically interacts with CPSF3, CPSF1, and uncleaved target RNA, suggesting it acts directly and indirectly on the pathway. Through these effects, eIF4E can generate better substrates for its mRNA export and translation activities. Thus, we identified an unanticipated function for eIF4E in 3′-end processing of specific target RNAs, and this function could potentially affect the expression of a broad range of oncoproteins.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage response (DDR) involves dramatic transcriptional alterations, the mechanisms of which remain ill defined. Here, we show that following genotoxic stress, the RNA-binding motif protein 7 (RBM7) stimulates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription and promotes cell viability by activating the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) via its release from the inhibitory 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP). This is mediated by activation of p38MAPK, which triggers enhanced binding of RBM7 with core subunits of 7SK snRNP. In turn, P-TEFb relocates to chromatin to induce transcription of short units, including key DDR genes and multiple classes of non-coding RNAs. Critically, interfering with the axis of RBM7 and P-TEFb provokes cellular hypersensitivity to DNA-damage-inducing agents due to activation of apoptosis. Our work uncovers the importance of stress-dependent stimulation of Pol II pause release, which enables a pro-survival transcriptional response that is crucial for cell fate upon genotoxic insult.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotic cells, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with RNAs to form ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNA granules) that have long been thought to regulate RNA fate or activity. Emerging evidence suggests that some RBPs not only bind RNA but also possess enzymatic activity related to ubiquitin regulation, raising important questions of whether these RBP-formed RNA granules regulate ubiquitin signaling and related biological functions. Here, we show that Drosophila Otu binds RNAs and coalesces to membrane-less biomolecular condensates via its intrinsically disordered low-complexity domain, and coalescence represents a functional state for Otu exerting deubiquitinase activity. Notably, coalescence-mediated enzymatic activity of Otu is positively regulated by its bound RNAs and co-partner Bam. Further genetic analysis reveals that the Otu/Bam deubiquitinase complex and dTraf6 constitute a feedback loop to maintain intestinal immune homeostasis during aging, thereby controlling longevity. Thus, regulated biomolecular condensates may represent a mechanism that controls dynamic enzymatic activities and related biological processes.

Abstract: Summary
Many metazoan genes express alternative long 3′ UTR isoforms in the nervous system, but their functions remain largely unclear. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Dscam1 gene generates short and long (Dscam1-L) 3′ UTR isoforms because of alternative polyadenylation (APA). Here, we found that the RNA-binding protein Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Visual System (Elav) impacts Dscam1 biogenesis at two levels, including regulation of long 3′ UTR biogenesis and skipping of an upstream exon (exon 19). MinION long-read sequencing confirmed the connectivity of this alternative splicing event to the long 3′ UTR. Knockdown or CRISPR deletion of Dscam1-L impaired axon outgrowth in Drosophila. The Dscam1 long 3′ UTR was found to be required for correct Elav-mediated skipping of exon 19. Elav thus co-regulates APA and alternative splicing to generate specific Dscam1 transcripts that are essential for neural development. This coupling of APA to alternative splicing might represent a new class of regulated RNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is associated with increased risk for fragility fractures. However, the cellular mechanisms are unknown. Using a translational approach combining RNA sequencing and cellular analyses, we investigated bone marrow stromal stem cells (BM-MSCs) of 54 men divided into lean, overweight, and obese groups on the basis of BMI. Compared with BM-MSCs obtained from lean, obese BM-MSCs exhibited a shift of molecular phenotype toward committed adipocytic progenitors and increased expression of metabolic genes involved in glycolytic and oxidoreductase activity. Interestingly, compared with paired samples of peripheral adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (AT-MSCs), insulin signaling of obese BM-MSCs was enhanced and accompanied by increased abundance of insulin receptor positive (IR+) and leptin receptor positive (LEPR+) cells in BM-MSC cultures. Their hyper-activated metabolic state was accompanied by an accelerated senescence phenotype. Our data provide a plausible explanation for the bone fragility in obesity caused by enhanced insulin signaling leading to accelerated metabolic senescence of BM-MSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Asprosin is a fasting-induced hormone that promotes glucose production in the liver and stimulates appetite in the hypothalamus by activating the cAMP signaling pathway via an unknown G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). However, the bona fide receptor of Asprosin is unclear. Here, we have identified that the olfactory receptor OLFR734 acts as a receptor of Asprosin to modulate hepatic glucose production. Olfr734 knockout mice show a blunted response to Asprosin, including attenuated cAMP levels and hepatic glucose production, and improved insulin sensitivity. As Olfr734 deficiency dramatically attenuates both fasting and high-fat-diet-induced glucose production, our results demonstrate a critical role of OLFR734 as a receptor of Asprosin to maintain glucose homeostasis during fasting and in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy facilitates the adaptation to nutritional stress. Here, we show that short-term starvation of cultured cells or mice caused the autophagy-dependent cellular release of acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP, also known as diazepam-binding inhibitor, DBI) and consequent ACBP-mediated feedback inhibition of autophagy. Importantly, ACBP levels were elevated in obese patients and reduced in anorexia nervosa. In mice, systemic injection of ACBP protein inhibited autophagy, induced lipogenesis, reduced glycemia, and stimulated appetite as well as weight gain. We designed three approaches to neutralize ACBP, namely, inducible whole-body knockout, systemic administration of neutralizing antibodies, and induction of antiACBP autoantibodies in mice. ACBP neutralization enhanced autophagy, stimulated fatty acid oxidation, inhibited appetite, reduced weight gain in the context of a high-fat diet or leptin deficiency, and accelerated weight loss in response to dietary changes. In conclusion, neutralization of ACBP might constitute a strategy for treating obesity and its co-morbidities.

Abstract: Summary
The awakening of the genome after fertilization is a cornerstone of animal development. However, the mechanisms that activate the silent genome after fertilization are poorly understood. Here, we show that transcriptional competency is regulated by Brd4- and P300-dependent histone acetylation in zebrafish. Live imaging of transcription revealed that genome activation, beginning at the miR-430 locus, is gradual and stochastic. We show that genome activation does not require slowdown of the cell cycle and is regulated through the translation of maternally inherited mRNAs. Among these, the enhancer regulators P300 and Brd4 can prematurely activate transcription and restore transcriptional competency when maternal mRNA translation is blocked, whereas inhibition of histone acetylation blocks genome activation. We conclude that P300 and Brd4 are sufficient to trigger genome-wide transcriptional competency by regulating histone acetylation on the first zygotic genes in zebrafish. This mechanism is critical for initiating zygotic development and developmental reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
The epigenetic information present in mammalian gametes and whether it is transmitted to the progeny are relatively unknown. We find that many promoters in mouse sperm are occupied by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and Mediator. The same promoters are accessible in GV and MII oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Sperm distal ATAC-seq sites containing motifs for various transcription factors are conserved in monkeys and humans. ChIP-seq analyses confirm that Foxa1, ERα, and AR occupy distal enhancers in sperm. Accessible sperm enhancers containing H3.3 and H2A.Z are also accessible in oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Furthermore, their interactions with promoters in the gametes persist during early development. Sperm- or oocyte-specific interactions mediated by CTCF and cohesin are only present in the paternal or maternal chromosomes, respectively, in the zygote and 2-cell stages. These interactions converge in both chromosomes by the 8-cell stage. Thus, mammalian gametes contain complex patterns of 3D interactions that can be transmitted to the zygote after fertilization.

Abstract: Summary
Syntaxin 17 (Stx17) has been implicated in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Here, we report that Stx17 functions in assembly of protein complexes during autophagy initiation. Stx17 is phosphorylated by TBK1 whereby phospho-Stx17 controls the formation of the ATG13+FIP200+ mammalian pre-autophagosomal structure (mPAS) in response to induction of autophagy. TBK1 phosphorylates Stx17 at S202. During autophagy induction, Stx17pS202 transfers from the Golgi, where its steady-state pools localize, to the ATG13+FIP200+ mPAS. Stx17pS202 was in complexes with ATG13 and FIP200, whereas its non-phosphorylatable mutant Stx17S202A was not. Stx17 or TBK1 knockouts blocked ATG13 and FIP200 puncta formation. Stx17 or TBK1 knockouts reduced the formation of ATG13 protein complexes with FIP200 and ULK1. Endogenous Stx17pS202 colocalized with LC3B following induction of autophagy. Stx17 knockout diminished LC3 response and reduced sequestration of the prototypical bulk autophagy cargo lactate dehydrogenase. We conclude that Stx17 is a TBK1 substrate and that together they orchestrate assembly of mPAS.

Abstract: Summary
The correct assignment of cell fate within fields of multipotent progenitors is essential for accurate tissue diversification. The first lymphatic vessels arise from pre-existing veins after venous endothelial cells become specified as lymphatic progenitors. Prox1 specifies lymphatic fate and labels these progenitors; however, the mechanisms restricting Prox1 expression and limiting the progenitor pool remain unknown. We identified a zebrafish mutant that displayed premature, expanded, and prolonged lymphatic specification. The gene responsible encodes the regulator of alternative splicing, Nova2. In zebrafish and human endothelial cells, Nova2 selectively regulates pre-mRNA splicing for components of signaling pathways and phosphoproteins. Nova2-deficient endothelial cells display increased Mapk/Erk signaling, and Prox1 expression is dynamically controlled by Erk signaling. We identify a mechanism whereby Nova2-regulated splicing constrains Erk signaling, thus limiting lymphatic progenitor cell specification. This identifies the capacity of a factor that tunes mRNA splicing to control assignment of cell fate during vascular differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
A surprising complexity of ubiquitin signaling has emerged with identification of different ubiquitin chain topologies. However, mechanisms of how the diverse ubiquitin codes control biological processes remain poorly understood. Here, we use quantitative whole-proteome mass spectrometry to identify yeast proteins that are regulated by lysine 11 (K11)-linked ubiquitin chains. The entire Met4 pathway, which links cell proliferation with sulfur amino acid metabolism, was significantly affected by K11 chains and selected for mechanistic studies. Previously, we demonstrated that a K48-linked ubiquitin chain represses the transcription factor Met4. Here, we show that efficient Met4 activation requires a K11-linked topology. Mechanistically, our results propose that the K48 chain binds to a topology-selective tandem ubiquitin binding region in Met4 and competes with binding of the basal transcription machinery to the same region. The change to K11-enriched chain architecture releases this competition and permits binding of the basal transcription complex to activate transcription.

Abstract: Summary
The NAD+-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is down-regulated in triple-negative breast cancer. To determine the mechanistic basis by which reduced SIRT1 expression influences processes related to certain aggressive cancers, we examined the consequences of depleting breast cancer cells of SIRT1. We discovered that reducing SIRT1 levels decreased the expression of one particular subunit of the vacuolar-type H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), which is responsible for proper lysosomal acidification and protein degradation. This impairment in lysosomal function caused a reduction in the number of multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs) targeted for lysosomal degradation and resulted in larger MVBs prior to their fusing with the plasma membrane to release their contents. Collectively, these findings help explain how reduced SIRT1 expression, by disrupting lysosomal function and generating a secretome comprising exosomes with unique cargo and soluble hydrolases that degrade the extracellular matrix, can promote processes that increase breast-cancer-cell survival and invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is essential for hematopoiesis, while PRMT5 inhibition remains a promising therapeutic strategy against various cancers. Here, we demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence and viability are severely perturbed upon PRMT5 depletion, which also increases HSC size, PI3K/AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activity, and protein synthesis rate. We uncover a critical role for PRMT5 in maintaining HSC genomic integrity by modulating splicing of genes involved in DNA repair. We found that reducing PRMT5 activity upregulates exon skipping and intron retention events that impair gene expression. Genes across multiple DNA repair pathways are affected, several of which mediate interstrand crosslink repair and homologous recombination. Consequently, loss of PRMT5 activity leads to endogenous DNA damage that triggers p53 activation, induces apoptosis, and culminates in rapid HSC exhaustion, which is significantly delayed by p53 depletion. Collectively, these findings establish the importance of cell-intrinsic PRMT5 activity in HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a cell survival process essential for the regulation of immune responses to infections. However, the role of T cell autophagy in anti-tumor immunity is less clear. Here, we demonstrate a cell-autonomous role for autophagy in the regulation of CD8+ T-cell-mediated control of tumors. Mice deficient for the essential autophagy genes Atg5, Atg14, or Atg16L1 display a dramatic impairment in the growth of syngeneic tumors. Moreover, T cells lacking Atg5 have a profound shift to an effector memory phenotype and produce greater amounts of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Mechanistically, Atg5−/− CD8+ T cells exhibit enhanced glucose metabolism that results in alterations in histone methylation, increases in H3K4me3 density, and transcriptional upregulation of both metabolic and effector target genes. Nonetheless, glucose restriction is sufficient to suppress Atg5-dependent increases in effector function. Thus, autophagy-dependent changes in CD8+ T cell metabolism directly regulate anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
7-methylguanosine (m7G) is present at mRNA caps and at defined internal positions within tRNAs and rRNAs. However, its detection within low-abundance mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) has been hampered by a lack of sensitive detection strategies. Here, we adapt a chemical reactivity assay to detect internal m7G in miRNAs. Using this technique (Borohydride Reduction sequencing [BoRed-seq]) alongside RNA immunoprecipitation, we identify m7G within a subset of miRNAs that inhibit cell migration. We show that the METTL1 methyltransferase mediates m7G methylation within miRNAs and that this enzyme regulates cell migration via its catalytic activity. Using refined mass spectrometry methods, we map m7G to a single guanosine within the let-7e-5p miRNA. We show that METTL1-mediated methylation augments let-7 miRNA processing by disrupting an inhibitory secondary structure within the primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA). These results identify METTL1-dependent N7-methylation of guanosine as a new RNA modification pathway that regulates miRNA structure, biogenesis, and cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Common fragile sites (CFSs) are genomic regions that display gaps and breaks in human metaphase chromosomes under replication stress and are often deleted in cancer cells. We studied an ∼300-bp subregion (Flex1) of human CFS FRA16D in yeast and found that it recapitulates characteristics of CFS fragility in human cells. Flex1 fragility is dependent on the ability of a variable-length AT repeat to form a cruciform structure that stalls replication. Fragility at Flex1 is initiated by structure-specific endonuclease Mus81-Mms4 acting together with the Slx1-4/Rad1-10 complex, whereas Yen1 protects Flex1 against breakage. Sae2 is required for healing of Flex1 after breakage. Our study shows that breakage within a CFS can be initiated by nuclease cleavage at forks stalled at DNA structures. Furthermore, our results suggest that CFSs are not just prone to breakage but also are impaired in their ability to heal, and this deleterious combination accounts for their fragility.

Abstract: Summary
Translation initiation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomic RNA is induced by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Our cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis revealed that the HCV IRES binds to the solvent side of the 40S platform of the cap-dependently translating 80S ribosome. Furthermore, we obtained the cryo-EM structures of the HCV IRES capturing the 40S subunit of the IRES-dependently translating 80S ribosome. In the elucidated structures, the HCV IRES “body,” consisting of domain III except for subdomain IIIb, binds to the 40S subunit, while the “long arm,” consisting of domain II, remains flexible and does not impede the ongoing translation. Biochemical experiments revealed that the cap-dependently translating ribosome becomes a better substrate for the HCV IRES than the free ribosome. Therefore, the HCV IRES is likely to efficiently induce the translation initiation of its downstream mRNA with the captured translating ribosome as soon as the ongoing translation terminates.

Abstract: Summary
The SWR1C chromatin remodeling enzyme catalyzes ATP-dependent replacement of nucleosomal H2A with the H2A.Z variant, regulating key DNA-mediated processes such as transcription and DNA repair. Here, we investigate the transient kinetic mechanism of the histone exchange reaction, employing ensemble FRET, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and the steady-state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis. Our studies indicate that SWR1C modulates nucleosome dynamics on both the millisecond and microsecond timescales, poising the nucleosome for the dimer exchange reaction. The transient kinetic analysis of the remodeling reaction performed under single turnover conditions unraveled a striking asymmetry in the ATP-dependent replacement of nucleosomal dimers, promoted by localized DNA unwrapping. Taken together, our transient kinetic studies identify intermediates and provide crucial insights into the SWR1C-catalyzed dimer exchange reaction and shed light on how the mechanics of H2A.Z deposition might contribute to transcriptional regulation in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The majority of individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) exhibit neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions rich in the RNA binding protein TDP43. Even so, the relation between the RNA binding properties of TDP43 and neurodegeneration remains obscure. Here, we show that engineered mutations disrupting a salt bridge between the RNA recognition motifs of TDP43 interfere with RNA binding and eliminate the recognition of native TDP43 substrates. The same mutations dramatically destabilize TDP43, alter its subcellular localization, and abrogate TDP43-dependent neurodegeneration. Worms harboring homologous TDP-1 mutations phenocopy knockout strains, confirming the necessity of salt bridge residues for TDP43 function. Moreover, the accumulation of functional TDP43, but not RNA binding-deficient variants, disproportionately affects transcripts encoding ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation components. These studies demonstrate the significance of the salt bridge in sustaining TDP43 stability and RNA binding properties, factors that are crucial for neurodegeneration arising from TDP43 deposition in ALS and FTD.

Abstract: Summary
Global changes in chromatin organization and the cessation of transcription during mitosis are thought to challenge the resumption of appropriate transcription patterns after mitosis. The acetyl-lysine binding protein BRD4 has been previously suggested to function as a transcriptional “bookmark” on mitotic chromatin. Here, genome-wide location analysis of BRD4 in erythroid cells, combined with data normalization and peak characterization approaches, reveals that BRD4 widely occupies mitotic chromatin. However, removal of BRD4 from mitotic chromatin does not impair post-mitotic activation of transcription. Additionally, histone mass spectrometry reveals global preservation of most posttranslational modifications (PTMs) during mitosis. In particular, H3K14ac, H3K27ac, H3K122ac, and H4K16ac widely mark mitotic chromatin, especially at lineage-specific genes, and predict BRD4 mitotic binding genome wide. Therefore, BRD4 is likely not a mitotic bookmark but only a “passenger.” Instead, mitotic histone acetylation patterns may constitute the actual bookmarks that restore lineage-specific transcription patterns after mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons in Drosophila ovaries, ensuring female fertility. Two coupled pathways generate germline piRNAs: the ping-pong cycle, in which the PIWI proteins Aubergine and Ago3 increase the abundance of pre-existing piRNAs, and the phased piRNA pathway, which generates strings of tail-to-head piRNAs, one after another. Proteins acting in the ping-pong cycle localize to nuage, whereas phased piRNA production requires Zucchini, an endonuclease on the mitochondrial surface. Here, we report that Armitage (Armi), an RNA-binding ATPase localized to both nuage and mitochondria, links the ping-pong cycle to the phased piRNA pathway. Mutations that block phased piRNA production deplete Armi from nuage. Armi ATPase mutants cannot support phased piRNA production and inappropriately bind mRNA instead of piRNA precursors. We propose that Armi shuttles between nuage and mitochondria, feeding precursor piRNAs generated by Ago3 cleavage into the Zucchini-dependent production of Aubergine- and Piwi-bound piRNAs on the mitochondrial surface.

Astrocytic differentiation is developmentally impaired in patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia (SCZ). To determine why, we used genetic gain- and loss-of-function studies to establish the contributions of differentially expressed transcriptional regulators to the defective differentiation of glial progenitor cells (GPCs) produced from SCZ patient-derived induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs). Negative regulators of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway were upregulated in SCZ GPCs, including BAMBI, FST, and GREM1, whose overexpression retained SCZ GPCs at the progenitor stage. SMAD4 knockdown (KD) suppressed the production of these BMP inhibitors by SCZ GPCs and rescued normal astrocytic differentiation. In addition, the BMP-regulated transcriptional repressor REST was upregulated in SCZ GPCs, and its KD similarly restored normal glial differentiation. REST KD also rescued potassium-transport-associated gene expression and K+ uptake, which were otherwise deficient in SCZ glia. These data suggest that the glial differentiation defect in childhood-onset SCZ, and its attendant disruption in K+ homeostasis, may be rescued by targeting BMP/SMAD4- and REST-dependent transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium signals act as universal second messengers that trigger many cellular processes in animals and plants, but how specific calcium signals are generated is not well understood. In this study, we determined that AtANN4, a putative calcium-permeable transporter, and its interacting proteins, SCaBP8 and SOS2, generate a calcium signal under salt stress, which initially activates the SOS pathway, a conserved mechanism that modulates ion homeostasis in plants under salt stress. After activation, SCaBP8 promotes the interaction of protein kinase SOS2 with AtANN4, which enhances its phosphorylation by SOS2. This phosphorylation of AtANN4 further increases its interaction with SCaBP8. Both the interaction with and phosphorylation of AtANN4 repress its activity and alter calcium transients and signatures in HEK cells and plants. Our results reveal how downstream targets are required to create a specific calcium signal via a negative feedback regulatory loop, thereby enhancing our understanding of the regulation of calcium signaling.

Abstract: The amniotic membrane can be considered as one of the sources of isolation of these cells, since it is found in the fetal maternal interface and has low immunogenicity. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have not been identified in canine amniotic membrane (AMC). Therefore, our objective was to isolate, culture, characterize and differentiate cells derived from canine amniotic membrane (AMC) and to verify its immunological and tumorigenic potential. For this, 12 dogs fetuses of each gestational age 32, 43 and 55 days were used, and the isolation and culture of the AMC were performed. We observed that the cells presented fibroblastoid morphology and high confluence even after freezing. We also observed that, when induced, they were able to differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic cells, as well as being CD34- and CD105+. Regarding the immunological markers, we found that IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and MHC II were not expressed, whereas MHC I was expressed. After application of AMC cells in nude mice we can verify that there was no tumor formation. Based on this, we conclude that canine amniotic membrane is a good and accessible source for obtaining MSCs of low immunogenic and tumorigenic potential for veterinary therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Summary
The diversity of mRNA lifetimes in bacterial cells is difficult to reconcile with the relaxed cleavage site specificity of RNase E, the endonuclease most important for governing mRNA degradation. This enzyme has generally been thought to locate cleavage sites by searching freely in three dimensions. However, our results now show that its access to such sites in 5′-monophosphorylated RNA is hindered by obstacles—such as bound proteins or ribosomes or coaxial small RNA (sRNA) base pairing—that disrupt the path from the 5′ end to those sites and prolong mRNA lifetimes. These findings suggest that RNase E searches for cleavage sites by scanning linearly from the 5′-terminal monophosphate along single-stranded regions of RNA and that its progress is impeded by structural discontinuities encountered along the way. This discovery has major implications for gene regulation in bacteria and suggests a general mechanism by which other prokaryotic and eukaryotic regulatory proteins can be controlled.

Abstract: The roles of the thicknesses and grafting densities of the surface biopolymers of four multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli bacterial strains that varied in their biofilm formation in controlling cellular elasticities after exposure to ampicillin were investigated using atomic force microscopy. Exposure to ampicillin was carried out at minimum inhibitory concentrations for different duration times. Our results indicated that the four strains resisted ampicillin through variable mechanisms. Strain A5 did not change its cellular properties upon exposure to ampicillin and as such resisted ampicillin through dormancy. Strain H5 increased its biopolymer brush thickness, adhesion and biofilm formation and kept its roughness, surface area and cell elasticity unchanged upon exposure to ampicillin. As such, this strain likely limits the diffusion of ampicillin by forming strong biofilms. At three hours’ exposure to ampicillin, strains D4 and A9 increased their roughness, surface areas, biofilm formation, and brush thicknesses and decreased their elasticities. Therefore, at short exposure times to ampicillin, these strains resisted ampicillin through forming strong biofilms that impede ampicillin diffusion. At eight hours’ exposure to ampicillin, strains D4 and A9 collapsed their biopolymers, increased their apparent grafting densities and increased their cellular elasticities. Therefore, at long exposure times to ampicillin, cells utilized their higher rigidity to reduce the diffusion of ampicillin into the cells. The findings of this study clearly point to the potential of using the nanoscale characterization of MDR bacterial properties as a means to monitor cell modifications that enhance “phenotypic antibiotic resistance”.

Abstract: Summary
The brain processes information and generates cognitive and motor outputs through functions of spatially organized proteins in different types of neurons. More complete knowledge of proteins and their distributions within neuronal compartments in intact circuits would help in the understanding of brain function. We used unbiased in vivo protein labeling with intravitreal NHS-biotin for discovery and analysis of endogenous axonally transported proteins in the visual system using tandem mass spectrometric proteomics, biochemistry, and both light and electron microscopy. Purification and proteomic analysis of biotinylated peptides identified ∼1,000 proteins transported from retinal ganglion cells into the optic nerve and ∼575 biotinylated proteins recovered from presynaptic compartments of lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus. Approximately 360 biotinylated proteins were differentially detected in the two retinal targets. This study characterizes axonally transported proteins in the healthy adult visual system by analyzing proteomes from multiple compartments of retinal ganglion cell projections in the intact brain.

Abstract: Expression of the zinc receptor, ZnR/GPR39, is increased in higher grade breast cancer tumors and cells. Zinc, its ligand, is accumulated at larger concentrations in the tumor tissue and can therefore activate ZnR/GPR39-dependent Ca2+ signaling leading to tumor progression. The K+/Cl− co-transporters (KCC), activated by intracellular signaling, enhance breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We asked if ZnR/GPR39 enhances breast cancer cell malignancy by activating KCC. Activation of ZnR/GPR39 by Zn2+ upregulated K+/Cl− co-transport activity, measured using NH4+ as a surrogate to K+ while monitoring intracellular pH. Upregulation of NH4+ transport was monitored in tamoxifen resistant cells with functional ZnR/GPR39-dependent Ca2+ signaling but not in MCF-7 cells lacking this response. The NH4+ transport was Na+-independent, and we therefore focused on KCC family members. Silencing of KCC3, but not KCC4, expression abolished Zn2+-dependent K+/Cl− co-transport, suggesting that KCC3 is mediating upregulated NH4+ transport. The ZnR/GPR39-dependent KCC3 activation accelerated scratch closure rate, which was abolished by inhibiting KCC transport with [(DihydroIndenyl) Oxy] Alkanoic acid (DIOA). Importantly, silencing of either ZnR/GPR39 or KCC3 attenuated Zn2+-dependent scratch closure. Thus, a novel link between KCC3 and Zn2+, via ZnR/GPR39, promotes breast cancer cell migration and proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a promising melanocyte source as they propagate indefinitely and can be established from patients. However, the in vivo functions of human iPSC-derived melanocytes (hiMels) remain unknown. Here, we generated hiMels from vitiligo patients using a three-dimensional system with enhanced differentiation efficiency, which showed characteristics of human epidermal melanocytes with high sequence similarity and involved in multiple vitiligo-associated signaling pathways. A modified hair follicle reconstitution assay in vivo showed that MITF+PAX3+TYRP1+ hiMels were localized in the mouse hair bulb and epidermis and produced melanin up to 7 weeks after transplantation, whereas MITF+PAX3+TYRP1− hiMelanocyte stem cells integrated into the bulge-subbulge regions. Overall, these data demonstrate the long-term functions of hiMels in vivo to reconstitute pigmented hair follicles and to integrate into normal regions for both mature melanocytes and melanocyte stem cells, providing an alternative source of personalized cellular therapy for depigmentation.

Abstract: Summary
Protein transport into the nucleus is mediated by transport receptors. Import of highly charged proteins, such as histone H1 and ribosomal proteins, requires a dimer of two transport receptors. In this study, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the Imp7:Impβ:H1.0 complex, showing that the two importins form a cradle that accommodates the linker histone. The H1.0 globular domain is bound to Impβ, whereas the acidic loops of Impβ and Imp7 chaperone the positively charged C-terminal tail. Although it remains disordered, the H1 tail serves as a zipper that closes and stabilizes the structure through transient non-specific interactions with importins. Moreover, we found that the GGxxF and FxFG motifs in the Imp7 C-terminal tail are essential for Imp7:Impβ dimerization and H1 import, resembling importin interaction with nucleoporins, which, in turn, promote complex disassembly. The architecture of many other complexes might be similarly defined by rapidly exchanging electrostatic interactions mediated by disordered regions.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic low-grade inflammation and increased serum levels of the cytokine IL-6 accompany obesity. For brain-produced IL-6, the mechanisms by which it controls energy balance and its role in obesity remain unclear. Here, we show that brain-produced IL-6 is decreased in obese mice and rats in a neuroanatomically and sex-specific manner. Reduced IL-6 mRNA localized to lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN) astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, including paraventricular hypothalamus-innervating lPBN neurons. IL-6 microinjection into lPBN reduced food intake and increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis in male lean and obese rats by increasing thyroid and sympathetic outflow to BAT. Parabrachial IL-6 interacted with leptin to reduce feeding. siRNA-mediated reduction of lPBN IL-6 leads to increased weight gain and adiposity, reduced BAT thermogenesis, and increased food intake. Ambient cold exposure partly normalizes the obesity-induced suppression of lPBN IL-6. These results indicate that lPBN-produced IL-6 regulates feeding and metabolism and pinpoints (patho)physiological contexts interacting with lPBN IL-6.

Abstract: Summary
Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has previously been shown to exert antiviral activity against influenza A virus by inhibiting nucleoprotein (NP) binding to RNA. Here, we show that naproxen is a potential broad, multi-mechanistic anti-influenza virus therapeutic, as it inhibits influenza B virus replication both in vivo and in vitro. The anti-influenza B virus activity of naproxen is more efficient than that of the commonly used neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir in mice. Furthermore, the NP of influenza B virus (BNP) has a higher binding affinity to naproxen than influenza A virus NP (ANP). Specifically, naproxen targets the NP at residues F209 (BNP) and Y148 (ANP). This interaction antagonizes the nuclear export of NP normally mediated by the host export protein CRM1. This study reveals a crucial mechanism of broad-spectrum anti-influenza virus activity of naproxen, suggesting that the existing drug naproxen may be used as an anti-influenza drug.

Abstract: Summary
Choline is a vitamin-like nutrient that is taken up via specific transporters and metabolized by choline kinase, which converts it to phosphocholine needed for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the main phospholipid of cellular membranes. We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation enhances choline uptake by macrophages and microglia through induction of the choline transporter CTL1. Inhibition of CTL1 expression or choline phosphorylation attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β and IL-18 production in stimulated macrophages. Mechanistically, reduced choline uptake altered mitochondrial lipid profile, attenuated mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and activated the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). By potentiating mitochondrial recruitment of DRP1, AMPK stimulates mitophagy, which contributes to termination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Correspondingly, choline kinase inhibitors ameliorated acute and chronic models of IL-1β-dependent inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically resistant to drugs because of their double-membrane envelope structure that acts as a permeability barrier and as an anchor for efflux pumps. Antibiotics are blocked and expelled from cells and cannot reach high-enough intracellular concentrations to exert a therapeutic effect. Efforts to target one membrane protein at a time have been ineffective. Here, we show that m1G37-tRNA methylation determines the synthesis of a multitude of membrane proteins via its control of translation at proline codons near the start of open reading frames. Decreases in m1G37 levels in Escherichia coli and Salmonella impair membrane structure and sensitize these bacteria to multiple classes of antibiotics, rendering them incapable of developing resistance or persistence. Codon engineering of membrane-associated genes reduces their translational dependence on m1G37 and confers resistance. These findings highlight the potential of tRNA methylation in codon-specific translation to control the development of multi-drug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative pre-mRNA-splicing-induced post-transcriptional gene expression regulation is one of the pathways for tumors maintaining proliferation rates accompanying the malignant phenotype under stress. Here, we uncover a list of hyperacetylated proteins in the context of acutely reduced Acetyl-CoA levels under nutrient starvation. PHF5A, a component of U2 snRNPs, can be acetylated at lysine 29 in response to multiple cellular stresses, which is dependent on p300. PHF5A acetylation strengthens the interaction among U2 snRNPs and affects global pre-mRNA splicing pattern and extensive gene expression. PHF5A hyperacetylation-induced alternative splicing stabilizes KDM3A mRNA and promotes its protein expression. Pathologically, PHF5A K29 hyperacetylation and KDM3A upregulation axis are correlated with poor prognosis of colon cancer. Our findings uncover a mechanism of an anti-stress pathway through which acetylation on PHF5A promotes the cancer cells’ capacity for stress resistance and consequently contributes to colon carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian glycocalyx is a heavily glycosylated extramembrane compartment found on nearly every cell. Despite its relevance in both health and disease, studies of the glycocalyx remain hampered by a paucity of methods to spatially classify its components. We combine metabolic labeling, bioorthogonal chemistry, and super-resolution localization microscopy to image two constituents of cell-surface glycans, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and sialic acid, with 10–20 nm precision in 2D and 3D. This approach enables two measurements: glycocalyx height and the distribution of individual sugars distal from the membrane. These measurements show that the glycocalyx exhibits nanoscale organization on both cell lines and primary human tumor cells. Additionally, we observe enhanced glycocalyx height in response to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and to oncogenic KRAS activation. In the latter case, we trace increased height to an effector gene, GALNT7. These data highlight the power of advanced imaging methods to provide molecular and functional insights into glycocalyx biology.

Abstract: Astragalin is a flavonol glycoside with several biological activities, including antidiabetic properties. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of astragalin on glycaemia and insulin secretion, in vivo, and on calcium influx and insulin secretion in isolated rat pancreatic islets, ex vivo. Astragalin (1 and 10 mg / kg) was administered by oral gavage to fasted Wistar rats and serum glucose and plasma insulin were measured. Isolated pancreatic islets were used to measure basal insulin secretion and calcium influx. Astragalin (10 mg/ kg) decreased glycaemia and increased insulin secretion significantly at 15–180 min, respectively, in the glucose tolerance test. In isolated pancreatic cells, astragalin (100 μM) stimulated calcium influx through a mechanism involving ATP-dependent potassium channels, L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase (SERCA), PKC and PKA. These findings highlight the dietary coadjuvant, astragalin, as a potential insulin secretagogue that may contribute to glucose homeostasis.

Abstract: RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) is a major florigen that functions to induce reproductive development in the shoot apical meristem (SAM). To further our study of RFT1, we overexpressed the gene and examined the expression patterns of major regulatory genes during floral transition and inflorescence development. Overexpression induced extremely early flowering in the transgenics, and a majority of those calli directly formed spikelets with a few spikelets, thus bypassing normal vegetative development. FRUITFULL (FUL)-clade genes OsMADS14, OsMADS15, and OsMADS18 were highly induced in the RFT1-expressing meristems. OsMADS34 was also induced in the meristems. This indicated that RFT1 promotes the expression of major regulatory genes that are important for inflorescence development. RFT1 overexpression also induced SEPALLATA (SEP)-clade genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, and OsMADS7 in the greening calli before floral transition occurred. This suggested their possible roles at the early reproductive stages. We found it interesting that expression of OsFD1 as well as OsFD2 and OsFD3 was strongly increased in the RFT1-expressing calli and spikelets. At a low frequency, those calli produced plants with a few leaves that generated a panicle with a small number of spikelets. In the transgenic leaves, the FUL-clade genes and OsMADS34 were induced, but SEP-clade gene expression was not increased.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple layers of regulation modulate the activity and localization of protein kinases. However, many details of kinase regulation remain incompletely understood. Here, we apply saturation mutagenesis and a chemical genetic method for allosterically modulating kinase global conformation to Src kinase, providing insight into known regulatory mechanisms and revealing a previously undiscovered interaction between Src’s SH4 and catalytic domains. Abrogation of this interaction increased phosphotransferase activity, promoted membrane association, and provoked phosphotransferase-independent alterations in cell morphology. Thus, Src’s SH4 domain serves as an intramolecular regulator coupling catalytic activity, global conformation, and localization, as well as mediating a phosphotransferase-independent function. Sequence conservation suggests that the SH4 domain regulatory interaction exists in other Src-family kinases. Our combined approach’s ability to reveal a regulatory mechanism in one of the best-studied kinases suggests that it could be applied broadly to provide insight into kinase structure, regulation, and function.

Abstract: Summary
Locomotion relies on the activity of basal ganglia networks, where, as the output, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) integrates incoming signals and relays them to downstream areas. The cellular and circuit substrates of such a complex function remain unclear. We hypothesized that the SNr controls different aspects of locomotion through coordinated cell-type-specific sub-circuits. Using anatomical mapping, single-cell qPCR, and electrophysiological techniques, we identified two SNr sub-populations: the centromedial-thalamo projectors (CMps) and the SN compacta projectors (SNcps), which are genetically targeted based on vesicular transporter for gamma-aminobutyric acid (VGAT) or parvalbumin (PV) expression, respectively. Optogenetic manipulation of these two sub-types across a series of motor tests provided evidence that they govern different aspects of motor behavior. While CMp activity supports the continuity of motor patterns, SNcp modulates the immediate motor drive behind them. Collectively, our data suggest that at least two different sub-circuits arise from the SNr, engage different behavioral motor components, and collaborate to produce correct locomotion.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the histopathological and ultrastructural changes in sciatic nerve barriers after exposure to different doses of nicotine. Twenty-seven adult male rats were divided into 2 groups; group I served as control (n = 9) and group II that received nicotine (n = 18) was subdivided into two equal subgroups; group IIa and group IIb that were injected subcutaneously daily for one month with nicotine at a dose of 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg body weight, respectively. Specimens of sciatic nerve were processed for light and electron microscopy. Immunohistochemical expression of ZO-1 and vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) were investigated. Abundance of mRNA for VEGF was determined via qRT-PCR. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were measured. Group IIb showed increased perineural fibrosis and myelin abnormalities. ZO-1 expression was significantly decreased. Schwann cells showed features of apoptosis and blood capillaries showed disrupted lining. High statistical difference in the level of mRNA expression of VEGF between group IIb and group I was found. There was decreased level of TAC and increased MDA, ALT and AST. A dose-dependent nicotine-induced oxidative stress on the sciatic nerve occurred via disruption of nerve barriers, altered VEGF and ZO-1 levels.

Abstract: Summary
Vaccinia virus (VACV) has numerous immune evasion strategies, including multiple mechanisms of inhibition of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Here, we use highly multiplexed proteomics to quantify ∼9,000 cellular proteins and ∼80% of viral proteins at seven time points throughout VACV infection. A total of 265 cellular proteins are downregulated >2-fold by VACV, including putative natural killer cell ligands and IFN-stimulated genes. Two-thirds of these viral targets, including class II histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), are degraded proteolytically during infection. In follow-up analysis, we demonstrate that HDAC5 restricts replication of both VACV and herpes simplex virus type 1. By generating a protein-based temporal classification of VACV gene expression, we identify protein C6, a multifunctional IFN antagonist, as being necessary and sufficient for proteasomal degradation of HDAC5. Our approach thus identifies both a host antiviral factor and a viral mechanism of innate immune evasion.

Abstract: Summary
The type III-A Csm complex of Streptococcus thermophilus (StCsm) provides immunity against invading nucleic acids through the coordinated action of three catalytic domains: RNase (Csm3), ssDNase (Cas10-HD), and cyclic oligoadenylates synthase (Cas10-Palm). The matured StCsm complex is composed of Cas10:Csm2:Csm3:Csm4:Csm5 subunits and 40-nt CRISPR RNA (crRNA). We have carried out gene disruptions for each subunit and isolated deletion complexes to reveal the role of individual subunits in complex assembly and function. We show that the Cas10-Csm4 subcomplex binds the 5′-handle of crRNA and triggers Csm3 oligomerization to form a padlock for crRNA binding. We demonstrate that Csm5 plays a key role in target RNA binding while Csm2 ensures RNA cleavage at multiple sites by Csm3. Finally, guided by deletion analysis, we engineered a minimal Csm complex containing only the Csm3, Csm4, and Cas10 subunits and crRNA and demonstrated that it retains all three catalytic activities, thus paving the way for practical applications.

Abstract: The entorhinal cortex plays an important role in temporal lobe processes including learning and memory, object recognition, and contextual information processing. The alteration of the strength of synaptic inputs to the lateral entorhinal cortex may therefore contribute substantially to sensory and mnemonic functions. The neuromodulatory transmitter dopamine exerts powerful effects on excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex. Interestingly, inputs from midbrain dopamine neurons appear to specifically target clusters of excitatory cells located in the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex. We have previously demonstrated that dopamine facilitates synaptic transmission through the activation of D1-like receptors. This facilitation of synaptic transmission is dependent on both activation of classical D1-like-receptors, and upon activation of dopamine receptors linked to increases in phospholipase C, inositol triphosphate (IP3), and intracellular calcium. In the present study we combined electrophysiological recordings of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents with imaging of intracellular calcium using the fluorescent indicator fluo-4 to monitor calcium transients evoked by dopamine in electrophysiologically identified putative fan and pyramidal cells of the lateral entorhinal cortex. Bath application of dopamine (1 μM), or the phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked D1-like-receptor agonist SKF83959 (5 μM), induced reliable and reversible increases in fluo-4 fluorescence and excitatory postsynaptic currents in fan cells, but not in pyramidal cells. In contrast, application of the classical D1-like-receptor agonist SKF38393 (10 μM) did not result in significant increases in fluorescence. Blocking release of calcium from internal stores by loading cells with the IP3 receptor blocker heparin (1 mM) or the ryanodine receptor blocker dantrolene (20 μM) abolished both the calcium transients and the facilitation of evoked synaptic currents induced by dopamine. Dopamine also induced calcium transients in fan cells when calcium was excluded from the extracellular medium, further indicating that the calcium transients are linked to release from internal stores. These results indicate that following D1-like-receptor binding, dopamine selectively induces transient elevations in intracellular calcium via activation of IP3 and ryanodine receptors, and that these elevations are linked to the facilitation of synaptic responses in putative layer II entorhinal cortex fan cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cotranslational protein folding requires assistance from elaborate ribosome-associated chaperone networks. It remains unclear how the changing information in a growing nascent polypeptide dictates the recruitment of functionally distinct chaperones. Here, we used ribosome profiling to define the principles governing the cotranslational action of the chaperones TRiC/CCT and Hsp70/Ssb. We show that these chaperones are sequentially recruited to specific sites within domain-encoding regions of select nascent polypeptides. Hsp70 associates first, binding select sites throughout domains, whereas TRiC associates later, upon the emergence of nearly complete domains that expose an unprotected hydrophobic surface. This suggests that transient topological properties of nascent folding intermediates drive sequential chaperone association. Moreover, cotranslational recruitment of both TRiC and Hsp70 correlated with translation elongation slowdowns. We propose that the temporal modulation of the nascent chain structural landscape is coordinated with local elongation rates to regulate the hierarchical action of Hsp70 and TRiC for cotranslational folding.

Abstract: Over-dependence on existing synthetic scaffolds and insufficient vascularization limit the development of tissue engineered bone (TEB). The purpose of this study is to fabricate vascularized and scaffold-free bone tissue using cell sheet technology and to assess its feasibility to repair critical-sized calvarial defects in rats. Firstly, the pre-vascularized cell sheet was formed by seeding BMSC-derived endothelial cells (ECs) on an undifferentiated BMSCs cell sheet layer in vitro. After 3 days of co-culture, ECs migrated and rearranged to form lumens on the BMSC sheet. Secondly, osteogenic cell sheet was formed by inducing osteogenic differentiation of high density BMSCs. Then, the pre-vascularized cell sheet was stacked on BMSC-derived osteogenic cell sheet to fabricate a scaffold-free construct for bone regeneration. Finally, the scaffold-free construct with both angiogenic and osteogenic potential was implanted into critical-sized calvarial defects in adult Wistar rats. Results showed that more functional perfused blood vessels and new bone tissue formed in the pre-vascularized group than that in the controls (both empty and non-pre-vascularized cell sheet group). This study indicates a new promising strategy for bone tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) targeting CRISPR-Cas9 systems represent natural “off switches” for Cas9-based applications. Recently, AcrIIC1, AcrIIC2, and AcrIIC3 proteins were found to inhibit Neisseria meningitidis Cas9 (NmeCas9) activity in bacterial and human cells. Here we report biochemical and structural data that suggest molecular mechanisms of AcrIIC2- and AcrIIC3-mediated Cas9 inhibition. AcrIIC2 dimer interacts with the bridge helix of Cas9, interferes with RNA binding, and prevents DNA loading into Cas9. AcrIIC3 blocks the DNA loading step through binding to a non-conserved surface of the HNH domain of Cas9. AcrIIC3 also forms additional interactions with the REC lobe of Cas9 and induces the dimerization of the AcrIIC3-Cas9 complex. While AcrIIC2 targets Cas9 orthologs from different subtypes, albeit with different efficiency, AcrIIC3 specifically inhibits NmeCas9. Structure-guided changes in NmeCas9 orthologs convert them into anti-CRISPR-sensitive proteins. Our studies provide insights into anti-CRISPR-mediated suppression mechanisms and guidelines for designing regulatory tools in Cas9-based applications.

Abstract: Summary
Aging strongly influences human morbidity and mortality. Thus, aging-preventive compounds could greatly improve our health and lifespan. Here we screened for such compounds, known as geroprotectors, employing the power of transcriptomics to predict biological age. Using age-stratified human tissue transcriptomes and machine learning, we generated age classifiers and applied these to transcriptomic changes induced by 1,309 different compounds in human cells, ranking these compounds by their ability to induce a “youthful” transcriptional state. Testing the top candidates in C. elegans, we identified two Hsp90 inhibitors, monorden and tanespimycin, which extended the animals’ lifespan and improved their health. Hsp90 inhibition induces expression of heat shock proteins known to improve protein homeostasis. Consistently, monorden treatment improved the survival of C. elegans under proteotoxic stress, and its benefits depended on the cytosolic unfolded protein response-inducing transcription factor HSF-1. Taken together, our method represents an innovative geroprotector screening approach and was able to identify a class that acts by improving protein homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cells may adapt to metabolic challenges by alternating between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). To target this metabolic plasticity, we combined intermittent fasting, a clinically feasible approach to reduce glucose availability, with the OXPHOS inhibitor metformin. In mice exposed to 24-h feeding/fasting cycles, metformin impaired tumor growth only when administered during fasting-induced hypoglycemia. Synergistic anti-neoplastic effects of the metformin/hypoglycemia combination were mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activation downstream of PP2A, leading to a decline in the pro-survival protein MCL-1, and cell death. Mechanistically, specific activation of the PP2A-GSK3β axis was the sum of metformin-induced inhibition of CIP2A, a PP2A suppressor, and of upregulation of the PP2A regulatory subunit B56δ by low glucose, leading to an active PP2A-B56δ complex with high affinity toward GSK3β.

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarity is facilitated by a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton at the cell cortex. The program triggering the asymmetric remodeling of contractile actomyosin networks remains poorly understood. Here, we show that polarization of Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes is established through sequential downregulation of cortical actomyosin networks by the mitotic kinase, Aurora-A. Aurora-A accumulates around centrosomes to locally disrupt the actomyosin contractile activity at the proximal cortex, thereby promoting cortical flows during symmetry breaking. Aurora-A later mediates global disassembly of cortical actomyosin networks, which facilitates the initial polarization through suppression of centrosome-independent cortical flows. Translocation of Aurora-A from the cytoplasm to the cortex is sufficient to interfere with the cortical actomyosin networks independently of its roles in centrosome maturation and cell-cycle progression. We propose that Aurora-A activity serves as a centrosome-mediated cue that breaks symmetry in actomyosin contractile activity, and facilitates the initial polarization through global suppression of cortical actomyosin networks.

Abstract: Summary
The construction of complex gene-regulatory networks requires both inhibitory and upregulatory modules. However, the vast majority of RNA-based regulatory “parts” are inhibitory. Using a synthetic biology approach combined with SHAPE-seq, we explored the regulatory effect of RNA-binding protein (RBP)-RNA interactions in bacterial 5′ UTRs. By positioning a library of RNA hairpins upstream of a reporter gene and co-expressing them with the matching RBP, we observed a set of regulatory responses, including translational stimulation, translational repression, and cooperative behavior. Our combined approach revealed three distinct states in vivo: in the absence of RBPs, the RNA molecules can be found in either a molten state that is amenable to translation or a structured phase that inhibits translation. In the presence of RBPs, the RNA molecules are in a semi-structured phase with partial translational capacity. Our work provides new insight into RBP-based regulation and a blueprint for designing complete gene-regulatory circuits at the post-transcriptional level.

Abstract: Summary
The delivery of mechanical power, a crucial component of animal motion, is constrained by the universal compromise between the force and the velocity of its constituent molecular systems. While the mechanisms of force generation have been studied at the single molecular motor level, there is little understanding of the magnitude of power that can be generated by folding proteins. Here, we use single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques to measure the force-velocity relation of folding titin domains that contain single internal disulfide bonds, a common feature throughout the titin I-band. We find that formation of the disulfide regulates the peak power output of protein folding in an all-or-none manner, providing at 6.0 pN, for example, a boost from 0 to 6,000 zW upon oxidation. This mechanism of power generation from protein folding is of great importance for muscle, where titin domains may unfold and refold with each extension and contraction of the sarcomere.

Abstract: Summary
Telomerase replicates chromosome ends in germ and somatic stem cells to facilitate their continued proliferation. Telomerase action depends on the telomeric protein TPP1, which recruits telomerase to telomeres and facilitates processive DNA synthesis. Here, we identify separation-of-function long (TPP1-L) and short (TPP1-S) isoforms of TPP1 that appear to be generated from separate transcripts and differ only in 86 amino acids at their N terminus. Although both isoforms retain the ability to recruit telomerase, only TPP1-S facilitates efficient telomere synthesis. We find that TPP1-S is the predominant isoform in somatic cells, and strikingly, TPP1-L is the major isoform in differentiated male germ cells. We observed that TERT expression persists in these germ cells, suggesting that TPP1-L could restrain telomerase in this context. We show how differential expression of TPP1 isoforms determines telomerase function and demonstrate how alternative transcription start sites allow one gene to perform distinct functions in different biological contexts.

Abstract: Surface modification is an important step in making a synthetic polymer cytocompatible. We have previously reported improved cytocompatibility of immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) with the otherwise bioinert fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) upon treatment with argon plasma discharge. In this article, we show that FEP modified with Ar plasma with the power of 3 and 8 W for 40 and 240 s served as a suitable material for cultivation of primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), which showed significantly improved proliferation and spreading comparable to standard tissue culture polystyrene. We also evaluated focal adhesions formed by HDF cells on modified FEP, which were far more numerous compared to pristine FEP. Moreover, we attempted spontaneous osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells modified with human telomerase reverse transcriptase on Ar plasma-modified FEP. While the spontaneous osteogenic differentiation was unsuccessful, the cells were able to adhere and differentiated on tested matrices upon the administration of osteodifferentiation medium. These combined findings suggest that the treatment of FEP with Ar plasma comprises and efficient method to enable the adhesion and proliferation of various cell types on an otherwise largely bioinert material.

Abstract: Summary
As circulating lipid levels are balanced by the rate of lipoprotein release and clearance from the plasma, lipid absorption in the small intestine critically contributes to the maintenance of whole-body lipid homeostasis. Within enterocytes, excessive triglycerides are transiently stored as cytosolic lipid droplets (cLDs), and their mobilization sustains lipid supply during interprandial periods. Using mice lacking adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and its coactivator comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) exclusively in the intestine (intestine-specific double KO [iDKO]), we show that ATGL/CGI-58 are not involved in providing substrates for chylomicron synthesis. Massive intestinal cLD accumulation in iDKO mice independent of dietary lipids together with inefficient lipid incorporation into cLDs in the early absorption phase demonstrate the existence of a secretion/re-uptake cycle, corroborating the availability of two diverse cLD pools. This study identified ATGL/CGI-58 as critical players in the catabolism of basolaterally (blood) derived lipids and highlights the necessity to modify the current model of intestinal lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Diet-induced obesity can be caused by impaired thermogenesis of beige adipocytes, the brown-like adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT). Promoting brown-like features in WAT has been an attractive therapeutic approach for obesity. However, the mechanism underlying beige adipocyte formation is largely unknown. N-α-acetyltransferase 10 protein (Naa10p) catalyzes N-α-acetylation of nascent proteins, and overexpression of human Naa10p is linked to cancer development. Here, we report that both conventional and adipose-specific Naa10p deletions in mice result in increased energy expenditure, thermogenesis, and beige adipocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, Naa10p acetylates the N terminus of Pgc1α, which prevents Pgc1α from interacting with Pparγ to activate key genes, such as Ucp1, involved in beige adipocyte function. Consistently, fat tissues of obese human individuals show higher NAA10 expression. Thus, Naa10p-mediated N-terminal acetylation of Pgc1α downregulates thermogenic gene expression, making inhibition of Naa10p enzymatic activity a potential strategy for treating obesity.

Abstract: Summary
The correct localization of Hedgehog effectors to the tip of primary cilia is critical for proper signal transduction. The conserved non-motile kinesin Kif7 defines a “cilium-tip compartment” by localizing to the distal ends of axonemal microtubules. How Kif7 recognizes microtubule ends remains unknown. We find that Kif7 preferentially binds GTP-tubulin at microtubule ends over GDP-tubulin in the mature microtubule lattice, and ATP hydrolysis by Kif7 enhances this discrimination. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures suggest that a rotated microtubule footprint and conformational changes in the ATP-binding pocket underlie Kif7’s atypical microtubule-binding properties. Finally, Kif7 not only recognizes but also stabilizes a GTP-form of tubulin to promote its own microtubule-end localization. Thus, unlike the characteristic microtubule-regulated ATPase activity of kinesins, Kif7 modulates the tubulin mechanochemical cycle. We propose that the ubiquitous kinesin fold has been repurposed in Kif7 to facilitate organization of a spatially restricted platform for localization of Hedgehog effectors at the cilium tip.

Abstract: Summary
The comprehensive but specific identification of RNA-binding proteins as well as the discovery of RNA-associated protein functions remain major challenges in RNA biology. Here we adapt the concept of RNA dependence, defining a protein as RNA dependent when its interactome depends on RNA. We converted this concept into a proteome-wide, unbiased, and enrichment-free screen called R-DeeP (RNA-dependent proteins), based on density gradient ultracentrifugation. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified 1,784 RNA-dependent proteins, including 537 lacking known links to RNA. Exploiting the quantitative nature of R-DeeP, proteins were classified as not, partially, or completely RNA dependent. R-DeeP identified the transcription factor CTCF as completely RNA dependent, and we uncovered that RNA is required for the CTCF-chromatin association. Additionally, R-DeeP allows reconstruction of protein complexes based on co-segregation. The whole dataset is available at http://R-DeeP.dkfz.de, providing proteome-wide, specific, and quantitative identification of proteins with RNA-dependent interactions and aiming at future functional discovery of RNA-protein complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) coordinate hundreds of molecular events during the cell cycle. Multiple cyclins are involved, but the global role of cyclin-specific phosphorylation has remained unsolved. We uncovered a cyclin docking motif, LxF, that mediates binding of replication factor Cdc6 to mitotic cyclin. This interaction leads to phospho-adaptor Cks1-mediated inhibition of M-CDK to facilitate Cdc6 accumulation and sequestration in mitosis. The LxF motif and Cks1 also mediate the mutual inhibition between M-CDK and the tyrosine kinase Swe1. Additionally, the LxF motif is critical for targeting M-CDK to phosphorylate several mitotic regulators; for example, Spo12 is targeted via LxF to release the phosphatase Cdc14. The results complete the full set of G1, S, and M-CDK docking mechanisms and outline the unified role of cyclin specificity and CDK activity thresholds. Cooperation of cyclin and Cks1 docking creates a variety of CDK thresholds and switching orders, including combinations of last in, first out (LIFO) and first in, first out (FIFO) ordering.

Abstract: Summary
In neurons, defects in autophagosome clearance have been associated with neurodegenerative disease. Yet, the mechanisms that coordinate trafficking and clearance of synaptic autophagosomes are poorly understood. Here, we use genetic screens and in vivo imaging in single neurons of C. elegans to identify mechanisms necessary for clearance of synaptic autophagosomes. We observed that autophagy at the synapse can be modulated in vivo by the state of neuronal activity, that autophagosomes undergo UNC-16/JIP3-mediated retrograde transport, and that autophagosomes containing synaptic material mature in the cell body. Through forward genetic screens, we then determined that autophagosome maturation in the cell body depends on the protease ATG-4.2, but not the related ATG-4.1, and that ATG-4.2 can cleave LGG-1/Atg8/GABARAP from membranes. Our studies revealed that ATG-4.2 is specifically necessary for the maturation and clearance of autophagosomes and that defects in transport and ATG-4.2-mediated maturation genetically interact to enhance abnormal accumulation of autophagosomes in neurons.

Abstract: Summary
The pervasive nature of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription requires efficient termination. A key player in this process is the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) factor PCF11, which directly binds to the Pol II C-terminal domain and dismantles elongating Pol II from DNA in vitro. We demonstrate that PCF11-mediated termination is essential for vertebrate development. A range of genomic analyses, including mNET-seq, 3′ mRNA-seq, chromatin RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq, reveals that PCF11 enhances transcription termination and stimulates early polyadenylation genome-wide. PCF11 binds preferentially between closely spaced genes, where it prevents transcriptional interference and consequent gene downregulation. Notably, PCF11 is sub-stoichiometric to the CPA complex. Low levels of PCF11 are maintained by an auto-regulatory mechanism involving premature termination of its own transcript and are important for normal development. Both in human cell culture and during zebrafish development, PCF11 selectively attenuates the expression of other transcriptional regulators by premature CPA and termination.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative 3ʹ untranslated regions (3ʹ UTRs) are widespread, but their functional roles are largely unknown. We investigated the function of the long BIRC3 3ʹ UTR, which is upregulated in leukemia. The 3ʹ UTR does not regulate BIRC3 protein localization or abundance but is required for CXCR4-mediated B cell migration. We established an experimental pipeline to study the mechanism of regulation and used mass spectrometry to identify BIRC3 protein interactors. In addition to 3ʹ-UTR-independent interactors involved in known BIRC3 functions, we detected interactors that bind only to BIRC3 protein encoded from the mRNA with the long 3ʹ UTR. They regulate several functions, including CXCR4 trafficking. We further identified RNA-binding proteins differentially bound to the alternative 3ʹ UTRs and found that cooperative binding of Staufen and HuR mediates 3ʹ-UTR-dependent complex formation. We show that the long 3ʹ UTR is required for the formation of specific protein complexes that enable additional functions of BIRC3 protein beyond its 3ʹ-UTR-independent functions.

Abstract: Summary
The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) delays anaphase onset until sister chromosomes are bound to microtubules from opposite spindle poles. Only then can dynamic microtubules produce tension across sister kinetochores. The interdependence of kinetochore attachment and tension has proved challenging to understanding SAC mechanisms. Whether the SAC responds simply to kinetochore attachment or to tension status remains obscure. Unlike higher eukaryotes, budding yeast kinetochores bind only one microtubule, simplifying the relation between attachment and tension. We developed a Taxol-sensitive yeast model to reduce tension in fully assembled spindles. Our results show that low tension on bipolar-attached kinetochores delays anaphase onset, independent of detachment. The delay is transient relative to that imposed by unattached kinetochores. Furthermore, it is mediated by Bub1 and Bub3, but not Mad1, Mad2, and Mad3 (BubR1). Our results demonstrate that reduced tension delays anaphase onset via a signal that is temporally and mechanistically distinct from that produced by unattached kinetochores.

Abstract: Summary
The melanocortin system is a brain circuit that influences energy balance by regulating energy intake and expenditure. In addition, the brain-melanocortin system controls adipose tissue metabolism to optimize fuel mobilization and storage. Specifically, increased brain-melanocortin signaling or negative energy balance promotes lipid mobilization by increasing sympathetic nervous system input to adipose tissue. In contrast, calorie-independent mechanisms favoring energy storage are less understood. Here, we demonstrate that reduction of brain-melanocortin signaling actively promotes fat mass gain by activating the lipogenic program and adipocyte and endothelial cell proliferation in white fat depots independently of caloric intake via efferent nerve fibers conveyed by the common hepatic branch of the vagus nerve. Those vagally regulated obesogenic signals also contribute to the fat mass gain following chronic high-fat diet feeding. These data reveal a physiological mechanism whereby the brain controls energy stores that may contribute to increased susceptibility to obesity.

Abstract: Only a few studies on the development of the passerine spermatozoon are available, yet species variations in the conformation as well as structure of the generally helical acrosome have been reported. This study of spermiogenesis in the Carib grackle (Quiscalus lugubris) intended to provide a deeper understanding of the development of the sperm, and in particular to investigate the bi-partite nature and development of the acrosome as well as its relationship with the nucleus, in the absence of a perforatorium that is found in most non-passerine birds. The acrosomal vesicle already displays a bi-partite nature in the acrosomal granule within the Golgi complex, and the attachment of the dense granule (future acrosomal core) within the crest part (future acrosomal crest) establishes polarity as it approaches and attaches to the nucleus. Thereafter, they develop variably. The acrosomal crest leads the elongation and spiraling of the acrosome, and the core portion contributes significantly to the formation of the keel of the crest part. The rounded, core-bearing part of the base of the acrosome progressively indents and fits into the concavity, thus formed, at the anterior part of the nucleus. The possible homology of the acrosomal complex (including the perforatorium) and the nucleus between non-passerine and passerine birds was discussed. The centriolar complex comprises both the proximal and distal centrioles in all spermatids and spermatozoa. The mitochondria undergo a number of morphological changes, including size and electron-density, from the round spermatid through to the mature spermatid; changes that are probably influenced by their functional states in the different evolving phases of the spermatids.

Abstract: Summary
Gata4, Hand2, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GHMT) can reprogram transduced fibroblasts into induced pacemaker-like myocytes (iPMs), but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we explore the role of Hand2 in iPM formation by using a combination of transcriptome, genome, and biochemical assays. We found many shared transcriptional signatures between iPMs and the endogenous sinoatrial node (SAN), yet key regulatory networks remain missing. We demonstrate that Hand2 augments chromatin accessibility at loci involved in sarcomere organization, electrical coupling, and membrane depolarization. Focusing on an established cardiac Hand2 cistrome, we observe selective reorganization of chromatin accessibility to promote pacemaker-specific gene expression. Moreover, we identify a Hand2 cardiac subtype diversity (CSD) domain through biochemical analysis of the N terminus. By integrating our RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets, we highlight desmosome organization as a hallmark feature of iPM formation. Collectively, our results illuminate Hand2-dependent mechanisms that may guide future efforts to rationally improve iPM formation.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the mechanism of reprogramming is confounded by heterogeneity due to the low efficiency and differential kinetics of obtaining induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells. Therefore, we increased the efficiency with a combination of epigenomic modifiers and signaling molecules and profiled the transcriptomes of individual reprogramming cells. Contrary to the established temporal order, somatic gene inactivation and upregulation of cell cycle, epithelial, and early pluripotency genes can be triggered independently such that any combination of these events can occur in single cells. Sustained co-expression of Epcam, Nanog, and Sox2 with other genes is required to progress toward iPSCs. Ehf, Phlda2, and translation initiation factor Eif4a1 play functional roles in robust iPSC generation. Using regulatory network analysis, we identify a critical role for signaling inhibition by 2i in repressing somatic expression and synergy between the epigenomic modifiers ascorbic acid and a Dot1L inhibitor for pluripotency gene activation.

Abstract: Summary
Cohesin exists in two variants carrying either STAG/SA1 or SA2. Here we have addressed their specific contributions to the unique spatial organization of the mouse embryonic stem cell genome, which ensures super-enhancer-dependent transcription of pluripotency factors and repression of lineage-specification genes within Polycomb domains. We find that cohesin-SA2 facilitates Polycomb domain compaction through Polycomb repressing complex 1 (PRC1) recruitment and promotes the establishment of long-range interaction networks between distant Polycomb-bound promoters that are important for gene repression. Cohesin-SA1, in contrast, disrupts these networks, while preserving topologically associating domain (TAD) borders. The diverse effects of both complexes on genome topology may reflect two modes of action of cohesin. One, likely involving loop extrusion, establishes overall genome arrangement in TADs together with CTCF and prevents excessive segregation of same-class compartment regions. The other is required for organization of local transcriptional hubs such as Polycomb domains and super-enhancers, which define cell identity.

Abstract: Aromatase plays a central role in ovarian differentiation and development in teleosts. In the present study, we identified a cyp19a1a homologue from the ovary of Schizothorax prenanti and analysed its expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Cyp19a1a of S. prenanti showed high homology with that of other teleosts, especially S. kozlovi. The ovary and testis were the main sites of cyp19a1a expression in S. prenanti, and cyp19a1a transcript levels peaked in the mid-vitellogenic (MVG)-stage ovary and the mid-spermatogenic (MS)-stage testis. Signals of Cyp19a1a immunopositivity were detected in the spermatocytes and follicular cells of cortical alveolar-stage and MVG oocytes but not in spermatogonia or spermatids. Taken together, these findings indicate that Cyp19a1a may play an important role in oocyte vitellogenesis as well as spermatocyte development in S. prenanti.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes occurs at promoter-proximal regions wherein transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pauses before proceeding toward productive elongation. The role of chromatin in pausing remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the histone deacetylase SIRT6 binds to Pol II and prevents the release of the negative elongation factor (NELF), thus stabilizing Pol II promoter-proximal pausing. Genetic depletion of SIRT6 or its chromatin deficiency upon glucose deprivation causes intragenic enrichment of acetylated histone H3 at lysines 9 (H3K9ac) and 56 (H3K56ac), activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9)—that phosphorylates NELF and the carboxyl terminal domain of Pol II—and enrichment of the positive transcription elongation factors MYC, BRD4, PAF1, and the super elongation factors AFF4 and ELL2. These events lead to increased expression of genes involved in metabolism, protein synthesis, and embryonic development. Our results identified SIRT6 as a Pol II promoter-proximal pausing-dedicated histone deacetylase.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription of developmental genes is controlled by multiple enhancers. Frequently, more than one enhancer can activate transcription from the same promoter in the same cells. How is regulatory information from multiple enhancers combined to determine the overall expression output? We measure nascent transcription driven by a pair of shadow enhancers, each enhancer of the pair separately, and each duplicated, using live imaging in Drosophila embryos. This set of constructs allows us to quantify the input-output function describing signal integration by two enhancers. We show that signal integration performed by these shadow enhancers and duplications varies across the expression pattern, implying that how their activities are combined depends on the transcriptional regulators bound to the enhancers in different parts of the embryo. Characterizing signal integration by multiple enhancers is a critical step in developing conceptual and computational models of gene expression at the locus level, where multiple enhancers control transcription together.

Abstract: Summary
During development, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) migrate extensively throughout the spinal cord. However, their migration is restricted at transition zones (TZs). At these specialized locations, unique glial cells in both zebrafish and mice play a role in preventing peripheral OPC migration, but the mechanisms of this regulation are not understood. To elucidate the mechanisms that mediate OPC segregation at motor exit point (MEP) TZs, we performed an unbiased small-molecule screen. Using chemical screening and in vivo imaging, we discovered that inhibition of A2a adenosine receptors (ARs) causes ectopic OPC migration out of the spinal cord. We provide in vivo evidence that neuromodulation, partially mediated by adenosine, influences OPC migration specifically at the MEP TZ. This work opens exciting possibilities for understanding how OPCs reach their final destinations during development and identifies mechanisms that could promote their migration in disease.

Abstract: Summary
Most cancer cells exhibit metabolic flexibility, enabling them to withstand fluctuations in intratumoral concentrations of glucose (and other nutrients) and changes in oxygen availability. While these adaptive responses make it difficult to achieve clinically useful anti-tumor responses when targeting a single metabolic pathway, they can also serve as targetable metabolic vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically exploited. Previously, we demonstrated that inhibition of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) significantly disrupts mitochondrial metabolism and that this results in substantial antitumor activity in animal models of breast cancer. Here we show that ERRα inhibition interferes with pyruvate entry into mitochondria by inhibiting the expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1). This results in a dramatic increase in the reliance of cells on glutamine oxidation and the pentose phosphate pathway to maintain nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) homeostasis. In this manner, ERRα inhibition increases the efficacy of glutaminase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitors, a finding that has clinical significance.

Abstract: Summary
Culture and sequencing have produced divergent hypotheses about cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections. Culturing suggests that CF lungs are uninfected before colonization by a limited group of CF pathogens. Sequencing suggests diverse communities of mostly oral bacteria inhabit lungs early on and diversity decreases as disease progresses. We studied the lung microbiota of CF children using bronchoscopy and sequencing, with measures to reduce contamination. We found no evidence for oral bacterial communities in lung lavages that lacked CF pathogens. Lavage microbial diversity varied widely, but decreases in diversity appeared to be driven by increased CF pathogen abundance, which reduced the signal from contaminants. Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Veillonella DNA was detected in some lavages containing CF pathogens, but DNA from these organisms was vastly exceeded by CF pathogen DNA and was not associated with inflammation. These findings support the hypothesis that established CF pathogens are primarily responsible for CF lung infections.

Abstract: Summary
Hantavirus infection, which causes severe zoonotic diseases with high mortality in humans, has become a global public health concern. Here, we demonstrate that Hantaan virus (HTNV), the prevalent prototype of the hantavirus in Asia, can restrain innate immune responses by manipulating host autophagy flux. HTNV induces complete mitophagy at the early stage of infection but incomplete autophagy at the late stage, and these responses involve the viral glycoprotein (Gn) and nucleocapsid protein (NP), respectively. Gn translocates to mitochondria and interacts with TUFM, recruiting LC3B and promoting mitophagy. Gn-induced mitophagy inhibits type I interferon (IFN) responses by degrading MAVS. Additionally, we found that NP competes with Gn for binding to LC3B, which inhibits Gn-mediated autophagosome formation, and interacts with SNAP29, which prevents autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Thus, NP disturbs the autophagic degradation of Gn. These findings highlight how hantaviruses repurpose host autophagy and evade innate immune responses for their life cycle and pathogenesis.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle deficiency in the 3-phosphoinositide (PtdInsP) phosphatase myotubularin (MTM1) causes myotubular myopathy which is associated with severe depression of voltage-activated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release through ryanodine receptors. In the present study we aimed at further understanding how Ca2+ release is altered in MTM1-deficient muscle fibers, at rest and during activation. While in wild-type muscle fibers, SR Ca2+ release exhibits fast stereotyped kinetics of activation and decay throughout the voltage range of activation, Ca2+ release in MTM1-deficient muscle fibers exhibits slow and unconventional kinetics at intermediate voltages, suggestive of partial loss of the normal control of ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel activity. In addition, the diseased muscle fibers at rest exhibit spontaneous elementary Ca2+ release events at a frequency 30 times greater than that of control fibers. Eighty percent of the events have spatiotemporal properties of archetypal Ca2+ sparks while the rest take either the form of lower amplitude, longer duration Ca2+ release events or of a combination thereof. The events occur at preferred locations in the fibers, indicating spatially uneven distribution of the parameters determining spontaneous ryanodine receptor 1 opening. Spatially large Ca2+ release sources were obviously involved in some of these events, suggesting that opening of ryanodine receptors in one cluster can activate opening of ryanodine receptors in a neighboring one. Overall results demonstrate that opening of Ca2+-activated ryanodine receptors is promoted both at rest and during excitation-contraction coupling in MTM1-deficient muscle fibers. Because access to this activation mode is denied to ryanodine receptors in healthy skeletal muscle, this may play an important role in the associated disease situation.

Abstract: Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) promotes the differentiation of non-osteogenic mesenchymal cells to osteogenic cells. In this study, we isolated human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) and investigated the effects of recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) and extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]out) on the osteogenic differentiation of hASCs. rhBMP-2 promoted calcium deposition in hASCs and stimulated the mRNA expressions of six proteins known to be involved in the osteogenic differentiation of hASCs: Runx2, osterix, alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin. Elevation of [Ca2+]out enhanced the level of alkaline phosphatase enzyme, increased the mRNA expressions of Runx2 and osteocalcin and induced the expressions of BMP-2 mRNA and protein in hASCs. Elevation of [Ca2+]out transiently increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]in) due to activation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). The Ca2+-induced expressions of BMP-2 mRNA and protein were inhibited by the calmodulin antagonist, W-7. Furthermore, elevation of [Ca2+]out decreased the cytoplasmic level of phosphorylated nuclear factor of activated T-cell-2 (NFAT-2) and increased the nuclear level of dephosphorylated NFAT2. Taken together, these results suggest that rhBMP-2 promotes the osteogenic differentiation of hASCs. Furthermore, an increase in [Ca2+]out enhances the expression of BMP-2 via activation of the CaSR, elevation of [Ca2+]in and stimulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NFAT-signaling pathways.

Abstract: Background
The rhythmic contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is governed by pacemaker electrical potentials, also termed slow waves, which are calcium currents generated by interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs). Malfunction of pacemaker rhythms contributes to a number of clinically challenging gastrointestinal motility disorders.
Method
A microelectrode array (MEA) was used to record slow waves in vitro from intact GI tissues freshly isolated from the ICR mouse and Suncus murinus. The effects of temperature, extracellular calcium and potassium concentrations on pacemaker potentials were quantified using spatiotemporal metrics.
Results
Pacemaker frequency decreased from the duodenum to the ileum in the mouse, but this phenomenon was less significant in Suncus murinus. In both the mouse and Suncus murinus, the stomach had a much lower pacemaker frequency than the intestine. Propagation velocity and amplitude were highest in the proximal intestine. Temperature significantly increased pacemaker frequency in the intestinal tissues of both species. Removal of Ca2+ from the medium inhibited pacemaker potential and increasing the Ca2+ concentration increased pacemaker frequency in the mouse ileum. Increasing K+ concentration decreased pacemaker frequency in the absence of nifedipine.
Conclusions
The MEA allows efficient investigation of gut pacemaker frequency and propagation.

Abstract: Summary
Secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) are mainly known for their role as extracellular modulators and tumor suppressors that downregulate Wnt signaling. Using the established (CRISPR/Cas9 targeting promoters of SFRPs and targeting SFRPs transcript) system, we find that nuclear SFRPs interact with β-catenin and either promote or suppress TCF4 recruitment. SFRPs bind with β-catenin on both their N and C termini, which the repressive effects caused by SFRP-β-catenin-N-terminus binding overpower the promoting effects of their binding at the C terminus. By high Wnt activity, β-catenin and SFRPs only bind with their C termini, which results in the upregulation of β-catenin transcriptional activity and cancer stem cell (CSC)-related genes. Furthermore, we identify disulfide bonds of the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and two threonine phosphorylation events of the netrin-related motif (NTR) domain of SFRPs that are essential for their role as biphasic modulators, suggesting that SFRPs are biphasic modulators of Wnt signaling-elicited CSC properties beyond extracellular control.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies find that sugar tastes less intense to humans with obesity, but whether this sensory change is a cause or a consequence of obesity is unclear. To tackle this question, we study the effects of a high sugar diet on sweet taste sensation and feeding behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. On this diet, fruit flies have lower taste responses to sweet stimuli, overconsume food, and develop obesity. Excess dietary sugar, but not obesity or dietary sweetness alone, caused taste deficits and overeating via the cell-autonomous action of the sugar sensor O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) in the sweet-sensing neurons. Correcting taste deficits by manipulating the excitability of the sweet gustatory neurons or the levels of OGT protected animals from diet-induced obesity. Our work demonstrates that the reshaping of sweet taste sensation by excess dietary sugar drives obesity and highlights the role of glucose metabolism in neural activity and behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling diversity and subsequent complexity in higher eukaryotes is partially explained by one gene encoding a polypeptide with multiple biochemical functions in different cellular contexts. For example, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is functionally characterized as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, yet this dual classification confounds the cell biology and clinical literatures. Identified via complementary biochemical, organellar, and cellular approaches, we report that MDM2 negatively regulates NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa Fe-S protein 1 (NDUFS1), leading to decreased mitochondrial respiration, marked oxidative stress, and commitment to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. MDM2 directly binds and sequesters NDUFS1, preventing its mitochondrial localization and ultimately causing complex I and supercomplex destabilization and inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The MDM2 amino-terminal region is sufficient to bind NDUFS1, alter supercomplex assembly, and induce apoptosis. Finally, this pathway is independent of p53, and several mitochondrial phenotypes are observed in Drosophila and murine models expressing transgenic Mdm2.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial exposures can define an individual’s basal immune state. Cohousing specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice with pet store mice, which harbor numerous infectious microbes, results in global changes to the immune system, including increased circulating phagocytes and elevated inflammatory cytokines. How these differences in the basal immune state influence the acute response to systemic infection is unclear. Cohoused mice exhibit enhanced protection from virulent Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection, but increased morbidity and mortality to polymicrobial sepsis. Cohoused mice have more TLR2+ and TLR4+ phagocytes, enhancing recognition of microbes through pattern-recognition receptors. However, the response to a TLR2 ligand is muted in cohoused mice, whereas the response to a TLR4 ligand is greatly amplified, suggesting a basis for the distinct response to Listeria monocytogenes and sepsis. Our data illustrate how microbial exposure can enhance the immune response to unrelated challenges but also increase the risk of immunopathology from a severe cytokine storm.

Abstract: Summary
IL-17-producing γδ T cells express oligoclonal Vγ4+ and Vγ6+ TCRs, mainly develop in the prenatal thymus, and later persist as long-lived self-renewing cells in all kinds of tissues. However, their exchange between tissues and the mechanisms of their tissue-specific adaptation remain poorly understood. Here, single-cell RNA-seq profiling identifies IL-17-producing Vγ6+ T cells as a highly homogeneous Scart1+ population in contrast to their Scart2+ IL-17-producing Vγ4+ T cell counterparts. Parabiosis demonstrates that Vγ6+ T cells are fairly tissue resident in the thymus, peripheral lymph nodes, and skin. There, Scart1+ Vγ6+ T cells display tissue-specific gene expression signatures in the skin, characterized by steady-state production of the cytokines IL-17A and amphiregulin as well as by high expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2a1 protein family. Together, this study demonstrates how Scart1+ Vγ6+ T cells undergo tissue-specific functional adaptation to persist as effector cells in their skin habitat.

Abstract: Summary
The adult mouse brain contains an extensive neurogenic niche in the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles. This epithelium, which has a unique pinwheel organization, contains multiciliated ependymal (E1) cells and neural stem cells (B1). This postnatal germinal epithelium develops from the embryonic ventricular zone, but the lineage relationship between E1 and B1 cells remains unknown. Distinct subpopulations of radial glia (RG) cells in late embryonic and early postnatal development either expand their apical domain >11-fold to form E1 cells or retain small apical domains that coalesce into the centers of pinwheels to form B1 cells. Using independent methods of lineage tracing, we show that individual RG cells can give rise to clones containing E1 and B1 cells. This study reveals key developmental steps in the formation of the postnatal germinal niche and the shared cellular origin of E1 and B1 cells.

Abstract: Summary
Repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is the most common cause of the neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9-ALS) and is linked to the unconventional translation of five dipeptide-repeat polypeptides (DPRs). The two enriched in arginine, poly(GR) and poly(PR), infiltrate liquid-like nucleoli, co-localize with the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM1), and alter the phase separation behavior of NPM1 in vitro. Here, we show that poly(PR) DPRs bind tightly to a long acidic tract within the intrinsically disordered region of NPM1, altering its phase separation with nucleolar partners to the extreme of forming large, soluble complexes that cause droplet dissolution in vitro. In cells, poly(PR) DPRs disperse NPM1 from nucleoli and entrap rRNA in static condensates in a DPR-length-dependent manner. We propose that R-rich DPR toxicity involves disrupting the role of phase separation by NPM1 in organizing ribosomal proteins and RNAs within the nucleolus.

Abstract: Summary
Ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapy are standard-of-care treatments for glioblastoma (GBM) patients and both result in DNA damage, however, the clinical efficacy is limited due to therapeutic resistance. We identified a mechanism of such resistance mediated by phosphorylation of PTEN on tyrosine 240 (pY240-PTEN) by FGFR2. pY240-PTEN is rapidly elevated and bound to chromatin through interaction with Ki-67 in response to IR treatment and facilitates the recruitment of RAD51 to promote DNA repair. Blocking Y240 phosphorylation confers radiation sensitivity to tumors and extends survival in GBM preclinical models. Y240F-Pten knockin mice showed radiation sensitivity. These results suggest that FGFR-mediated pY240-PTEN is a key mechanism of radiation resistance and is an actionable target for improving radiotherapy efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Despite recent progress in engineering native trimeric HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) mimics as vaccine candidates, Env trimers often induce vaccine-matched neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. Understanding the specificities of autologous NAb responses and the underlying molecular mechanisms restricting the neutralization breadth is therefore informative to improve vaccine efficacy. Here, we delineate the response specificity by single B cell sorting and serum analysis of guinea pigs immunized with BG505 SOSIP.664 Env trimers. Our results reveal a prominent immune target containing both conserved and strain-specific residues in the C3/V4 region of Env in trimer-vaccinated animals. The defined NAb response shares a high degree of similarity with the early NAb response developed by a naturally infected infant from whom the HIV virus strain BG505 was isolated and later developed a broadly NAb response. Our study describes strain-specific responses and their possible evolution pathways, thereby highlighting the potential to broaden NAb responses by immunogen re-design.
