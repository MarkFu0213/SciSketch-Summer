Abstract: Summary
Drosophila development is governed by distinct ecdysone steroid pulses that initiate spatially and temporally defined gene expression programs. The translation of these signals into tissue-specific responses is crucial for metamorphosis, but the mechanisms that confer specificity to systemic ecdysone pulses are far from understood. Here, we identify Bric-à-brac 2 (Bab2) as an ecdysone-responsive transcriptional repressor that controls temporal gene expression during larval to pupal transition. Bab2 is necessary to terminate Salivary gland secretion (Sgs) gene expression, while premature Bab2 expression blocks Sgs genes and causes precocious salivary gland histolysis. The timely expression of bab2 is controlled by the ecdysone-responsive transcription factor Broad, and manipulation of EcR/USP/Broad signaling induces inappropriate Bab2 expression and termination of Sgs gene expression. Bab2 directly binds to Sgs loci in vitro and represses all Sgs genes in vivo. Our work characterizes Bab2 as a temporal regulator of somatic gene expression in response to systemic ecdysone signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Coordinated intracellular and extracellular signaling is critical to synapse development and functional neural circuit wiring. Here, we report that unesterified docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) regulates functional synapse formation in vivo via retinoid X receptor α (Rxra) signaling. Using Rxra conditional knockout (cKO) mice and virus-mediated transient gene expression, we show that endogenous Rxra plays important roles in regulating spinogenesis and excitatory synaptic transmission in cortical pyramidal neurons. We further show that the effects of RXRA are mediated through its DNA-binding domain in a cell-autonomous and reversible manner. Moreover, unesterified DHA increases spine formation and excitatory synaptic transmission in vivo in an Rxra-dependent fashion. Rxra cKO mice generally behave normally but show deficits in behavior tasks associated with social memory. Together, these results demonstrate that unesterified DHA signals through RXRA to regulate spinogenesis and functional synapse formation, providing insight into the mechanism through which DHA promotes brain development and cognitive function.

Abstract: Summary
If not properly regulated, the inflammatory immune response can promote carcinogenesis, as evident in colorectal cancer (CRC). Aiming to gain mechanistic insight into the link between inflammation and CRC, we perform transcriptomics analysis of human CRC, identifying a strong correlation between expression of the serine protease granzyme A (GzmA) and inflammation. In a dextran sodium sulfate and azoxymethane (DSS/AOM) mouse model, deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of extracellular GzmA both attenuate gut inflammation and prevent CRC development, including the initial steps of cell transformation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, extracellular GzmA induces NF-κB-dependent IL-6 production in macrophages, which in turn promotes STAT3 activation in cultured CRC cells. Accordingly, colon tissues from DSS/AOM-treated, GzmA-deficient animals present reduced levels of pSTAT3. By identifying GzmA as a proinflammatory protease that promotes CRC development, these findings provide information on mechanisms that link immune cell infiltration to cancer progression and present GzmA as a therapeutic target for CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitination is essential for numerous eukaryotic cellular processes. Here, we show that the type III effector CteC from Chromobacterium violaceum functions as an adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase that specifically modifies ubiquitin via threonine ADP-ribosylation on residue T66. The covalent modification prevents the transfer of ubiquitin from ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, which inhibits subsequent ubiquitin activation by E2 and E3 enzymes in the ubiquitination cascade and leads to the shutdown of polyubiquitin synthesis in host cells. This unique modification also causes dysfunction of polyubiquitin chains in cells, thereby blocking host ubiquitin signaling. The disruption of host ubiquitination by CteC plays a crucial role in C. violaceum colonization in mice during infection. CteC represents a family of effector proteins in pathogens of hosts from different kingdoms. All the members of this family specifically ADP-ribosylate ubiquitin. The action of CteC reveals a new mechanism for interfering with host ubiquitination by pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Hypotonic stress causes the activation of swelling-activated nonselective cation channels (NSCCs), which leads to Ca2+-dependent regulatory volume decrease (RVD) and adaptive maintenance of the cell volume; however, the molecular identities of the osmosensitive NSCCs remain unclear. Here, we identified TMEM63B as an osmosensitive NSCC activated by hypotonic stress. TMEM63B is enriched in the inner ear sensory hair cells. Genetic deletion of TMEM63B results in necroptosis of outer hair cells (OHCs) and progressive hearing loss. Mechanistically, the TMEM63B channel mediates hypo-osmolarity-induced Ca2+ influx, which activates Ca2+-dependent K+ channels required for the maintenance of OHC morphology. These findings demonstrate that TMEM63B is an osmosensor of the mammalian inner ear and the long-sought cation channel mediating Ca2+-dependent RVD.

Abstract: Summary
Firing activity of external globus pallidus (GPe) is crucial for motor control and is severely perturbed in dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive muscle contractions. Here, we show that GPe projection neurons exhibit a reduction of firing frequency and an irregular pattern in a DYT1 dystonia model. Optogenetic activation of the striatopallidal pathway fails to reset pacemaking activity of GPe neurons in mutant mice. Abnormal firing is paralleled by alterations in motor learning. We find that loss of dopamine D2 receptor-dependent inhibition causes increased GABA input at striatopallidal synapses, with subsequent downregulation of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels. Accordingly, enhancing in vivo HCN channel activity or blocking GABA release restores both the ability of striatopallidal inputs to pause ongoing GPe activity and motor coordination deficits. Our findings demonstrate an impaired striatopallidal connectivity, supporting the central role of GPe in motor control and, more importantly, identifying potential pharmacological targets for dystonia.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic dysregulation is a critical feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Among various autism-associated genes, cortactin binding protein 2 (CTTNBP2) is a cytoskeleton regulator predominantly expressed in neurons and highly enriched at dendritic spines. Here, using Cttnbp2 knockout and ASD-linked mutant mice, we demonstrate that Cttnbp2 deficiency reduces zinc levels in the brain, alters synaptic protein targeting, impairs dendritic spine formation and ultrastructure of postsynaptic density, and influences neuronal activation and autism-like behaviors. A link to autism, the NMDAR-SHANK pathway, and zinc-related regulation are three features shared by CTTNBP2-regulated synaptic proteins. Zinc supplementation rescues the synaptic expression of CTTNBP2-regulated proteins. Moreover, zinc supplementation and administration of D-cycloserine, an NMDAR coagonist, improve the social behaviors of Cttnbp2-deficient mice. We suggest that CTTNBP2 controls the synaptic expression of a set of zinc-regulated autism-associated genes and influences NMDAR function and signaling, providing an example of how genetic and environmental factor crosstalk controls social behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Stem/progenitor cells exhibit high proliferation rates, elevated nutrient uptake, altered metabolic flux, and stress-induced genome instability. O-GlcNAcylation is an essential post-translational modification mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which act in a nutrient- and stress-responsive manner. The precise role of O-GlcNAc in adult stem cells and the relationship between O-GlcNAc and the DNA damage response (DDR) is poorly understood. Here, we show that hyper-O-GlcNacylation leads to elevated insulin signaling, hyperproliferation, and DDR activation that mimic the glucose- and oxidative-stress-induced response. We discover a feedback mechanism involving key downstream effectors of DDR, ATM, ATR, and CHK1/2 that regulates OGT stability to promote O-GlcNAcylation and elevate DDR. This O-GlcNAc-dependent regulatory pathway is critical for maintaining gut homeostasis in Drosophila and the DDR in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our findings reveal a conserved mechanistic link among O-GlcNAc cycling, stem cell self-renewal, and DDR with profound implications for stem-cell-derived diseases including cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Complex networks of regulatory relationships between protein kinases comprise a major component of intracellular signaling. Although many kinase-kinase regulatory relationships have been described in detail, these tend to be limited to well-studied kinases whereas the majority of possible relationships remains unexplored. Here, we implement a data-driven, supervised machine learning method to predict human kinase-kinase regulatory relationships and whether they have activating or inhibiting effects. We incorporate high-throughput data, kinase specificity profiles, and structural information to produce our predictions. The results successfully recapitulate previously annotated regulatory relationships and can reconstruct known signaling pathways from the ground up. The full network of predictions is relatively sparse, with the vast majority of relationships assigned low probabilities. However, it nevertheless suggests denser modes of inter-kinase regulation than normally considered in intracellular signaling research. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear RNA interference (RNAi) pathways work together with histone modifications to regulate gene expression and enact an adaptive response to transposable RNA elements. In the germline, nuclear RNAi can lead to trans-generational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) of gene silencing. We identified and characterized a family of nuclear Argonaute-interacting proteins (ENRIs) that control the strength and target specificity of nuclear RNAi in C. elegans, ensuring faithful inheritance of epigenetic memories. ENRI-1/2 prevent misloading of the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3 with small RNAs that normally effect maternal piRNAs, which prevents precocious nuclear translocation of NRDE-3 in the early embryo. Additionally, they are negative regulators of nuclear RNAi triggered from exogenous sources. Loss of ENRI-3, an unstable protein expressed mostly in the male germline, misdirects the RNAi response to transposable elements and impairs TEI. The ENRIs determine the potency and specificity of nuclear RNAi responses by gating small RNAs into specific nuclear Argonautes.

Abstract: In this study we performed the comprehensive pharmacological analysis of two stereoisomers of 4-chloro-meta-cresol (4CMC), a popular ryanodine receptor (RyR) agonist used in muscle research. Experiments investigating the Ca2+-releasing action of the isomers demonstrated that the most potent isomer was 4-chloro-orto-cresol (4COC) (EC50 = 55 ± 14 μM), although 3-chloro-para-cresol (3CPC) was more effective, as it was able to induce higher magnitude of Ca2+ flux from isolated terminal cisterna vesicles. Nevertheless, 3CPC stimulated the hydrolytic activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATP-ase (SERCA) with an EC50 of 91 ± 17 μM, while 4COC affected SERCA only in the millimolar range (IC50 = 1370 ± 88 μM). IC50 of 4CMC for SERCA pump was 167 ± 8 μM, indicating that 4CMC is not a specific RyR agonist either, as it activated RyR in a similar concentration (EC50 = 121 ± 20 μM). Our data suggest that the use of 4COC might be more beneficial than 4CMC in experiments, when Ca2+ release should be triggered through RyRs without influencing SERCA activity.

Abstract: Recent advances in imaging technology and fluorescent probes have made it possible to gain information about the dynamics of subcellular processes at unprecedented spatiotemporal scales. Unfortunately, a lack of automated tools to efficiently process the resulting imaging data encoding fine details of the biological processes remains a major bottleneck in utilizing the full potential of these powerful experimental techniques. Here we present a computational tool, called PunctaSpecks, that can characterize fluorescence signals arising from a wide range of biological molecules under normal and pathological conditions. Among other things, the program can calculate the number, areas, life-times, and amplitudes of fluorescence signals arising from multiple sources, track diffusing fluorescence sources like moving mitochondria, and determine the overlap probability of two processes or organelles imaged using indicator dyes of different colors. We have tested PunctaSpecks on synthetic time-lapse movies containing mobile fluorescence objects of various sizes, mimicking the activity of biomolecules. The robustness of the software is tested by varying the level of noise along with random but known pattern of appearing, disappearing, and movement of these objects. Next, we use PunctaSpecks to characterize protein-protein interaction involved in store-operated Ca2+ entry through the formation and activation of plasma membrane-bound ORAI1 channel and endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound stromal interaction molecule (STIM), the evolution of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ signals from sub-micrometer size local events into global waves in human cortical neurons, and the activity of Alzheimer’s disease-associated β amyloid pores in the plasma membrane. The tool can also be used to study other dynamical processes imaged through fluorescence molecules. The open source algorithm allows for extending the program to analyze more than two types of biomolecules visualized using markers of different colors.

Abstract: Summary
The notochord is an evolutionary novelty in vertebrates that functions as an important signaling center during development. Notochord ablation in chicken has demonstrated that it is crucial for pancreas development; however, the molecular mechanism has not been fully described. Here, we show that in zebrafish, the loss of function of nog2, a Bmp antagonist expressed in the notochord, impairs β cell differentiation, compatible with the antagonistic role of Bmp in β cell differentiation. In addition, we show that nog2 expression in the notochord is induced by at least one notochord enhancer and its loss of function reduces the number of pancreatic progenitors and impairs β cell differentiation. Tracing Nog2 diffusion, we show that Nog2 emanates from the notochord to the pancreas progenitor domain. Finally, we find a notochord enhancer in human and mice Nog genomic landscapes, suggesting that the acquisition of a Nog notochord enhancer occurred early in the vertebrate phylogeny and contributes to the development of complex organs like the pancreas.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with multiple human malignancies. To evade immune detection, EBV switches between latent and lytic programs. How viral latency is maintained in tumors or in memory B cells, the reservoir for lifelong EBV infection, remains incompletely understood. To gain insights, we performed a human genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in Burkitt lymphoma B cells. Our analyses identified a network of host factors that repress lytic reactivation, centered on the transcription factor MYC, including cohesins, FACT, STAGA, and Mediator. Depletion of MYC or factors important for MYC expression reactivated the lytic cycle, including in Burkitt xenografts. MYC bound the EBV genome origin of lytic replication and suppressed its looping to the lytic cycle initiator BZLF1 promoter. Notably, MYC abundance decreases with plasma cell differentiation, a key lytic reactivation trigger. Our results suggest that EBV senses MYC abundance as a readout of B cell state and highlights Burkitt latency reversal therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
The duality of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of cellular components into membraneless organelles defines the nucleation of both normal and disease processes including stress granule (SG) assembly. From mounting evidence of LLPS utility by viruses, we discover that HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NC) protein condenses into zinc-finger (ZnF)-dependent LLPSs that are dynamically influenced by cytosolic factors. ZnF-dependent and Zinc (Zn2+)-chelation-sensitive NC-LLPS are formed in live cells. NC-Zn2+ ejection reverses the HIV-1 blockade on SG assembly, inhibits NC-SG assembly, disrupts NC/Gag-genomic RNA (vRNA) ribonucleoprotein complexes, and causes nuclear sequestration of NC and the vRNA, inhibiting Gag expression and virus release. NC ZnF mutagenesis eliminates the HIV-1 blockade of SG assembly and repositions vRNA to SGs. We find that NC-mediated, Zn2+-coordinated phase separation is conserved among diverse retrovirus subfamilies, illustrating that this exquisitely evolved Zn2+-dependent feature of virus replication represents a critical target for pan-antiretroviral therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The redox-based protein S-nitrosylation is a conserved mechanism modulating nitric oxide (NO) signaling and has been considered mainly as a non-enzymatic reaction. S-nitrosylation is regulated by the intracellular NO level that is tightly controlled by S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR). However, the molecular mechanisms regulating S-nitrosylation selectivity remain elusive. Here, we characterize an Arabidopsis “repressor of” gsnor1 (rog1) mutation that specifically suppresses the gsnor1 mutant phenotype. ROG1, identical to the non-canonical catalase, CAT3, is a transnitrosylase that specifically modifies GSNOR1 at Cys-10. The transnitrosylase activity of ROG1 is regulated by a unique and highly conserved Cys-343 residue. A ROG1C343T mutant displays increased catalase but decreased transnitrosylase activities. Consistent with these results, the rog1 mutation compromises responses to NO under both normal and stress conditions. We propose that ROG1 functions as a transnitrosylase to regulate the NO-based redox signaling in plants.

Abstract: Summary
While endothelial cell (EC) function is influenced by mitochondrial metabolism, the role of mitochondrial dynamics in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature, is unknown. Here we show that the inner mitochondrial membrane mitochondrial fusion protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is required for angiogenesis. In response to angiogenic stimuli, OPA1 levels rapidly increase to limit nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NFκB) signaling, ultimately allowing angiogenic genes expression and angiogenesis. Endothelial Opa1 is indeed required in an NFκB-dependent pathway essential for developmental and tumor angiogenesis, impacting tumor growth and metastatization. A first-in-class small molecule-specific OPA1 inhibitor confirms that EC Opa1 can be pharmacologically targeted to curtail tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
The mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) is thought to be involved in the maintenance, repair, and carcinogenesis of the fallopian tube (oviduct) and uterine epithelium. However, conclusive evidence for the conversion of mesenchymal cells to epithelial cells in these organs is lacking. Using embryonal cell lineage tracing with reporters driven by mesenchymal cell marker genes of the female reproductive tract (AMHR2, CSPG4, and PDGFRβ), we show that these reporters are also expressed by some oviductal and uterine epithelial cells at birth. These mesenchymal reporter-positive epithelial cells are maintained in adult mice across multiple pregnancies, respond to ovarian hormones, and form organoids. However, no labeled epithelial cells are present in any oviductal or uterine epithelia when mesenchymal cell labeling was induced in adult mice. Organoids developed from mice labeled in adulthood were also negative for mesenchymal reporters. Collectively, our work found no definitive evidence of MET in the adult fallopian tube and uterine epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Kinetochores are multi-protein machines that form dynamic attachments to microtubules and control chromosome segregation. High fidelity is ensured because kinetochores can monitor attachment status and tension, using this information to activate checkpoints and error-correction mechanisms. To explore how kinetochores achieve this, we used two- and three-color subpixel fluorescence localization to define how proteins from six major complexes (CCAN, MIS12, NDC80, KNL1, RZZ, and SKA) and the checkpoint proteins Bub1, Mad1, and Mad2 are organized in the human kinetochore. This reveals how the outer kinetochore has a high nematic order and is largely invariant to the loss of attachment or tension, except for two mechanical sensors. First, Knl1 unravels to relay tension, and second, NDC80 undergoes jackknifing and loss of nematic order under microtubule detachment, with only the latter wired up to the checkpoint signaling system. This provides insight into how kinetochores integrate mechanical signals to promote error-free chromosome segregation.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma, the predominant adult malignant brain tumor, has been computationally classified into molecular subtypes whose functional relevance remains to be comprehensively established. Tumors from genetically engineered glioblastoma mouse models initiated by identical driver mutations in distinct cells of origin portray unique transcriptional profiles reflective of their respective lineage. Here, we identify corresponding transcriptional profiles in human glioblastoma and describe patient-derived xenografts with species-conserved subtype-discriminating functional properties. The oligodendrocyte lineage-associated glioblastoma subtype requires functional ERBB3 and harbors unique therapeutic sensitivities. These results highlight the importance of cell lineage in glioblastoma independent of driver mutations and provide a methodology for functional glioblastoma classification for future clinical investigations.

Abstract: Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) is a potentially useful biological product for bone regeneration. This study investigated whether BMAC can be enriched by local minor corticotomies. Five 4-month-old domestic pigs were used with each pig undergoing two minor corticotomies at one randomly-selected tibia. Two weeks after the operation, bone marrow was aspirated from both tibiae and processed into BMAC samples. The amount of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the concentration of several regenerative growth factors contained in BMAC, as well as the proliferative and osteogenic differentiation capacity of MSCs, were compared between the corticotomy and the control sides. Another four weeks later, healing of the corticotomies was evaluated by radiographic and histological methods. The results demonstrated that BMAC from the corticotomy side contained significantly more MSCs than the control side. MSCs from the corticotomy side also proliferated significantly faster and tended to have stronger osteogenic differentiation than those from the control side. In contrast, the protein concentration of TGF-β, BMP-2 and PDGF contained in BMAC was only minimally changed by the corticotomies. The corticotomies in all pigs healed uneventfully, showing complete obliteration of the corticotomy gaps on CT images. Comparison between the two sides showed that the corticotomy side had thicker and denser cortical bone and more abundant osteogenic cell differentiation than the control side. These findings suggest that the quantity and proliferative/osteogenic differentiation capacity of MSCs contained in local BMAC can be enhanced by minor corticotomies, and spontaneous healing of the corticotomy can be completed within 6 weeks of the operation.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master modulator of cellular growth, and its aberrant regulation is recurrently documented within breast cancer. While the small GTPase Rheb1 is the canonical activator of mTORC1, Rheb1-independent mechanisms of mTORC1 activation have also been reported but have not been fully understood. Employing multiple transgenic mouse models of breast cancer, we report that ablation of Rheb1 significantly impedes mammary tumorigenesis. In the absence of Rheb1, a block in tumor initiation can be overcome by multiple independent mutations in Mtor to allow Rheb1-independent reactivation of mTORC1. We further demonstrate that the mTOR kinase is indispensable for tumor initiation as the genetic ablation of mTOR abolishes mammary tumorigenesis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that mTORC1 activation is indispensable for mammary tumor initiation and that tumors acquire alternative mechanisms of mTORC1 activation.

Abstract: Summary
UHRF1 is a key regulator in DNA methylation maintenance. It binds histone H3K9me2/3 and hemi-methylated DNA and recruits DNMT1 to DNA replication forks during S phase. However, the regulatory mechanism of hemi-methylated DNA binding activity of UHRF1 remains unknown. In this study, we reveal that acetylation of UHRF1 is regulated by PCAF and HDAC1. We show that UHRF1 acetylation at K490 attenuates its binding affinity to hemi-methylated DNA. We analyze genome-wide DNA methylation and gene-expression patterns using stable cell lines and discover that cells where the endogenous UHRF1 is replaced with an acetyl-mimetic (UHRF1 K490Q) mutant show deficiencies in inherited DNA methylation and show different gene-expression patterns in genes related to cell survival. These results reveal that precise regulation of UHRF1 acetylation is required to maintain DNA methylation during cell division and control cell survival.

Abstract: The ovarian development of Callinectes ornatus and Arenaeus cribrarius was described using histochemistry and ultrastructure. Both species shows the same ovarian stages, which are the juvenile (JUV), adult rudimentary (RUD), developing (DEV), intermediary (INT), mature (MAT), and spent (OV) stages. The JUV and RUD stages showed similar characteristics, and previtellogenesis is characterized by meiotic prophase chromosomes. In the primary vitellogenesis, the oocyte cytoplasm shows many small and large cytoplasmic glycoprotein vesicles. These vesicles correspond to the dilated cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), which produces the immature (endogenous) yolk. Secondary vitellogenesis (exogenous phase) begins at the DEV stage with the fusion of pinocytic vesicles and vesicles with immature yolks to form mature yolk granules. At the INT stage, the formation of the chorion begins, and the mature yolks increase in size and number, while the RER diminishes. In the MAT stage, the oocytes are completely formed, and the cytoplasm is filled with mature yolk, lipid droplets, and glycogen. There are no significant variations between the gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices, which allows us to infer that the transfer of reserves from the hepatopancreas is nearly constant during ovarian development, since we observed primiparous and multiparous females in the same sampled population.

Abstract: Summary
Crossover recombination is critical for meiotic chromosome segregation, but how mammalian crossing over is accomplished is poorly understood. Here, we illuminate how strands exchange during meiotic recombination in male mice by analyzing patterns of heteroduplex DNA in recombinant molecules preserved by the mismatch correction deficiency of Msh2–/– mutants. Surprisingly, MSH2-dependent recombination suppression was not evident. However, a substantial fraction of crossover products retained heteroduplex DNA, and some provided evidence of MSH2-independent correction. Biased crossover resolution was observed, consistent with asymmetry between DNA ends in earlier intermediates. Many crossover products yielded no heteroduplex DNA, suggesting dismantling by D-loop migration. Unlike the complexity of crossovers in yeast, these simple modifications of the original double-strand break repair model—asymmetry in recombination intermediates and D-loop migration—may be sufficient to explain most meiotic crossing over in mice while also addressing long-standing questions related to Holliday junction resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Attenuated DNA repair leads to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. BRCA1/BARD1 are the best-known tumor suppressors that promote homology recombination (HR) and arrest cell cycle. However, it remains ambiguous whether and how their E3 ligase activity regulates HR. Here, we demonstrate that upon genotoxic stress, BRCA1 together with BARD1 catalyzes the K48 polyubiquitination on LARP7, a 7SK RNA binding protein known to control RNAPII pausing, and thereby degrades it through the 26S ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Depleting LARP7 suppresses the expression of CDK1 complex, arrests the cell at the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, and reduces BRCA2 phosphorylation, which thereby facilitates RAD51 recruitment to damaged DNA to enhance HR. Importantly, LARP7 depletion observed in breast cancer patients leads to chemoradiotherapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, this study unveils a mechanism by which BRCA1/BARD1 control HR and cell cycle, and highlights LARP7 as a potential target for cancer prevention and therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global challenge, and point-of-care diagnostic classifiers are urgently required. Here, we present a platform for ultra-high-throughput serum and plasma proteomics that builds on ISO13485 standardization to facilitate simple implementation in regulated clinical laboratories. Our low-cost workflow handles up to 180 samples per day, enables high precision quantification, and reduces batch effects for large-scale and longitudinal studies. We use our platform on samples collected from a cohort of early hospitalized cases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and identify 27 potential biomarkers that are differentially expressed depending on the WHO severity grade of COVID-19. They include complement factors, the coagulation system, inflammation modulators, and pro-inflammatory factors upstream and downstream of interleukin 6. All protocols and software for implementing our approach are freely available. In total, this work supports the development of routine proteomic assays to aid clinical decision making and generate hypotheses about potential COVID-19 therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Cell proliferation and inflammation are two metabolically demanding biological processes. How these competing processes are selectively executed in the same cell remains unknown. Here, we report that the enzyme carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartyl transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD) deamidates the RelA subunit of NF-κB in cancer cells to promote aerobic glycolysis and fuel cell proliferation in tumorigenesis. This post-translational modification switches RelA function from mediating the expression of NF-κB-responsive genes to that of glycolytic enzymes, thus shunting the cell’s inflammatory response to aerobic glycolysis. Further, we profiled diverse human cancer cell lines and found that high CAD expression and a subset of RELA mutations correlated with RelA deamidation. And by use of inhibitors of key glycolytic enzymes, we validated the pivotal role of RelA deamidation in tumorigenesis of cancer cell lines. This work illuminates a mechanism by which protein deamidation selectively specifies gene expression and consequent biological processes.

Abstract: Summary
Integration of extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived cues into transcriptional programs is essential primarily in rapidly morphing environments, such as regenerating tissues. Here, we demonstrate that lysyl oxidase (Lox), known for its ECM-modifying activities, primarily collagen crosslinking, also directly regulates transcription factor (TF) localization. Using genetic and pharmacological strategies, we highlight an intracellular role for Lox in myogenic progenitors essential for muscle regeneration. We show that Lox interacts with, and directly oxidizes, vestigial-like 3 (Vgll3), a transcriptional co-activator acting with Mef2 and transcriptional enhancer factor (TEF) TFs. This enzymatic activity is required for Vgll3 cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation in regulation of myogenic differentiation. Our work highlights an additional mechanism for TF subcellular localization facilitating integration of ECM organization with transcriptional output during myogenic differentiation. Modulating this integration mechanism could affect the balance between ECM organization and cell differentiation and serve as a basis for novel therapeutic strategies targeting fibrotic pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
Protozoan parasites in the genus Leishmania produce a broad spectrum of diseases in their human hosts. The strain and species-specific genes controlling these diverse clinical outcomes have remained poorly tractable using reverse genetics approaches. A cryptic sexual cycle involving a meiotic-like process has been described in Leishmania but is so far confined to parasites growing in the sand fly vector. Here, we describe the reproducible in vitro generation of hybrid clones using axenic culture forms of Leishmania tropica promastigotes. Analysis of SNPs marker inheritance and whole-genome sequencing data indicate that the progeny clones are full genomic hybrids. The demonstration that mating-competent forms arise in culture should facilitate experimental study of the mating biology of Leishmania and the generation of large numbers of recombinant parasites for positional cloning of important genes.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we show that β adrenergic signaling coordinately upregulates de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT), and both effects are blocked in mice lacking the cAMP-generating G protein-coupled receptor Gs (Adipo-GsαKO) in adipocytes. However, UCP1 expression but not DNL activation requires rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1. Furthermore, β3-adrenergic agonist CL316243 readily upregulates thermogenic but not lipogenic genes in cultured adipocytes, indicating that additional regulators must operate on DNL in sWAT in vivo. We identify one such factor as thyroid hormone T3, which is elevated locally by adrenergic signaling. T3 administration to wild-type mice enhances both thermogenesis and DNL in sWAT. Mechanistically, T3 action on UCP1 expression in sWAT depends upon cAMP and is blocked in Adipo-GsαKO mice even as elevated DNL persists. Thus, T3 enhances sWAT thermogenesis by amplifying cAMP signaling, while its control of adipocyte DNL can be mediated independently of both cAMP and rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy caused by recurrent mutations in genes encoding transcriptional, chromatin, and/or signaling regulators. The t(8;21) translocation generates the aberrant transcription factor RUNX1-ETO (RUNX1-RUNX1T1), which by itself is insufficient to cause disease. t(8;21) AML patients show extensive chromatin reprogramming and have acquired additional mutations. Therefore, the genomic and developmental effects directly and solely attributable to RUNX1-ETO expression are unclear. To address this, we employ a human embryonic stem cell differentiation system capable of forming definitive myeloid progenitor cells to express RUNX1-ETO in an inducible fashion. Induction of RUNX1-ETO causes extensive chromatin reprogramming by interfering with RUNX1 binding, blocks differentiation, and arrests cellular growth, whereby growth arrest is reversible following RUNX1-ETO removal. Single-cell gene expression analyses show that RUNX1-ETO induction alters the differentiation of early myeloid progenitors, but not of other progenitor types, indicating that oncoprotein-mediated transcriptional reprogramming is highly target cell specific.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor interferon (IFN) signaling promotes PD-L1 expression to suppress T cell-mediated immunosurveillance. We identify the IFN-stimulated non-coding RNA 1 (INCR1) as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcribed from the PD-L1 locus and show that INCR1 controls IFNγ signaling in multiple tumor types. Silencing INCR1 decreases the expression of PD-L1, JAK2, and several other IFNγ-stimulated genes. INCR1 knockdown sensitizes tumor cells to cytotoxic T cell-mediated killing, improving CAR T cell therapy. We discover that PD-L1 and JAK2 transcripts are negatively regulated by binding to HNRNPH1, a nuclear ribonucleoprotein. The primary transcript of INCR1 binds HNRNPH1 to block its inhibitory effects on the neighboring genes PD-L1 and JAK2, enabling their expression. These findings introduce a mechanism of tumor IFNγ signaling regulation mediated by the lncRNA INCR1 and suggest a therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Non-genetic transcriptional variability is a potential mechanism for therapy resistance in melanoma. Specifically, rare subpopulations of cells occupy a transient pre-resistant state characterized by coordinated high expression of several genes and survive therapy. How might these rare states arise and disappear within the population? It is unclear whether the canonical models of probabilistic transcriptional pulsing can explain this behavior, or if it requires special, hitherto unidentified mechanisms. We show that a minimal model of transcriptional bursting and gene interactions can give rise to rare coordinated high expression states. These states occur more frequently in networks with low connectivity and depend on three parameters. While entry into these states is initiated by a long transcriptional burst that also triggers entry of other genes, the exit occurs through independent inactivation of individual genes. Together, we demonstrate that established principles of gene regulation are sufficient to describe this behavior and argue for its more general existence. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Summary
Impairment of microglial clearance activity contributes to beta-amyloid (Aβ) pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While the transcriptome profile of microglia directs microglial functions, how the microglial transcriptome can be regulated to alleviate AD pathology is largely unknown. Here, we show that injection of interleukin (IL)-33 in an AD transgenic mouse model ameliorates Aβ pathology by reprogramming microglial epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles to induce a microglial subpopulation with enhanced phagocytic activity. These IL-33-responsive microglia (IL-33RMs) express a distinct transcriptome signature that is highlighted by increased major histocompatibility complex class II genes and restored homeostatic signature genes. IL-33-induced remodeling of chromatin accessibility and PU.1 transcription factor binding at the signature genes of IL-33RM control their transcriptome reprogramming. Specifically, disrupting PU.1-DNA interaction abolishes the microglial state transition and Aβ clearance that is induced by IL-33. Thus, we define a PU.1-dependent transcriptional pathway that drives the IL-33-induced functional state transition of microglia, resulting in enhanced Aβ clearance.

Abstract: Summary
Manipulating molecules that impact T cell receptor (TCR) or cytokine signaling, such as the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), has significant potential for advancing T cell-based immunotherapies. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how PTPN2 impacts the activation, survival, and memory formation of T cells. We find that PTPN2 deficiency renders cells in vivo and in vitro less dependent on survival-promoting cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15. Remarkably, briefly ex vivo-activated PTPN2-deficient T cells accumulate in 3- to 11-fold higher numbers following transfer into unmanipulated, antigen-free mice. Moreover, the absence of PTPN2 augments the survival of short-lived effector T cells and allows them to robustly re-expand upon secondary challenge. Importantly, we find no evidence for impaired effector function or memory formation. Mechanistically, PTPN2 deficiency causes broad changes in the expression and phosphorylation of T cell expansion and survival-associated proteins. Altogether, our data underline the therapeutic potential of targeting PTPN2 in T cell-based therapies to augment the number and survival capacity of antigen-specific T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging, mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for recent epidemics across the Americas, and it is closely related to dengue virus (DENV). Here, we study samples from 46 DENV-naive and 43 DENV-immune patients with RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection at early-acute, late-acute, and convalescent time points from our pediatric cohort study in Nicaragua. We analyze the samples via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), CyTOF, and multiplex cytokine/chemokine Luminex to generate a comprehensive, innate immune profile during ZIKV infection. Immunophenotyping and analysis of cytokines/chemokines reveal that CD14+ monocytes play a key role during ZIKV infection. Further, we identify CD169 (Siglec-1) on CD14+ monocytes as a potential biomarker of acute ZIKV infection. Strikingly distinct transcriptomic and immunophenotypic signatures are observed at all three time points. Interestingly, pre-existing dengue immunity has minimal impact on the innate immune response to Zika. Finally, this comprehensive immune profiling and network analysis of ZIKV infection in children serves as a valuable resource.

Abstract: Summary
The inactive X chromosome (Xi) is inherently susceptible to genomic aberrations. Replication stress (RS) has been proposed as an underlying cause, but the mechanisms that protect from Xi instability remain unknown. Here, we show that macroH2A1.2, an RS-protective histone variant enriched on the Xi, is required for Xi integrity and female survival. Mechanistically, macroH2A1.2 counteracts its structurally distinct and equally Xi-enriched alternative splice variant, macroH2A1.1. Comparative proteomics identified a role for macroH2A1.1 in alternative end joining (alt-EJ), which accounts for Xi anaphase defects in the absence of macroH2A1.2. Genomic instability was rescued by simultaneous depletion of macroH2A1.1 or alt-EJ factors, and mice deficient for both macroH2A1 variants harbor no overt female defects. Notably, macroH2A1 splice variant imbalance affected alt-EJ capacity also in tumor cells. Together, these findings identify macroH2A1 splicing as a modulator of genome maintenance that ensures Xi integrity and may, more broadly, predict DNA repair outcome in malignant cells.

Abstract: Summary
During organogenesis, coherent organ growth arises from spatiotemporally coordinated decisions of individual cells. In the root of Arabidopsis thaliana, this coordination results in the establishment of a division and a differentiation zone. Cells continuously move through these zones; thus, a major question is how the boundary between these domains, the transition zone, is formed and maintained. By combining molecular genetics with computational modeling, we reveal how an auxin/PLETHORA/ARR-B network controls these dynamic patterning processes. We show that after germination, cell division causes a drop in distal PLT2 levels that enables transition zone formation and ARR12 activation. The resulting PLT2-ARR12 antagonism controls expansion of the division zone (the meristem). The successive ARR1 activation antagonizes PLT2 through inducing the cell-cycle repressor KRP2, thus setting final meristem size. Our work indicates a key role for the interplay between cell division dynamics and regulatory networks in root zonation and transition zone patterning.

Abstract: Summary
The advent of base editors (BEs) holds great potential for correcting pathogenic-related point mutations to treat relevant diseases. However, Cas9 nickase (nCas9)-derived BEs lead to DNA double-strand breaks, which can trigger unwanted DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that the original version of catalytically dead Cas12a (dCas12a)-conjugated BEs induce a basal level of DNA breaks and minimally activate DDR proteins, including H2AX, ATM, ATR, and p53. By fusing dCas12a with engineered human apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3A (APOBEC3A), we further develop the BEACON (base editing induced by human APOBEC3A and Cas12a without DNA break) system to achieve enhanced deamination efficiency and editing specificity. Efficient C-to-T editing is achieved by BEACON in mammalian cells at levels comparable to AncBE4max, with only low levels of DDR and minimal RNA off-target mutations. Importantly, BEACON induces in vivo base editing in mouse embryos, and targeted C-to-T conversions are detected in F0 mice.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms underlying subcellular targeting of cAMP-generating adenylyl cyclases and processes regulated by their compartmentalization are poorly understood. Here, we identify Ankmy2 as a repressor of the Hedgehog pathway via adenylyl cyclase targeting. Ankmy2 binds to multiple adenylyl cyclases, determining their maturation and trafficking to primary cilia. Mice lacking Ankmy2 are mid-embryonic lethal. Knockout embryos have increased Hedgehog signaling and completely open neural tubes showing co-expansion of all ventral neuroprogenitor markers, comparable to the loss of the Hedgehog receptor Patched1. Ventralization in Ankmy2 knockout is completely independent of the Hedgehog pathway transducer Smoothened. Instead, ventralization results from the reduced formation of Gli2 and Gli3 repressors and early depletion of adenylyl cyclase III in neuroepithelial cilia, implicating deficient pathway repression. Ventralization in Ankmy2 knockout requires both cilia and Gli2 activation. These findings indicate that cilia-dependent adenylyl cyclase signaling represses the Hedgehog pathway and promotes morphogenetic patterning.

Abstract: Summary
DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) are among the most common lesions in the genome, arising spontaneously and as intermediates of many DNA transactions. Nevertheless, in contrast to double-strand breaks (DSBs), their distribution in the genome has hardly been addressed in a meaningful way. We now present a technique based on genome-wide ligation of 3′-OH ends followed by sequencing (GLOE-Seq) and an associated computational pipeline designed for capturing SSBs but versatile enough to be applied to any lesion convertible into a free 3′-OH terminus. We demonstrate its applicability to mapping of Okazaki fragments without prior size selection and provide insight into the relative contributions of DNA ligase 1 and ligase 3 to Okazaki fragment maturation in human cells. In addition, our analysis reveals biases and asymmetries in the distribution of spontaneous SSBs in yeast and human chromatin, distinct from the patterns of DSBs.

Abstract: Summary
Medulloblastoma (MB) is a neoplasm linked to dysregulated cerebellar development. Previously, we demonstrated that the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subgroup grows hierarchically, with Sox2+ cells at the apex of tumor progression and relapse. To test whether this mechanism is rooted in a normal developmental process, we studied the role of Sox2 in cerebellar development. We find that the external germinal layer (EGL) is derived from embryonic Sox2+ precursors and that the EGL maintains a rare fraction of Sox2+ cells during the first postnatal week. Through lineage tracing and single-cell analysis, we demonstrate that these Sox2+ cells are within the Atoh1+ lineage, contribute extensively to adult granule neurons, and resemble Sox2+ tumor cells. Critically, constitutive activation of the SHH pathway leads to their aberrant persistence in the EGL and rapid tumor onset. We propose that failure to eliminate this rare but potent developmental population is the tumor initiation mechanism in SHH-subgroup MB.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells, cells of the innate immune system, are found in a steady state poised to respond to activating stimuli. Once stimulated, they rapidly undergo dynamic changes in gene expression to adopt an activated phenotype capable of stimulating immune responses. We find that the microRNA miR-9 is upregulated in both bone marrow-derived DCs and conventional DC1s but not in conventional DC2s following stimulation. miR-9 expression in BMDCs and conventional DC1s promotes enhanced DC activation and function, including the ability to stimulate T cell activation and control tumor growth. We find that miR-9 regulated the expression of several negative regulators of transcription, including the transcriptional repressor Polycomb group factor 6 (Pcgf6). These findings demonstrate that miR-9 facilitates the transition of DCs from steady state to mature state by regulating the expression of several negative regulators of DC function in a cell-type-specific manner.

Abstract: Summary
Most monogenic disorders have a primary clinical presentation. Inherited ISG15 deficiency, however, has manifested with two distinct presentations to date: susceptibility to mycobacterial disease and intracranial calcifications from hypomorphic interferon-II (IFN-II) production and excessive IFN-I response, respectively. Accordingly, these patients were managed for their infectious and neurologic complications. Herein, we describe five new patients with six novel ISG15 mutations presenting with skin lesions who were managed for dermatologic disease. Cellularly, we denote striking specificity to the IFN-I response, which was previously assumed to be universal. In peripheral blood, myeloid cells display the most robust IFN-I signatures. In the affected skin, IFN-I signaling is observed in the keratinocytes of the epidermis, endothelia, and the monocytes and macrophages of the dermis. These findings define the specific cells causing circulating and dermatologic inflammation and expand the clinical spectrum of ISG15 deficiency to dermatologic presentations as a third phenotype co-dominant to the infectious and neurologic manifestations.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in both innate and adaptive immunity. Emerging evidence has demonstrated metabolic reprogramming during DC activation. However, how DC activation is linked with metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Here we show that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), the rate-limiting enzyme in the last step of glycolysis, is critical for LPS-induced DC activation. Upon DC activation, JNK signaling stimulated p300 association with PKM2 for the acetylation of lysine 433, a classic posttranslational modification critical for PKM2 destabilization and nuclear re-localization. Subsequently, nuclear PKM2 partnered with c-Rel to enhance Il12p35 expression, which is important for Th1 cell differentiation. Meanwhile, decreased enzymatic activity of PKM2 due to detetramerization facilitated glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis, helping DCs meet their need for biomacromolecules. Together, we provide evidence for metabolic control of DC activation and offer insights into aberrant immune responses due to dysregulated Th1 functions.

Abstract: Summary
Protein kinases are essential for signal transduction and control of most cellular processes, including metabolism, membrane transport, motility, and cell cycle. Despite the critical role of kinases in cells and their strong association with diseases, good coverage of their interactions is available for only a fraction of the 535 human kinases. Here, we present a comprehensive mass-spectrometry-based analysis of a human kinase interaction network covering more than 300 kinases. The interaction dataset is a high-quality resource with more than 5,000 previously unreported interactions. We extensively characterized the obtained network and were able to identify previously described, as well as predict new, kinase functional associations, including those of the less well-studied kinases PIM3 and protein O-mannose kinase (POMK). Importantly, the presented interaction map is a valuable resource for assisting biomedical studies. We uncover dozens of kinase-disease associations spanning from genetic disorders to complex diseases, including cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Low-grade inflammation is constitutive of atherosclerosis, and anti-inflammatory therapy inhibiting interleukin-1β (IL-1β) reduces the rate of cardiovascular events. While cholesterol accumulation in atheroma plaque and macrophages is a major driver of the inflammatory process, the role of the LXR cholesterol sensors remains to be clarified. Murine and human macrophages were treated with LXR agonists for 48 h before Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Unexpectedly, we observe that, among other cytokines, LXR agonists selectively increase IL1B mRNA levels independently of TLR activation. This effect, restricted to human macrophages, is mediated by activation of HIF-1α through LXR. Accordingly, LXR agonists also potentiate other HIF-1α-dependent pathways, such as glycolysis. Treatment of human macrophages with carotid plaque homogenates also leads to induction of IL1B in an LXR-dependent manner. Thus, our work discloses a mechanism by which cholesterol and oxysterols trigger inflammation in atherosclerosis. This suggests perspectives to target IL-1β production in atherosclerotic patients.

Abstract: Summary
The link between the gut microbiota and type 2 diabetes (T2D) warrants further investigation because of known confounding effects from antidiabetic treatment. Here, we profiled the gut microbiota in a discovery (n = 1,011) and validation (n = 484) cohort comprising Swedish subjects naive for diabetes treatment and grouped by glycemic status. We observed that overall gut microbiota composition was altered in groups with impaired glucose tolerance, combined glucose intolerance and T2D, but not in those with impaired fasting glucose. In addition, the abundance of several butyrate producers and functional potential for butyrate production were decreased both in prediabetes and T2D groups. Multivariate analyses and machine learning microbiome models indicated that insulin resistance was strongly associated with microbial variations. Therefore, our study indicates that the gut microbiota represents an important modifiable factor to consider when developing precision medicine approaches for the prevention and/or delay of T2D.

Abstract: Summary
The human genome encodes millions of regulatory elements, of which only a small fraction are active within a given cell type. Little is known about the global impact of chromatin remodelers on regulatory DNA landscapes and how this translates to gene expression. We use precision genome engineering to reawaken homozygously inactivated SMARCA4, a central ATPase of the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Here, we combine DNase I hypersensitivity, histone modification, and transcriptional profiling to show that SMARCA4 dramatically increases both the number and magnitude of accessible chromatin sites genome-wide, chiefly by unmasking sites of low regulatory factor occupancy. By contrast, transcriptional changes are concentrated within well-demarcated remodeling domains wherein expression of specific genes is gated by both distal element activation and promoter chromatin configuration. Our results provide a perspective on how global chromatin remodeling activity is translated to gene expression via regulatory DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Centrosome separation in late G2/ early prophase requires precise spatial coordination that is determined by a balance of forces promoting and antagonizing separation. The major effector of centrosome separation is the kinesin Eg5. However, the identity and regulation of Eg5-antagonizing forces is less well characterized. By manipulating candidate components, we find that centrosome separation is reversible and that separated centrosomes congress toward a central position underneath the flat nucleus. This positioning mechanism requires microtubule polymerization, as well as actin polymerization. We identify perinuclear actin structures that form in late G2/early prophase and interact with microtubules emanating from the centrosomes. Disrupting these structures by breaking the interactions of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex with perinuclear actin filaments abrogates this centrosome positioning mechanism and causes an increase in subsequent chromosome segregation errors. Our results demonstrate how geometrical cues from the cell nucleus coordinate the orientation of the emanating spindle poles before nuclear envelope breakdown.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of multiple histone acylations diversifies transcriptional control by metabolism, but their functions are incompletely defined. Here we report evidence of histone crotonylation in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. We define the enzymes that regulate crotonylation and show its dynamic control by environmental signals: carbon sources, the short-chain fatty acids butyrate and crotonate, and cell wall stress. Crotonate regulates stress-responsive transcription and rescues C. albicans from cell wall stress, indicating broad impact on cell biology. The YEATS domain crotonylation readers Taf14 and Yaf9 are required for C. albicans virulence, and Taf14 controls gene expression, stress resistance, and invasive growth via its chromatin reader function. Blocking the Taf14 C terminus with a tag reduced virulence, suggesting that inhibiting Taf14 interactions with chromatin regulators impairs function. Our findings shed light on the regulation of histone crotonylation and the functions of the YEATS proteins in eukaryotic pathogen biology and fungal infections.

Abstract: The emergence and perseverance of drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) ensures that drug discovery efforts remain at the forefront of tuberculosis research. There are numerous different approaches that can be employed to lead to the discovery of anti-tubercular agents. In this work, we endeavored to optimize the anthraquinone chemical scaffold of a known drug, rhein, converting it from a compound with negligible activity against Mtb, to a series of compounds with potent activity. Two compounds exhibited low toxicity and good liver microsome stability and were further progressed in attempts to identify the biological target. Whole genome sequencing of resistant isolates revealed inactivating mutations in a monoglyceride lipase. Over-expression trials and an enzyme assay confirmed that the designed compounds are prodrugs, activated by the monoglyceride lipase. We propose that rhein is the active moiety of the novel compounds, which requires chemical modifications to enable access to the cell through the extensive cell wall structure. This work demonstrates that re-engineering of existing antimicrobial agents is a valid method in the development of new anti-tubercular compounds.

Abstract: Summary
Precise control of the RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) cycle, including pausing and pause release, maintains transcriptional homeostasis and organismal functions. Despite previous work to understand individual transcription steps, we reveal a mechanism that integrates RNA Pol II cycle transitions. Surprisingly, KAP1/TRIM28 uses a previously uncharacterized chromatin reader cassette to bind hypo-acetylated histone 4 tails at promoters, guaranteeing continuous progression of RNA Pol II entry to and exit from the pause state. Upon chromatin docking, KAP1 first associates with RNA Pol II and then recruits a pathway-specific transcription factor (SMAD2) in response to cognate ligands, enabling gene-selective CDK9-dependent pause release. This coupling mechanism is exploited by tumor cells to aberrantly sustain transcriptional programs commonly dysregulated in cancer patients. The discovery of a factor integrating transcription steps expands the functional repertoire by which chromatin readers operate and provides mechanistic understanding of transcription regulation, offering alternative therapeutic opportunities to target transcriptional dysregulation.

Abstract: Summary
Zinc finger protein St18 was initially reported as candidate tumor suppressor gene, and also suggested that fibroblast St18 positively regulates NF-κB activation. Despite the pleiotropic functions of St18, little is known about its roles in macrophages. Here, we report that myeloid St18 is a potent inhibitor of VEGF-A. Mice lacking St18 in myeloid lineages exhibit increased retinal vasculature with enhanced serum VEGF-A concentrations. Despite the normal activation of NF-κB target genes, these mice are highly susceptible to LPS-induced shock, polymicrobial sepsis, and experimental colitis, accompanied by enhanced vascular and intestinal leakage. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF signaling rescued the high mortality rate of myeloid-specific St18-deficient mice in response to inflammation. Mechanistically, St18 directly binds to Sp1 and attenuates its activity, leading to the suppression of Sp1 target gene VEGF-A. Using mouse genetic and pharmacological models, we reveal myeloid St18 as a critical septic death protector.

Abstract: Summary
The human immune system varies extensively between individuals, but variation within individuals over time has not been well characterized. Systems-level analyses allow for simultaneous quantification of many interacting immune system components and the inference of global regulatory principles. Here, we present a longitudinal, systems-level analysis in 99 healthy adults 50 to 65 years of age and sampled every third month for 1 year. We describe the structure of interindividual variation and characterize extreme phenotypes along a principal curve. From coordinated measurement fluctuations, we infer relationships between 115 immune cell populations and 750 plasma proteins constituting the blood immune system. While most individuals have stable immune systems, the degree of longitudinal variability is an individual feature. The most variable individuals, in the absence of overt infections, exhibited differences in markers of metabolic health suggestive of a possible link between metabolic and immunologic homeostatic regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) body is a phase-separated nuclear structure physically associated with chromatin, implying its crucial roles in genome functions. However, its role in transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. We developed APEX-mediated chromatin labeling and purification (ALaP) to identify the genomic regions proximal to PML bodies. We found that PML bodies associate with active regulatory regions across the genome and with ∼300 kb of the short arm of the Y chromosome (YS300) in mouse embryonic stem cells. The PML body association with YS300 is essential for the transcriptional activity of the neighboring Y-linked clustered genes. Mechanistically, PML bodies provide specific nuclear spaces that the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A cannot access, resulting in the steady maintenance of a hypo-methylated state at Y-linked gene promoters. Our study underscores a new mechanism for gene regulation in the 3D nuclear space and provides insights into the functional properties of nuclear structures for genome function.

Gametophytic Abortion in Heterozygotes but Not in Homozygotes: Implied Chromosome Rearrangement during T-DNA ertion at the ASF1 Locus in Arabidopsis,

Abstract: T-DNA insertional mutations in Arabidopsis genes have conferred huge benefits to the research community, greatly facilitating gene function analyses. However, the insertion process can cause chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we show an example of a likely rearrangement following T-DNA insertion in the Anti-Silencing Function 1B (ASF1B) gene locus on Arabidopsis chromosome 5, so that the phenotype was not relevant to the gene of interest, ASF1B. ASF1 is a histone H3/H4 chaperone involved in chromatin remodeling in the sporophyte and during reproduction. Plants that were homozygous for mutant alleles asf1a or asf1b were developmentally normal. However, following self-fertilization of double heterozygotes (ASF1A/asf1a ASF1B/asf1b, hereafter AaBb), defects were visible in both male and female gametes. Half of the AaBb and aaBb ovules displayed arrested embryo sacs with functional megaspore identity. Similarly, half of the AaBb and aaBb pollen grains showed centromere defects, resulting in pollen abortion at the bi-cellular stage of the male gametophyte. However, inheritance of the mutant allele in a given gamete did not solely determine the abortion phenotype. Introducing functional ASF1B failed to rescue the AaBb- and aaBb- mediated abortion, suggesting that heterozygosity in the ASF1B gene causes gametophytic defects, rather than the loss of ASF1. The presence of reproductive defects in heterozygous mutants but not in homozygotes, and the characteristic all-or-nothing pollen viability within tetrads, were both indicative of commonly-observed T-DNA-mediated translocation activity for this allele. Our observations reinforce the importance of complementation tests in assigning gene function using reverse genetics.

Abstract: Summary
Age is a non-modifiable risk factor for the inflammation that underlies age-associated diseases; thus, anti-inflammaging drugs hold promise for increasing health span. Cytokine profiling and bioinformatic analyses showed that Th17 cytokine production differentiates CD4+ T cells from lean, normoglycemic older and younger subjects, and mimics a diabetes-associated Th17 profile. T cells from older compared to younger subjects also had defects in autophagy and mitochondrial bioenergetics that associate with redox imbalance. Metformin ameliorated the Th17 inflammaging profile by increasing autophagy and improving mitochondrial bioenergetics. By contrast, autophagy-targeting siRNA disrupted redox balance in T cells from young subjects and activated the Th17 profile by activating the Th17 master regulator, STAT3, which in turn bound IL-17A and F promoters. Mitophagy-targeting siRNA failed to activate the Th17 profile. We conclude that metformin improves autophagy and mitochondrial function largely in parallel to ameliorate a newly defined inflammaging profile that echoes inflammation in diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Glutamate receptor auxiliary proteins control receptor distribution and function, ultimately controlling synapse assembly, maturation, and plasticity. At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a synapse with both pre- and postsynaptic kainate-type glutamate receptors (KARs), we show that the auxiliary protein Neto evolved functionally distinct isoforms to modulate synapse development and homeostasis. Using genetics, cell biology, and electrophysiology, we demonstrate that Neto-α functions on both sides of the NMJ. In muscle, Neto-α limits the size of the postsynaptic receptor field. In motor neurons (MNs), Neto-α controls neurotransmitter release in a KAR-dependent manner. In addition, Neto-α is both required and sufficient for the presynaptic increase in neurotransmitter release in response to reduced postsynaptic sensitivity. This KAR-independent function of Neto-α is involved in activity-induced cytomatrix remodeling. We propose that Drosophila ensures NMJ functionality by acquiring two Neto isoforms with differential expression patterns and activities.

Abstract: Summary
Teeth are attached to alveolar bone by the periodontal ligament (PDL), which contains stem cells supporting tissue turnover. Here, we identified Gli1+ cells in adult mouse molar PDL as multi-potential stem cells (PDLSCs) giving rise to PDL, alveolar bone, and cementum. They support periodontium tissue turnover and injury repair. Gli1+ PDLSCs are surrounding the neurovascular bundle and more enriched in the apical region. Canonical Wnt signaling is essential for their activation. Alveolar bone osteocytes negatively regulate Gli1+ PDLSCs activity through sclerostin, a Wnt inhibitor. Blockage of sclerostin accelerates the PDLSCs lineage contribution rate in vivo. Sclerostin expression is modulated by physiological occlusal force. Removal of occlusal force upregulates sclerostin and inhibits PDLSCs activation. In summary, Gli1+ cells are the multipotential PDLSCs in vivo. Osteocytes provide negative feedback to PDLSCs and inhibit their activities through sclerostin. Physiological occlusal force indirectly regulates PDLSCs activities by fine-tuning this feedback loop.

Abstract: Summary
Despite much progress toward understanding how epithelial morphogenesis is shaped by intra-epithelial processes including contractility, polarity, and adhesion, much less is known regarding how such cellular processes are coordinated by extra-epithelial signaling. During embryogenesis, the coelomic epithelia on the two sides of the chick embryo undergo symmetrical lengthening and thinning, converging medially to generate and position the dorsal mesentery (DM) in the embryonic midline. We find that Hedgehog signaling, acting through downstream effectors Sec5 (ExoC2), an exocyst complex component, and RhoU (Wrch-1), a small GTPase, regulates coelomic epithelium morphogenesis to guide DM midline positioning. These effects are accompanied by changes in epithelial cell-cell alignment and N-cadherin and laminin distribution, suggesting Hedgehog regulation of cell organization within the coelomic epithelium. These results indicate a role for Hedgehog signaling in regulating epithelial morphology and provide an example of how transcellular signaling can modulate specific cellular processes to shape tissue morphogenesis.

Sr-HA scaffolds fabricated by SPS technology promote the repair of segmental bone defects,

Abstract: Background
Ideal bone defect repair scaffolds should be biodegradable, biocompatible, bioactive, porous, and provide adequate mechanical support. However, it is challenging to fabricate such an ideal bone repair scaffold. Previously, we showed that 5 wt.% strontium-doped hydroxyapatite (Sr-HA) scaffolds prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technology exhibited good biocompatibility. Moreover, unlike pure hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffolds, HA scaffolds containing strontium (Sr) exhibited superior bioactivity, higher proliferation rate of BMSCs and MG-63 osteoblast cells, as well as enhanced BMSCs differentiation.
Methods
In this study, we prepared pure HA scaffolds and 5 wt.% strontium containing Sr-HA scaffolds by SPS technology without adhesive, ammonium bicarbonate as pore former. Subsequently, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the properties of Sr-HA and HA scaffolds. The ability of the scaffolds to repair bone defects was evaluated using a critical-sized rabbit tibia-bone defect rabbit model. Thirty 3-month-old New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into three groups (blank control group, Sr-HA scaffolds implanted group and HA scaffolds implanted group) with 10 rabbits in each group. These rabbits are sacrificed after 8 weeks and 16 weeks of surgery, and the repair effects of each scaffold were evaluated with X-ray, micro-CT, and HE staining. The three-point bending test was employed to assess the mechanical property of repaired bones.
Results
XRD pattern indicated that Sr-HA and HA scaffolds possess a similar crystal structure after sintering, and that incorporation of strontium did not form impure phase. SEM showed that the porosity of Sr-HA and HA scaffolds was about 40 %. Universal Testing Machine tests showed that Sr-HA scaffolds had better compressive strength than HA scaffolds. Bone defect was obvious, and the fibrous tissue was formed in the bone defects of rabbits in the blank control group after 8 weeks of surgery. Sr-HA and HA scaffolds enhanced osteointegration of the host bone, and extensive woven bone was formed on the surface of the Sr-HA scaffolds. After 16 weeks, the bone strump became blunt and a small amount of callus was formed in the blank control group. Comparatively, the scaffolds were substantially degraded in the Sr-HA scaffolds implanted group while scaffolds shadows still were observed in the HA implanted group. Bone remodeling and cavity recanalization were completely developed in the Sr-HA scaffolds group. The compressive strength of repaired bone in the Sr-HA scaffolds implantation group was higher than that of HA scaffolds implantation group after 8 weeks and 16 weeks of surgery.
Conclusions
Our results show that the Sr-HA composite scaffolds can effectively repair bone defects and have good biodegradable properties.

Abstract: Summary
Better understanding of the progression of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the developing cerebral cortex is important for modeling neurogenesis and defining the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we use RNA sequencing, cell imaging, and lineage tracing of mouse and human in vitro NSCs and monkey brain sections to model the generation of cortical neuronal fates. We show that conserved signaling mechanisms regulate the acute transition from proliferative NSCs to committed glutamatergic excitatory neurons. As human telencephalic NSCs develop from pluripotency in vitro, they transition through organizer states that spatially pattern the cortex before generating glutamatergic precursor fates. NSCs derived from multiple human pluripotent lines vary in these early patterning states, leading differentially to dorsal or ventral telencephalic fates. This work furthers systematic analyses of the earliest patterning events that generate the major neuronal trajectories of the human telencephalon.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine tumor treated clinically as a single disease with poor outcomes. Distinct SCLC molecular subtypes have been defined based on expression of ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, or YAP1. Here, we use mouse and human models with a time-series single-cell transcriptome analysis to reveal that MYC drives dynamic evolution of SCLC subtypes. In neuroendocrine cells, MYC activates Notch to dedifferentiate tumor cells, promoting a temporal shift in SCLC from ASCL1+ to NEUROD1+ to YAP1+ states. MYC alternatively promotes POU2F3+ tumors from a distinct cell type. Human SCLC exhibits intratumoral subtype heterogeneity, suggesting that this dynamic evolution occurs in patient tumors. These findings suggest that genetics, cell of origin, and tumor cell plasticity determine SCLC subtype.

Abstract: Summary
Cocaine drastically elevates dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum, a brain region that is critical to the psychomotor and rewarding properties of the drug. DA signaling regulates intrastriatal circuits connecting medium spiny neurons (MSNs) with afferent fibers and interneurons. While the cocaine-mediated increase in DA signaling on MSNs is well documented, that on cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) has been more difficult to assess. Using combined pharmacological, chemogenetic, and cell-specific ablation approaches, we reveal that the D2R-dependent inhibition of acetylcholine (ACh) signaling is fundamental to cocaine-induced changes in behavior and the striatal genomic response. We show that the D2R-dependent control of striatal ChIs enables the motor, sensitized, and reinforcing properties of cocaine. This study highlights the importance of the DA- and D2R-mediated inhibitory control of ChIs activity in the normal functioning of striatal networks.

Abstract: Summary
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) represents the leading cause of airway infection in cystic fibrosis (CF). Early airways colonization can be explained by enhanced adhesion of Pa to the respiratory epithelium. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on fully differentiated primary cultures of airway epithelial cells from CF and non-CF donors predict that VAV3, β1 INTEGRIN, and FIBRONECTIN genes are significantly enriched in CF. Indeed, Vav3 is apically overexpressed in CF, associates with active β1 integrin luminally exposed, and increases fibronectin deposition. These luminal microdomains, rich in fibronectin and β1 integrin and regulated by Vav3, mediate the increased Pa adhesion to the CF epithelium. Interestingly, Vav3 inhibition normalizes the CF-dependent fibronectin and β1-integrin ectopic expression, improves the CF epithelial integrity, and prevents the enhanced Pa trapping to the CF epithelium. Through its capacity to promote a luminal complex with active β1 integrin and fibronectin that favors bacteria trapping, Vav3 may represent a new target in CF.

Abstract: Summary
The enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri forces its uptake into non-phagocytic host cells through the translocation of T3SS effectors that subvert the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we report de novo actin polymerization after cellular entry around the bacterium-containing vacuole (BCV) leading to the formation of a dynamic actin cocoon. This cocoon is thicker than any described cellular actin structure and functions as a gatekeeper for the cytosolic access of the pathogen. Host CDC42, TOCA-1, N-WASP, WIP, the Arp2/3 complex, cortactin, coronin, and cofilin are recruited to the actin cocoon. They are subverted by T3SS effectors, such as IpgD, IpgB1, and IcsB. IcsB immobilizes components of the actin polymerization machinery at the BCV dependent on its fatty acyltransferase activity. This represents a unique microbial subversion strategy through localized entrapment of host actin regulators causing massive actin assembly.

Abstract: Summary
The first cultivated representative of the enigmatic phylum Saccharibacteria (formerly TM7) was isolated from humans and revealed an ultra-small cell size (200–300 nm), a reduced genome with limited biosynthetic capabilities, and a unique parasitic lifestyle. TM7x was the only cultivated member of the candidate phyla radiation (CPR), estimated to encompass 26% of the domain Bacteria. Here we report on divergent genomes from major lineages across the Saccharibacteria phylum in humans and mammals, as well as from ancient dental calculus. These lineages are present at high prevalence within hosts. Direct imaging reveals that all groups are ultra-small in size, likely feeding off commensal bacteria. Analyses suggest that multiple acquisition events in the past led to the current wide diversity, with convergent evolution of key functions allowing Saccharibacteria from the environment to adapt to mammals. Ultra-small, parasitic CPR bacteria represent a relatively unexplored paradigm of prokaryotic interactions within mammalian microbiomes.

Abstract: Summary
We evaluated ancestry effects on mutation rates, DNA methylation, and mRNA and miRNA expression among 10,678 patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We demonstrated that cancer subtypes and ancestry-related technical artifacts are important confounders that have been insufficiently accounted for. Once accounted for, ancestry-associated differences spanned all molecular features and hundreds of genes. Biologically significant differences were usually tissue specific but not specific to cancer. However, admixture and pathway analyses suggested some of these differences are causally related to cancer. Specific findings included increased FBXW7 mutations in patients of African origin, decreased VHL and PBRM1 mutations in renal cancer patients of African origin, and decreased immune activity in bladder cancer patients of East Asian origin.

Abstract: Summary
Generating robust CD4+ T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) responses is essential for protective vaccine-induced type 1 immunity. Here, we examine whether immunization formulation associated with enhanced vaccine efficacy promotes antigen targeting and cell recruitment into lymph node (LN) niches associated with optimal type 1 responses. Immunization with antigen and Toll-like receptor agonist emulsified in oil leads to an increased differentiation of IFNγ/TNF-α+ polyfunctional Th1 cells compared to an identical immunization in saline. Oil immunization results in a rapid delivery and persistence of antigen in interfollicular regions (IFRs) of the LN, whereas without oil, antigen is distributed in the medullary region. Following oil immunization, CXCL10-producing inflammatory monocytes accumulate in the IFR, which mobilizes antigen-specific CD4+ T cells into this niche. In this microenvironment, CD4+ T cells are advantageously positioned to encounter arriving IL-12-producing inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs). These data suggest that formulations delivering antigen to the LN IFR create an inflammatory niche that can improve vaccine efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Studying posttranslational modifications classically relies on experimental strategies that oversimplify the complex biosynthetic machineries of living cells. Protein glycosylation contributes to essential biological processes, but correlating glycan structure, underlying protein, and disease-relevant biosynthetic regulation is currently elusive. Here, we engineer living cells to tag glycans with editable chemical functionalities while providing information on biosynthesis, physiological context, and glycan fine structure. We introduce a non-natural substrate biosynthetic pathway and use engineered glycosyltransferases to incorporate chemically tagged sugars into the cell surface glycome of the living cell. We apply the strategy to a particularly redundant yet disease-relevant human glycosyltransferase family, the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases. This approach bestows a gain-of-chemical-functionality modification on cells, where the products of individual glycosyltransferases can be selectively characterized or manipulated to understand glycan contribution to major physiological processes.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathways protect cells from toxicity caused by incomplete protein products resulting from translation of damaged or problematic mRNAs. Extensive work in yeast has identified highly conserved mechanisms that lead to degradation of faulty mRNA and partially synthesized polypeptides. Here we used CRISPR-Cas9-based screening to search for additional RQC strategies in mammals. We found that failed translation leads to specific inhibition of translation initiation on that message. This negative feedback loop is mediated by two translation inhibitors, GIGYF2 and 4EHP. Model substrates and growth-based assays established that inhibition of additional rounds of translation acts in concert with known RQC pathways to prevent buildup of toxic proteins. Inability to block translation of faulty mRNAs and subsequent accumulation of partially synthesized polypeptides could explain the neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders observed in mice and humans with compromised GIGYF2 function.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) enables essential metabolic reactions; nonetheless, the cellular responses to defects in mitochondria and the modulation of signaling pathway outputs are not understood. We show that Notch signaling and ETC attenuation via knockdown of COX7a induces massive over-proliferation. The tumor-like growth is caused by a transcriptional response through the eIF2α-kinase PERK and ATF4, which activates the expression of metabolic enzymes, nutrient transporters, and mitochondrial chaperones. We find this stress adaptation to be beneficial for progenitor cell fitness, as it renders cells sensitive to proliferation induced by the Notch signaling pathway. Intriguingly, over-proliferation is not caused by transcriptional cooperation of Notch and ATF4, but it is mediated in part by pH changes resulting from the Warburg metabolism induced by ETC attenuation. Our results suggest that ETC function is monitored by the PERK-ATF4 pathway, which can be hijacked by growth-promoting signaling pathways, leading to oncogenic pathway activity.

Abstract: Summary
Correct functioning of chondrocytes is crucial for long bone growth and fracture repair. These cells are highly anabolic but survive and function in an avascular environment, implying specific metabolic requirements that are, however, poorly characterized. Here, we show that chondrocyte identity and function are closely linked with glutamine metabolism in a feedforward process. The master chondrogenic transcription factor SOX9 stimulates glutamine metabolism by increasing glutamine consumption and levels of glutaminase 1 (GLS1), a rate-controlling enzyme in this pathway. Consecutively, GLS1 action is critical for chondrocyte properties and function via a tripartite mechanism. First, glutamine controls chondrogenic gene expression epigenetically through glutamate dehydrogenase-dependent acetyl-CoA synthesis, necessary for histone acetylation. Second, transaminase-mediated aspartate synthesis supports chondrocyte proliferation and matrix synthesis. Third, glutamine-derived glutathione synthesis avoids harmful reactive oxygen species accumulation and allows chondrocyte survival in the avascular growth plate. Collectively, our study identifies glutamine as a metabolic regulator of cartilage fitness during bone development.

Abstract: About 20 %–35 % of mandibular fractures occur in the condylar process, a complication frequently associated with craniofacial traumas. Compared to other craniofacial fractures, some controversy remains around the effectiveness of the various treatment methods. It has been suggested that condylar osteosynthesis using mini-plates – a technique widely used by maxillofacial surgeons – may activate a pro-inflammatory response which is mediated by interleukins, later involved in bone remodelling and tissue regeneration. This study aimed at examining the influence of three-dimensional (3D) titanium mini-plate systems and the dedicated screws used in the surgical treatment of condylar fractions on the concentrations of interleukin 1(IL-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in macrophages obtained from THP-1 monocytes. The cells were cultured for 24 h and 48 h with the 3D titanium condylar plates and dedicated screws (Synthes, Martin, Medartis manufacturer). The concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 were measured using the ELISA method. Incubation of macrophages with plates did not cause a significant increase in IL-1 (for: Synthes 0.89−0.86 pg/mg protein; Martin 1.10−0.80 pg/mg protein; Medartis 1.20−0.84 pg/mg protein) and IL-6 (for Synthes 16.00−14.00 pg/mg protein, Martin 13.0−10.0 pg/mg protein; Medartis 9.0–12.0 pg/mg protein) expression for any of the plates used, compared to THP-1 macrophages incubated for 48 h under control conditions. Neither three-dimensional titanium mini-plates nor dedicated screws caused any changes in IL-1 and IL-6 expression in THP-1 macrophages, which is an important observation for clinicians treating condylar fractures. It confirms that titanium plates can be a safe/neutral material for humans, especially considering their significant influence on the osteoclast functions and bone remodelling processes after implantation.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterial cell wall is made of peptidoglycan (PG), a polymer that is essential for the maintenance of cell shape and survival. During growth, bacteria remodel their PG, releasing fragments that are predominantly re-internalized and recycled. Here, we show that Vibrio cholerae recycles PG fragments modified with non-canonical d-amino acids (NCDAA), which lead to the accumulation of cytosolic PG tetrapeptides. We demonstrate that the accumulation of recycled tetrapeptides has two regulatory consequences for the cell wall: reduction of d,d-cross-linkage and reduction of PG synthesis. We further demonstrate that l,d-carboxypeptidases from five different species show a preferential activity for substrates containing canonical (d-alanine) versus non-canonical (d-methionine) d-amino acids, suggesting that the accumulation of intracellular tetrapeptides in NCDAA-rich environments is widespread. Collectively, this work reveals a regulatory role of NCDAA linking PG recycling and synthesis to promote optimal cell wall assembly and composition in the stationary phase.

Abstract: Summary
Previous studies have suggested that the loss of the translation initiation factor eIF4G1 homolog NAT1 induces excessive self-renewability of naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs); yet the role of NAT1 in the self-renewal and differentiation of primed PSCs is still unclear. Here, we generate a conditional knockout of NAT1 in primed PSCs and use the cells for the functional analyses of NAT1. Our results show that NAT1 is required for the self-renewal and neural differentiation of primed PSCs. In contrast, NAT1 deficiency in naive pluripotency attenuates the differentiation to all cell types. We also find that NAT1 is involved in efficient protein expression of an RNA uridyltransferase, TUT7. TUT7 is involved in the neural differentiation of primed PSCs via the regulation of human endogenous retrovirus accumulation. These data demonstrate the essential roles of NAT1 and TUT7 in the precise transition of stem cell fate.

Abstract: Nuclear receptor subfamily group H member 4 (NR1H4), also known as farnesoid X receptor, has been implicated in several cellular processes in the liver and intestine. Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested a role of NR1H4 in colon cancer development; however, how NR1H4 regulates colon cancer cell growth and survival remains unclear. We generated NR1H4 knockout (KO) colon cancer cells using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (CAS9) technology and explored the effects of NR1H4 KO in colon cancer cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. Interestingly, NR1H4 KO cells showed impaired cell proliferation, reduced colony formation, and increased apoptotic cell death compared to control colon cancer cells. We identified MYC as an important mediator of the signaling pathway alterations induced by NR1H4 KO. NR1H4 silencing in colon cancer cells resulted in reduced MYC protein levels, while NR1H4 activation using an NR1H4 ligand, chenodeoxycholic acid, resulted in time- and dose-dependent MYC induction. Moreover, NR1H4 KO enhanced the anti-cancer effects of doxorubicin and cisplatin, supporting the role of MYC in the enhanced apoptosis observed in NR1H4 KO cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that modulating NR1H4 activity in colon cancer cells might be a promising alternative approach to treat cancer using MYC-targeting agents.

Abstract: Summary
The shortage of donor lungs hinders lung transplantation, the only definitive option for patients with end-stage lung disease. Blastocyst complementation enables the generation of transplantable organs from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in animal models. Pancreases and kidneys have been generated from PSCs by blastocyst complementation in rodent models. Here, we report the generation of lungs using mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in apneumic Fgf10 Ex1mut/Ex3mut mice by blastocyst complementation. Complementation with ESCs enables Fgf10-deficient mice to survive to adulthood without abnormalities. Both the generated lung alveolar parenchyma and the interstitial portions, including vascular endothelial cells, vascular and parabronchial smooth muscle cells, and connective tissue, largely originate from the injected ESCs. These data suggest that Fgf10 Ex1mut/Ex3mut blastocysts provide an organ niche for lung generation and that blastocyst complementation could be a viable approach for generating whole lungs.

Abstract: Summary
Steroid receptors activate gene transcription by recruiting coactivators to initiate transcription of their target genes. For most nuclear receptors, the ligand-dependent activation function domain-2 (AF-2) is a primary contributor to the nuclear receptor (NR) transcriptional activity. In contrast to other steroid receptors, such as ERα, the activation function of androgen receptor (AR) is largely dependent on its ligand-independent AF-1 located in its N-terminal domain (NTD). It remains unclear why AR utilizes a different AF domain from other receptors despite that NRs share similar domain organizations. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of DNA-bound full-length AR and its complex structure with key coactivators, SRC-3 and p300. AR dimerization follows a unique head-to-head and tail-to-tail manner. Unlike ERα, AR directly contacts a single SRC-3 and p300. The AR NTD is the primary site for coactivator recruitment. The structures provide a basis for understanding assembly of the AR:coactivator complex and its domain contributions for coactivator assembly and transcriptional regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is activated by prolonged fasting but cannot overcome the ensuing hepatic lipid overload, resulting in fatty liver. Here, we describe a peroxisome-lysosome metabolic link that restricts autophagic degradation of lipids. Acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in peroxisomal β-oxidation, is enriched in liver and further increases with fasting or high-fat diet (HFD). Liver-specific Acox1 knockout (Acox1-LKO) protected mice against hepatic steatosis caused by starvation or HFD due to induction of autophagic degradation of lipid droplets. Hepatic Acox1 deficiency markedly lowered total cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels, which led to decreased Raptor acetylation and reduced lysosomal localization of mTOR, resulting in impaired activation of mTORC1, a central regulator of autophagy. Dichloroacetic acid treatment elevated acetyl-CoA levels, restored mTORC1 activation, inhibited autophagy, and increased hepatic triglycerides in Acox1-LKO mice. These results identify peroxisome-derived acetyl-CoA as a key metabolic regulator of autophagy that controls hepatic lipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Replication-blocking DNA lesions are particularly toxic to proliferating cells because they can lead to chromosome mis-segregation if not repaired prior to mitosis. In this study, we report that ZGRF1 null cells accumulate chromosome aberrations following replication perturbation and show sensitivity to two potent replication-blocking anticancer drugs: mitomycin C and camptothecin. Moreover, ZGRF1 null cells are defective in catalyzing DNA damage-induced sister chromatid exchange despite accumulating excessive FANCD2, RAD51, and γ-H2AX foci upon induction of interstrand DNA crosslinks. Consistent with a direct role in promoting recombinational DNA repair, we show that ZGRF1 is a 5′-to-3′ helicase that catalyzes D-loop dissociation and Holliday junction branch migration. Moreover, ZGRF1 physically interacts with RAD51 and stimulates strand exchange catalyzed by RAD51-RAD54. On the basis of these data, we propose that ZGRF1 promotes repair of replication-blocking DNA lesions through stimulation of homologous recombination.

Abstract: Summary
Biomolecular condensates play a key role in organizing RNAs and proteins into membraneless organelles. Bacterial RNP-bodies (BR-bodies) are a biomolecular condensate containing the RNA degradosome mRNA decay machinery, but the biochemical function of such organization remains poorly defined. Here, we define the RNA substrates of BR-bodies through enrichment of the bodies followed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We find that long, poorly translated mRNAs, small RNAs, and antisense RNAs are the main substrates, while rRNA, tRNA, and other conserved non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are excluded from these bodies. BR-bodies stimulate the mRNA decay rate of enriched mRNAs, helping to reshape the cellular mRNA pool. We also observe that BR-body formation promotes complete mRNA decay, avoiding the buildup of toxic endo-cleaved mRNA decay intermediates. The combined selective permeability of BR-bodies for both enzymes and substrates together with the stimulation of the sub-steps of mRNA decay provide an effective organization strategy for bacterial mRNA decay.

Abstract: Summary
Infant mortality from dengue disease is a devastating global health burden that could be minimized with the ability to identify susceptibility for severe disease prior to infection. Although most primary infant dengue infections are asymptomatic, maternally derived anti-dengue immunoglobulin G (IgGs) present during infection can trigger progression to severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement mechanisms. Importantly, specific characteristics of maternal IgGs that herald progression to severe infant dengue are unknown. Here, we define ≥10% afucosylation of maternal anti-dengue IgGs as a risk factor for susceptibility of infants to symptomatic dengue infections. Mechanistic experiments show that afucosylation of anti-dengue IgGs promotes FcγRIIIa signaling during infection, in turn enhancing dengue virus replication in FcγRIIIa+ monocytes. These studies identify a post-translational modification of anti-dengue IgGs that correlates with risk for symptomatic infant dengue infections and define a mechanism by which afucosylated antibodies and FcγRIIIa enhance dengue infections.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes are associated with increased cancer incidence. Here, we show that hyperinsulinemia promotes epithelial tumorigenesis by abrogating cell competition. In Drosophila eye imaginal epithelium, oncogenic scribble (scrib) mutant cells are eliminated by cell competition when surrounded by wild-type cells. Through a genetic screen, we find that flies heterozygous for the insulin receptor substrate chico allow scrib cells to evade cell competition and develop into tumors. Intriguingly, chico is required in the brain’s insulin-producing cells (IPCs) to execute cell competition remotely. Mechanistically, chico downregulation in IPCs causes hyperinsulinemia by upregulating a Drosophila insulin Dilp2, which activates insulin-mTOR signaling and thus boosts protein synthesis in scrib cells. A diet-induced increase in insulin levels also triggers scrib tumorigenesis, and pharmacological repression of protein synthesis prevents hyperinsulinemia-induced scrib overgrowth. Our findings provide an in vivo mechanistic link between metabolic disease and cancer risk via systemic regulation of cell competition.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is an inevitable process that involves profound physiological changes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in various biological processes but are not systemically studied in aging. To provide an organism-wide lncRNA landscape during aging, we conduct comprehensive RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses across the mouse lifespan. Of the 1,675 aging-regulated lncRNAs (AR-lncRNAs) identified, the majority are connected to inflammation-related biological pathways. AR-lncRNAs exhibit high tissue specificity; conversely, those with higher tissue specificity are preferentially regulated during aging. White adipose tissue (WAT) displays the highest number of AR-lncRNAs and develops the most dynamic crosstalk between AR-lncRNA and AR-mRNA during aging. An adipose-enriched AR-lncRNA, lnc-adipoAR1, is negatively correlated with aging, and knocking it down inhibits adipogenesis, phenocopying the compromised adipogenic capacity of aged fat. Our works together reveal AR-lncRNAs as essential components in aging and suggest that although each tissue ages in a distinct manner, WAT is a leading contributor to aging-related health decline.

Abstract: Summary
Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes are essential for genome organization from bacteria to humans, but their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize human SMC complexes condensin I and II and unveil the architecture of the human condensin II complex, revealing two putative DNA-entrapment sites. Using single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that both condensin I and II exhibit ATP-dependent motor activity and promote extensive and reversible compaction of double-stranded DNA. Nucleosomes are incorporated into DNA loops during compaction without being displaced from the DNA, indicating that condensin complexes can readily act upon nucleosome-bound DNA molecules. These observations shed light on critical processes involved in genome organization in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Neonatally transplanted human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) can myelinate the brains of myelin-deficient shiverer mice, rescuing their phenotype and survival. Yet, it has been unclear whether implanted hGPCs are similarly able to remyelinate the diffusely demyelinated adult CNS. We, therefore, ask if hGPCs could remyelinate both congenitally hypomyelinated adult shiverers and normal adult mice after cuprizone demyelination. In adult shiverers, hGPCs broadly disperse and differentiate as myelinating oligodendrocytes after subcortical injection, improving both host callosal conduction and ambulation. Implanted hGPCs similarly remyelinate denuded axons after cuprizone demyelination, whether delivered before or after demyelination. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of hGPCs back from cuprizone-demyelinated brains reveals their transcriptional activation of oligodendrocyte differentiation programs, while distinguishing them from hGPCs not previously exposed to demyelination. These data indicate the ability of transplanted hGPCs to disperse throughout the adult CNS, to broadly myelinate regions of dysmyelination, and also to be recruited as myelinogenic oligodendrocytes later in life, upon demyelination-associated demand.

Abstract: Summary
We present a consensus atlas of the human brain transcriptome in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), based on meta-analysis of differential gene expression in 2,114 postmortem samples. We discover 30 brain coexpression modules from seven regions as the major source of AD transcriptional perturbations. We next examine overlap with 251 brain differentially expressed gene sets from mouse models of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Human-mouse overlaps highlight responses to amyloid versus tau pathology and reveal age- and sex-dependent expression signatures for disease progression. Human coexpression modules enriched for neuronal and/or microglial genes broadly overlap with mouse models of AD, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and aging. Other human coexpression modules, including those implicated in proteostasis, are not activated in AD models but rather following other, unexpected genetic manipulations. Our results comprise a cross-species resource, highlighting transcriptional networks altered by human brain pathophysiology and identifying correspondences with mouse models for AD preclinical studies.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is overexpressed in several types of cancer, suggesting an additional function beyond its established role in the glycolytic pathway. We here report that PGAM1 is overexpressed in gliomas where it increases the efficiency of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway by cytoplasmic binding of WIP1 phosphatase, thereby preventing WIP1 nuclear translocation and subsequent dephosphorylation of the ATM signaling pathway. Silencing of PGAM1 expression in glioma cells consequently decreases formation of γ-H2AX foci, increases apoptosis, and decreases clonogenicity following irradiation (IR) and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. Furthermore, mice intracranially implanted with PGAM1-knockdown cells have significantly improved survival after treatment with IR and TMZ. These effects are counteracted by exogenous expression of two kinase-dead PGAM1 mutants, H186R and Y92F, indicating an important non-enzymatic function of PGAM1. Our findings identify PGAM1 as a potential therapeutic target in gliomas.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, alters RNA sequences from those encoded by DNA. These editing events are dynamically regulated, but few trans regulators of ADARs are known in vivo. Here, we screen RNA-binding proteins for roles in editing regulation with knockdown experiments in the Drosophila brain. We identify zinc-finger protein at 72D (Zn72D) as a regulator of editing levels at a majority of editing sites in the brain. Zn72D both regulates ADAR protein levels and interacts with ADAR in an RNA-dependent fashion, and similar to ADAR, Zn72D is necessary to maintain proper neuromuscular junction architecture and fly mobility. Furthermore, Zn72D’s regulatory role in RNA editing is conserved because the mammalian homolog of Zn72D, Zfr, regulates editing in mouse primary neurons. The broad and conserved regulation of ADAR editing by Zn72D in neurons sustains critically important editing events.

Nonstructural NS5A Protein Regulates LIM and SH3 Domain Protein 1 to Promote Hepatitis C Virus Propagation,

Abstract: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) propagation is highly dependent on cellular proteins. To identify the host factors involved in HCV propagation, we previously performed protein microarray assays and identified the LIM and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP-1) as an HCV NS5A-interacting partner. LASP-1 plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and protein-protein interactions. Alteration of LASP-1 expression has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the functional involvement of LASP1 in HCV propagation and HCV-induced pathogenesis has not been elucidated. Here, we first verified the protein interaction of NS5A and LASP-1 by both in vitro pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays. We further showed that NS5A and LASP-1 were colocalized in the cytoplasm of HCV infected cells. NS5A interacted with LASP-1 through the proline motif in domain I of NS5A and the tryptophan residue in the SH3 domain of LASP-1. Knockdown of LASP-1 increased HCV replication in both HCV-infected cells and HCV subgenomic replicon cells. LASP-1 negatively regulated viral propagation and thereby overexpression of LASP-1 decreased HCV replication. Moreover, HCV propagation was decreased by wild-type LASP-1 but not by an NS5A binding-defective mutant of LASP-1. We further demonstrated that LASP-1 was involved in the replication stage of the HCV life cycle. Importantly, LASP-1 expression levels were increased in persistently infected cells with HCV. These data suggest that HCV modulates LASP-1 via NS5A in order to regulate virion levels and maintain a persistent infection.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive targeted therapy resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are poorly understood. Here, we identify SETD5 as a major driver of PDAC resistance to MEK1/2 inhibition (MEKi). SETD5 is induced by MEKi resistance and its deletion restores refractory PDAC vulnerability to MEKi therapy in mouse models and patient-derived xenografts. SETD5 lacks histone methyltransferase activity but scaffolds a co-repressor complex, including HDAC3 and G9a. Gene silencing by the SETD5 complex regulates known drug resistance pathways to reprogram cellular responses to MEKi. Pharmacological co-targeting of MEK1/2, HDAC3, and G9a sustains PDAC tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Our work uncovers SETD5 as a key mediator of acquired MEKi therapy resistance in PDAC and suggests a context for advancing MEKi use in the clinic.

Abstract: Summary
B cell receptor (BCR) engagement induces naive B cells to differentiate and perform critical immune-regulatory functions. Acquisition of functional specificity requires that a cell survive, enter the cell cycle, and proliferate. We establish that quantitatively distinct Ca2+ signals triggered by variations in the extent of BCR engagement dynamically regulate these transitions by controlling nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), NFAT, and mTORC1 activity. Weak BCR engagement induces apoptosis by failing to activate NF-κB-driven anti-apoptotic gene expression. Stronger signals that trigger more robust Ca2+ signals promote NF-κB-dependent survival and NFAT-, mTORC1-, and c-Myc-dependent cell-cycle entry and proliferation. Finally, we establish that CD40 or TLR9 costimulation circumvents these Ca2+-regulated checkpoints of B cell activation and proliferation. As altered BCR signaling is linked to autoimmunity and B cell malignancies, these results have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of aberrant B cell activation and differentiation and therapeutic approaches to target these responses.

Abstract: Summary
The cohesin- and condensin-related SMC5/6 complex has largely been studied in the context of DNA repair. Nevertheless, SMC5/6 has an undefined essential function even in the absence of cellular stress. Through the use of an auxin-inducible degradation system for rapidly depleting subunits of the SMC5/6 complex, we show that SMC5/6 is essential for viability in cancer-derived and normal human cells. Impairment of SMC5/6 function is associated with spontaneous induction of DNA damage, p53 activation, cell-cycle arrest, and senescence, as well as an increased frequency of various mitotic chromosome segregation abnormalities. However, we show that this chromosome missegregation is apparent only when SMC5/6 function is impaired during the preceding S and G2 phases. In contrast, degradation of SMC5/6 immediately prior to mitotic entry has little or no impact on the fidelity of chromosome segregation, highlighting the importance of the complex during interphase in order to ensure faithful sister chromatid disjunction.

Abstract: Na,K-ATPase is a ubiquitous multifunctional protein that acts both as an ion pump and as a signal transducer. The signaling function is activated by ouabain in non-toxic concentrations. In epithelial cells the ouabain-bound Na,K-ATPase connects with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor via a short linear motif to activate low frequency Ca2+ oscillations. Within a couple of minutes this ouabain mediated signal has resulted in phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of 2580 phospho-sites. Proteins that control cell proliferation and cell adhesion and calmodulin regulated proteins are enriched among the ouabain phosphor-regulated proteins. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and the stromal interaction molecule, which are both essential for the initiation of Ca2+ oscillations, belong to the ouabain phosphor-regulated proteins. Downstream effects of the ouabain-evoked Ca2+ signal in epithelial cells include interference with the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic process and stimulation of embryonic growth processes. The dual function of Na,K-ATPase as an ion pump and a signal transducer is now well established and evaluation of the physiological and pathophysiological consequences of this universal signal emerges as an urgent topic for future studies.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian mRNA nuclear export process is thought to terminate at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex through ribonucleoprotein remodeling. We conduct a stringent affinity-purification mass-spectrometry-based screen of the physical interactions of human RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligases. The resulting protein-interaction network reveals interactions between the RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase MKRN2 and GLE1, a DEAD-box helicase activator implicated in mRNA export termination. We assess MKRN2 epistasis with GLE1 in a zebrafish model. Morpholino-mediated knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout of MKRN2 partially rescue retinal developmental defects seen upon GLE1 depletion, consistent with a functional association between GLE1 and MKRN2. Using ribonomic approaches, we show that MKRN2 binds selectively to the 3′ UTR of a diverse subset of mRNAs and that nuclear export of MKRN2-associated mRNAs is enhanced upon knockdown of MKRN2. Taken together, we suggest that MKRN2 interacts with GLE1 to selectively regulate mRNA nuclear export and retinal development.

Abstract: Objectives
The search for new TB drugs has become one of the great challenges for modern medicinal chemistry. An improvement in the outcomes of TB chemotherapy can be achieved by the development of new, shorter, cheap, safe and effective anti-TB regimens.
Methods
Chalcones (1a-1o) were synthesized and evaluated for their antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium bovis BCG using growth inhibition assays. Compound 1a was selected as a ‘hit’ compound. The mode of action of compound 1a, was identified by mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMEs) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) analysis using thin layer chromatography. Dose dependent experiments were conducted by over-expressing components of FAS-II in M. bovis BCG to confirm the target. Ligand binding using intrinsic tryptophan assay and molecular docking were used to further validate the target.
Results
MAMEs and FAMEs analysis showed dose-dependent reduction of MAMEs with the overall abundance of FAMEs suggesting that compound 1a targets mycolic acid biosynthesis. Direct binding of 1a to InhA was observed using an intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence binding assay, and a 2-fold IC50 shift was observed with an InhA overexpressing strain confirming InhA as the cellular target.
Conclusion
The chalcone 1a exhibits potent antimycobacterial activity, displays a good safety profile and is a direct inhibitor of InhA, a key component in mycolic acid synthesis, validating this series for further anti-TB drug development.

Abstract: Summary
The diversity and heterogeneity within high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), which is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, is not well understood. Here, we perform comprehensive multi-platform omics analyses, including integrated analysis, and immune monitoring on primary and metastatic sites from highly clinically annotated HGSC samples based on a laparoscopic triage algorithm from patients who underwent complete gross resection (R0) or received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with excellent or poor response. We identify significant distinct molecular abnormalities and cellular changes and immune cell repertoire alterations between the groups, including a higher rate of NF1 copy number loss, and reduced chromothripsis-like patterns, higher levels of strong-binding neoantigens, and a higher number of infiltrated T cells in the R0 versus the NACT groups.
