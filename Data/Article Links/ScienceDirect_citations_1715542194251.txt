Abstract: Fiducial-based correlation of fluorescence and electron microscopy data from high-pressure frozen and resin-embedded samples allows for high-precision localization of fluorescent signals to subcellular ultrastructure. Here we introduce the triCLEM procedure to facilitate the identification of very rare events for high-precision correlation. We present a detailed protocol to screen high-pressure frozen cell monolayers on sapphire disks for very rare signals by cryo-fluorescence microscopy, relocate the cells of interest after freeze substitution and Lowicryl embedding, and perform fiducial-based correlation of the identified fluorescent signals to high-magnification electron tomograms. We show the applicability of the protocol to localize and image damaged mitochondria marked by the presence of Parkin, a protein involved in initiating mitophagy. We discuss how this extension to previously published fiducial-based correlation procedures has potential to both allow identifying very rare events and assess the quality of preservation in high-pressure frozen samples.

Abstract: CTP synthase (CTPS) can aggregate into an intracellular macrostructure, the cytoophidium, in various organisms including human cells. Previous studies have shown that assembly of human CTPS cytoophidia may be correlated with the cellular metabolic status, and is able to promote the activity of CTPS. A correlation between the cytoophidium and cancer metabolism has been proposed but not yet been revealed. In the current study we provide clear evidence of the presence of CTPS cytoophidia in various human cancers and some non-cancerous tissues. Moreover, among 203 tissue samples of hepatocellular carcinoma, 56 (28%) samples exhibited many cytoophidia, whereas no cytoophidia were detected in adjacent non-cancerous hepatocytes for all samples. Our findings suggest that the CTPS cytoophidium may participate in the adaptive metabolism of human hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: Hypothermia (HT) is a well-established neuroprotective strategy against neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). The overexpression of heat shock proteins (HSP) has been shown to provide neuroprotection in animal models of stroke. We aimed to investigate the effect of HT on HSP70 and HSP27 expression in a neonatal rat model of HIE. Seven-day-old rat pups were exposed to hypoxia for 90 min to establish the Rice-Vannucci model and were assigned to the following four groups: hypoxic injury (HI)-normothermia (NT, 36 °C), HI-HT (30 °C), sham-NT, and sham-HT. After temperature intervention for 24 h, the mRNA and protein expression of HSP70 and HSP27 were measured. The association between HSP expression and brain injury severity was also evaluated. The brain infarct size was significantly smaller in the HI-HT group than in the HI-NT group. The mRNA and protein expression of both HSPs were significantly greater in the two HI groups, compared to those in the two sham groups. Moreover, among the rat pups subjected to HI, HT significantly reduced the mRNA and protein expression of both HSPs. The mRNA expression level of the HSPs was proportional to the brain injury severity. Post-ischemic HT, i.e., a cold shock attenuated the expression of HSP70 and HSP27 in a neonatal rat model of HIE. Our study suggests that neither HSP70 nor HSP27 expression is involved in the neuroprotective mechanism through which prolonged HT protects against neonatal HIE.

Abstract: Chemotherapy resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are being targeted as a modern therapeutic approach to prevent disease relapse. LSCs isolated from methotrexate resistant side population (SP) of leukemic cell lines HL60 and MOLT4 exhibited high levels of CD25 and TRAIL R2/DR5 which are potential targets. Recombinant immunotoxin conjugating IL2α with TRAIL peptide mimetic was constructed for DR5 receptor specific targeting of LSCs and were tested in total cell population and LSCs. IL2-TRAIL peptide induced apoptosis in drug resistant SP cells from cell lines and showed potent cytotoxicity in PBMCs derived from leukemic patients with an efficacy of 81.25% in AML and 100% in CML, ALL and CLL. IL2-TRAIL peptide showed cytotoxicity in relapsed patient samples and was more effective than TRAIL or IL2-TRAIL proteins. Additionally, DR5 specific IL2-TRAIL peptide was effective in targeting and killing LSCs purified from cell lines [IC50: 952nM in HL60, 714nM in MOLT4] and relapsed patient blood samples with higher efficacy (85%) than IL2-TRAIL protein (46%). Hence, CD25 and DR5 specific targeting by IL2-TRAIL peptide may be an effective strategy for targeting drug resistant leukemic cells and LSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The guanidine-II (mini-ykkC) riboswitch is the smallest of the guanidine-responsive riboswitches, comprising two stem loops of similar sequence. We have solved high-resolution crystal structures of both stem loops for the riboswitch from Gloeobacter violaceus. The stem loops have a strong propensity to dimerize by intimate loop-loop interaction. The dimerization creates specific binding pockets for two guanidine molecules, explaining their cooperative binding. Within the binding pockets the ligands are hydrogen bonded to a guanine at O6 and N7, and to successive backbone phosphates. Additionally they are each stacked upon a guanine nucleobase. One side of the pocket has an opening to the solvent, slightly lowering the specificity of ligand binding, and structures with bound methylguanidine, aminoguanidine, and agmatine show how this is possible.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence shows that extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) exert their therapeutic effects in several disease models. We previously demonstrated that MSCs suppress autoimmunity in models of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Therefore, here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived EVs using our established mouse models for autoimmune diseases affecting the pancreas and the eye: T1D and EAU. The data demonstrate that MSC-derived EVs effectively prevent the onset of disease in both T1D and EAU. In addition, the mixed lymphocyte reaction assay with MSC-derived EVs indicated that EVs inhibit activation of antigen-presenting cells and suppress development of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells. These results raise the possibility that MSC-derived EVs may be an alternative to cell therapy for autoimmune disease prevention.

Abstract: Summary
The application of spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) transplantation for regenerating male fertility requires amplification of SSC number in vitro during which the integrity to re-establish spermatogenesis must be preserved. Conventional conditions supporting proliferation of SSCs from mouse pups have been the basis for developing methodology with adult human cells but are unrefined. We found that the integrity to regenerate spermatogenesis after transplantation declines with advancing time in primary cultures of pup SSCs and that the efficacy of deriving cultures from adult SSCs is limited with conventional conditions. To address these deficiencies, we optimized the culture environment to favor glycolysis as the primary bioenergetics process. In these conditions, regenerative integrity of pup and adult SSCs was significantly improved and the efficiency of establishing primary cultures was 100%. Collectively, these findings suggest that SSCs are primed for conditions favoring glycolytic activity, and matching culture environments to their bioenergetics is critical for maintaining functional integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) deficient for microRNAs (miRNAs), such as Dgcr8−/− or Dicer−/– embryonic stem cells (ESCs), contain no mature miRNA and cannot differentiate into somatic cells. How miRNA deficiency causes differentiation defects remains poorly understood. Here, we report that miR-302 is sufficient to enable neural differentiation of differentiation-incompetent Dgcr8−/− ESCs. Our data showed that miR-302 directly suppresses the tumor suppressor p53, which is modestly upregulated in Dgcr8−/− ESCs and serves as a barrier restricting neural differentiation. We demonstrated that direct inactivation of p53 by SV40 large T antigen, a short hairpin RNA against Trp53, or genetic ablation of Trp53 in Dgcr8−/− PSCs enables neural differentiation, while activation of p53 by the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a in wild-type ESCs inhibits neural differentiation. Together, we demonstrate that a major function of miRNAs in neural differentiation is suppression of p53 and that modest activation of p53 blocks neural differentiation of miRNA-deficient PSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Acquired genomic instability is one of the major concerns for the clinical use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). All reprogramming methods are accompanied by the induction of DNA damage, of which double-strand breaks are the most cytotoxic and mutagenic. Consequently, DNA repair genes seem to be relevant for accurate reprogramming to minimize the impact of such DNA damage. Here, we reveal that reprogramming is associated with high levels of DNA end resection, a critical step in homologous recombination. Moreover, the resection factor CtIP is essential for cell reprogramming and establishment of iPSCs, probably to repair reprogramming-induced DNA damage. Our data reveal a new role for DNA end resection in maintaining genomic stability during cell reprogramming, allowing DNA repair fidelity to be retained in both human and mouse iPSCs. Moreover, we demonstrate that reprogramming in a resection-defective environment has long-term consequences on stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.

Abstract: Benzyl alcohol (BnOH) is widely used as a component of foods, cosmetics, household products and medical products. It is generally considered to be safe for human use, however, it has been connected to a number of adverse effects, including hypersensitivity reactions and neonatal deaths. BnOH is a membrane fluidizing agent that can affect membrane protein activity and cellular processes such as ligand binding to cell surface receptors, endocytosis and degradation of lysosomal cargo. In this study, we examined the effects of BnOH on intracellular transport using Shiga toxin (Stx), diphtheria toxin (DT) and ricin. BnOH caused reduced toxicity of all three toxins at BnOH concentrations that cause membrane fluidization. The reduced toxicity of Stx and ricin was mainly due to inhibition of retrograde transport between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network as BnOH had small effects on cell association and endocytosis of ricin and Stx. Strikingly, BnOH also induced a reversible fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus.

Abstract: Signal transduction through the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) pathway affects epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), partly by modulation of E-Cadherin expression. The concurrent impact of extracellular matrix driven regulation of integrin signaling on EMT has not been well characterized. We assessed the cumulative effect and molecular mechanisms of TGF-β1 and integrin signal transduction on E-Cadherin in a renal cell cancer (RCC) model. Stimulation of RCC cells with TGF-β1 demonstrated a three-fold increased expression of integrin αv. A ligand of integrin αv-β3, (cyclopentapeptide containing Arginyl-Glycyl-Aspartic acid motif, RGD), was used to mimic integrin signaling. Treatment of cells with RGD and TGF-β1 demonstrated significantly greater E-cadherin depletion than either ligand alone. This cooperative action on E-Cadherin expression is regulated by transcription factor Snai1 and is followed on a cellular level by increased cellular mobility as evidenced in a wound healing assay. Subsequent silencing of potential downstream mediators of the cumulative action of RGD and TGF-β1 was carried out by small interfering RNA transfection and confirmed by Western blotting and/or RT-PCR. SiRNA mediated silencing of FAK and PINCH1 independently abrogated the cumulative effect of RGD and TGF-β1 on E-Cadherin expression. We have identified a novel mechanism through which extracellular matrix event transduction by integrins further augments TGF-β1 related effects on EMT. Molecular machinery involved in the integrin αv-TGF-β1 interplay may represent a therapeutic target in RCC.

Abstract: Summary
The bone size and quality, acquired during adolescent growth under the influence of anabolic hormones, growth factors, and nutrients, determine the height and bone stability and forecast osteoporosis risks in late life. Yet bone size and quality control mechanisms remain enigmatic. To study the roles of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, sensor of growth factors and nutrients, in bone size and quality regulation, we ablated Tsc1, a suppressor of mTOR, in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), monocytes, or their progenies osteoblasts and osteoclasts. mTOR activation in MSCs, but much less in osteoblasts, increased bone width and mass due to MSC hyperproliferation, but decreased bone length and mineral contents due to defective MSC differentiation. mTOR activation promotes bone mineral accretion by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and activity directly or via coupling with MSCs. Tuberous sclerosis complex patient studies confirmed these findings. Thus, mTOR regulates bone size via MSCs and bone quality by suppressing catabolic activities of osteoclasts.

Abstract: Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) is a powerful tool to perform ultrastructural analysis of targeted tissues or cells. The large field of view of the light microscope (LM) enables quick and efficient surveys of the whole specimen. It is also compatible with live imaging, giving access to functional assays. CLEM protocols take advantage of the features to efficiently retrace the position of targeted sites when switching from one modality to the other. They more often rely on anatomical cues that are visible both by light and electron microscopy. We present here a simple workflow where multicellular specimens are embedded in minimal amounts of resin, exposing their surface topology that can be imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). LM and SEM both benefit from a large field of view that can cover whole model organisms. As a result, targeting specific anatomic locations by focused ion beam–SEM (FIB-SEM) tomography becomes straightforward. We illustrate this application on three different model organisms, used in our laboratory: the zebrafish embryo Danio rerio, the marine worm Platynereis dumerilii, and the dauer larva of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we focus on the experimental steps to reduce the amount of resin covering the samples and to image the specimens inside an FIB-SEM. We expect this approach to have widespread applications for volume electron microscopy on multiple model organisms.

Abstract: It remains unclear what cells are proper for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) is well known as a tissue stem cell and progenitor marker, both of which are reported to be sensitive to reprogramming. In the present study, we examined the reprogramming behavior of Lgr5-expressing cells (Lgr5+ cells). First, we compared reprogramming behavior using mouse Lgr5+ and Lgr5 negative (Lgr5−) hair follicles (HFs). The number of alkaline phosphatase staining-positive cells was lesser in a well of Lgr5+ HFs than in Lgr5− HFs; however, the ratio of Nanog+ SSEA1+ cells in the cell mixture derived from Lgr5+ HFs was much higher than that from Lgr5− HFs. Lgr5+ cells could be induced from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) after transduction with Yamanaka factors. As shown in HFs, the progeny of Lgr5+ cells arising from MEFs highly converted into Nanog+ cells and did not form Nanog− colonies. The progeny represented the status of the late reprogramming phase to a higher degree than the nonprogeny. We also confirmed this using human Lg5+ cells. Our findings suggest that the use of Lgr5+ cells will minimize sorting efforts for obtaining superior iPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Pyroptosis is a lytic form of programmed cell death mediated by the inflammatory caspase-1, -4, and -5. We recently discovered that small-molecule inhibitors of the serine peptidases DPP8 and DPP9 (DPP8/9) induce pro-caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis in monocytes and macrophages. Notably, DPP8/9 inhibitors, unlike microbial agents, absolutely require caspase-1 to induce cell death. Therefore, DPP8/9 inhibitors are useful probes to study caspase-1 in cells. Here, we show that, in the absence of the pyroptosis-mediating substrate gasdermin D (GSDMD), caspase-1 activates caspase-3 and -7 and induces apoptosis, demonstrating that GSDMD is the only caspase-1 substrate that induces pyroptosis. Conversely, we found that, during apoptosis, caspase-3/-7 specifically block pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMD at a distinct site from the inflammatory caspases that inactivates the protein. Overall, this work reveals bidirectional crosstalk between apoptosis and pyroptosis in monocytes and macrophages, further illuminating the complex interplay between cell death pathways in the innate immune system.

Abstract: We aimed at analyzing the effect of the 3D-arrangement on the expression of some genes and proteins which play a key role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression in HPAF-II, HPAC and PL45 PDAC cells cultured in either 2D-monolayers or 3D-spheroids. Cytokeratins 7, 8, 18, 19 were differently expressed in 3D-spheroids compared to 2D-monolayers. Syndecan 1 was upregulated in HPAF-II and PL45 3D-spheroids, and downregulated in HPAC. Heparanase mRNA levels were almost unchanged in HPAF-II, and increased in HPAC and PL45 3D-spheroids. Hyaluronan synthase (HAS) 2 and 3 mRNA increased in all 3D-spheroids compared to 2D-monolayers. CD44 and CD44s were expressed to a lower extent in HPAF-II and HPAC 3D-spheroids. By contrast, the CD44s/v3 and the CD44s/v6 ratio increased in HPAC and PL45 3D-spheroids, compared to 2D-monolayers. The expression of MMP-7 was strongly upregulated in 3D-spheroids. STAT3 was similarly expressed 3D-spheroids or 2D-monolayers, while pSTAT3 was almost undetectable in 2D-monolayers and strongly upregulated in 3D-spheroids. These results suggest that 3D-spheroids represent a cell culture model that allows the characterization of PDAC cell phenotype, adding new information that contributes to a better understanding of the biology and behavior of PDAC cells.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial pathogens use invasion into human cells as a strategy to escape not only the host's immune response, but also anti-bacterial treatment. This often leads to persistence and enables reinitiation of the infection process at a later time point. Here, we show that a family of myxobacterial metabolites, disorazoles, block invasion of group A Streptococcus (GAS) into human epithelial cells. Mechanistically, disorazoles target ezrin, a host protein involved in linking microfilaments to the membrane, and affect invasion most likely by interfering with dynamic phosphorylation of ezrin. Overall, our study suggests ezrin as a new factor in two different GAS invasion pathways, independent of the already known CD44 pathway, and that disorazoles are promising “pathoblocker” compounds aimed at this additional invasion mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Multipotent human central nervous system-derived neural stem cells transplanted at doses ranging from 10,000 (low) to 500,000 (very high) cells differentiated predominantly into the oligodendroglial lineage. However, while the number of engrafted cells increased linearly in relationship to increasing dose, the proportion of oligodendrocytic cells declined. Increasing dose resulted in a plateau of engraftment, enhanced neuronal differentiation, and increased distal migration caudal to the transplantation sites. Dose had no effect on terminal sensory recovery or open-field locomotor scores. However, total human cell number and decreased oligodendroglial proportion were correlated with hindlimb girdle coupling errors. Conversely, greater oligodendroglial proportion was correlated with increased Ab step pattern, decreased swing speed, and increased paw intensity, consistent with improved recovery. These data suggest that transplant dose, and/or target niche parameters can regulate donor cell engraftment, differentiation/maturation, and lineage-specific migration profiles.

Abstract: Summary
Recognition of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA by the cytosolic sensor cGAS initiates STING-dependent innate antiviral responses. HCMV can antagonize host immune responses to promote latency infection. However, it is unknown whether and how HCMV targets the cGAS-STING axis for immune evasion. Here we identified the HCMV tegument protein UL82 as a negative regulator of STING-dependent antiviral responses. UL82 interacted with STING and impaired STING-mediated signaling via two mechanisms. UL82 inhibited the translocation of STING from the ER to perinuclear microsomes by disrupting the STING-iRhom2-TRAPβ translocation complex. UL82 also impaired the recruitment of TBK1 and IRF3 to the STING complex. The levels of downstream antiviral genes induced by UL82-deficient HCMV were higher than those induced by wild-type HCMV. Conversely, wild-type HCMV replicated more efficiently than the UL82-deficient mutant. These findings reveal an important mechanism of immune evasion by HCMV.

Abstract: Summary
Calreticulin, a multifunctional endoplasmic reticulum resident protein, is required for TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and subsequent cardiomyogenesis. Using embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from calreticulin-null and wild-type (WT) embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we show that expression of EMT and cardiac differentiation markers is induced during differentiation of WT EBs. This induction is inhibited in the absence of calreticulin and can be mimicked by inhibiting TGF-β signaling in WT cells. The presence of calreticulin in WT cells permits TGF-β-mediated signaling via AKT/GSK3β and promotes repression of E-cadherin by SNAIL2/SLUG. This is paralleled by induction of N-cadherin in a process known as the cadherin switch. We show that regulated Ca2+ signaling between calreticulin and calcineurin is critical for the unabated TGF-β signaling that is necessary for the exit from pluripotency and the cadherin switch during EMT. Calreticulin is thus a key mediator of TGF-β-induced commencement of cardiomyogenesis in mouse ESCs.

Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests a possible relationship between mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and sarcoma. MSCs are hypothesized to be the cells initiating sarcomagenesis, and cancer stem cells (CSCs) sharing features of MSCs have been identified in sarcomas. Here, we report on the characteristics of a bone marrow-derived rat mesenchymal stem cell line that spontaneously transformed in long-term culture. The rat transformed mesenchymal stem cells (rTMSCs) produced soft-tissue fibrosarcomas in immunocompromised mice and immunocompetent rats. In vitro, the rTMSCs displayed increased proliferation capacity compared to the untransformed cell line. The transformed MSCs maintained the mesenchymal phenotype by expression of the stem cell marker CD 90 and the lack of hematopoietic and endothelial markers. Cytogenetic analysis detected trisomy 6 in the rTMSCs. Side population (SP) isolation and tumorsphere cultivation of the transformed cells confirmed the presence of CSCs among the rTMSCs. Importantly, the rTMSCs retained their differentiation capacity towards osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. This transformed MSC-based cell line may be valuable in examining the balance in a mixed cell population between cancer stem cell properties and the ability to differentiate to specific non-transformed cell populations. Moreover, it may also be a useful tool to evaluate the efficacy of novel targeted immunotherapies in vivo.

Abstract: Mechanical properties of cells are known to be influenced by the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, the action of drugs that interact with the actin cortex is investigated by tether extraction and rheology experiments using optical tweezers. The influences of Blebbistatin, Cytochalasin D and Jasplakinolide on the cell mechanical properties are evaluated. The results, in contradiction to current views for Jasplakinolide, show that all three drugs and treatments destabilize the actin cytoskeleton, decreasing the cell membrane tension. The cell membrane bending modulus increased when the actin cytoskeleton was disorganized by Cytochalasin D. This effect was not observed for Blebbistatin and Jasplakinolide. All drugs decreased by two-fold the cell viscoelastic moduli, but only Cytochalasin D was able to alter the actin network into a more fluid-like structure. The results can be interpreted as the interplay between the actin network and the distribution of myosins as actin cross-linkers in the cytoskeleton. This information may contribute to a better understanding of how the membrane and cytoskeleton are involved in cell mechanical properties, underlining the role that each one plays in these properties.

Abstract: Bombesin receptor-activated protein (BRAP) is highly expressed in human bronchial epithelial cells. Recent studies have shown that BRAP reduces oxidative stress, inhibits airway inflammation and suppresses nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) activity. Mucus overproduction is an important feature in patients with chronic inflammatory airway diseases. Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a potent inducer of mucin5AC (MUC5AC), which is considered the predominant mucin secreted by human airway epithelial cells. Here, we hypothesize that BRAP may regulate NE-induced MUC5AC hypersecretion in a bronchial epithelial cell line (HBE16). We also investigated the underlying mechanism involved in the process. In this study, we found that BRAP was present in HBE16 human bronchial epithelial cells and was significantly increased by NE. Next, we found that the up-regulation of BRAP by pEGFP-N1-BRAP caused a significant decrease in the increased levels of MUC5AC expression, NF-κB activity, and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induced by NE. Meanwhile, there was a significant decrease in ROS, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels when BRAP was up-regulated by pEGFP-N1-BRAP. Moreover, when cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1-BRAP and pretreated with NF-κB, ERK or EGFR inhibitors before the NE stimulation, there were further decreased in MUC5AC expression, NF-κB activity, and the phosphorylation of ERK and EGFR. These results suggest that BRAP plays an important role in airway inflammation and its overexpression may regulate NE-induced MUC5AC hypersecretion in HBE16 cells via the EGFR/ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway.

Abstract: Necrotizing enterocolitis is a common but serious complication among premature babies. Currently, there are limited treatment options. These include intensive supportive care and surgical intervention. In this study, we hypothesize that erythropoietin (Epo) could be protective against cell necrosis by increasing the levels of glutathione. This can be regulated by increasing the activity of system xC-. This was demonstrated using intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) as a model system. S4-CPG and sulfasalazine pharmacologically inhibit xCT, which induced cell death. Our data showed a dose dependent decrease in cell viability when treated with both inhibitors. In addition, the IEC-6 cells displayed a dose dependent increase when treated with Epo. In conclusion, Epo can be protective against cell death and ultimately be considered as a treatment option for intestinal epithelial cell death.

Abstract: Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Integrins, overexpressed in cancer, are involved in various processes that favor the development of the disease. This study focused on determining the degree of involvement of α5, α6 and β3 integrin subunits in the establishment/development of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), such as proliferation, migration, invasion, and response to carboplatin. The translation of the α5, α6 and β3 integrins was blocked using morpholines, generating morphant cells for these proteins, which were corroborated by immunofluorescence assays. WST-1 proliferation assay showed that silencing of α5, α6, and β3 integrins does not affect the survival of morphants. Wound healing and transwell chamber assays showed that blocking α5 and α6 integrins decrease, in lesser and greater level respectively, the migratory and the invasive capacity of SKOV-3 cells. Finally, blocking α5 and α6 integrins partially sensitized the cells response to carboplatin, while blocking integrin β3 generated resistance to this drug. Statistical analyses were performed with the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software employing one way and two-way ANOVA tests; data are shown as average±SD. Results suggest that α5 and α6 integrins could become good candidates for chemotherapy targets in EOC.

Abstract: Summary
The monobactams, exemplified by the natural product sulfazecin, are the only class of β-lactam antibiotics not inactivated by metallo-β-lactamases, which confer bacteria with extended-spectrum β-lactam resistance. We screened a transposon mutagenesis library from Pseudomonas acidophila ATCC 31363 and isolated a sulfazecin-deficient mutant that revealed a gene cluster encoding two non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), a methyltransferase, a sulfotransferase, and a dioxygenase. Three modules and an aberrant C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain are distributed across the two NRPSs. Biochemical examination of the adenylation (A) domains provided evidence that L-2,3-diaminopropionate, not L-serine as previously thought, is the direct source of the β-lactam ring of sulfazecin. ATP/PPi exchange assay also revealed an unusual substrate selectivity shift of one A domain when expressed with or without the immediately upstream condensation domain. Gene inactivation analysis defined a cluster of 13 open reading frames sufficient for sulfazecin production, precursor synthesis, self-resistance, and regulation. The identification of a key intermediate supported a proposed NRPS-mediated mechanism of sulfazecin biosynthesis and β-lactam ring formation distinct from the nocardicins, another NRPS-derived subclass of monocyclic β-lactam. These findings will serve as the basis for further biosynthetic research and potential engineering of these important antibiotics.

Abstract: In atmospheric scanning electron microscope (ASEM), the inverted scanning electron microscope (SEM) observes the wet sample from below, while an optical microscope observes it from above simultaneously. The ASEM sample holder has a disposable dish shape with a silicon nitride film window at the bottom. It can be coated variously for the primary-culture of substrate-sensitive cells; primary cells were cultured in a few milliliters of culture medium in a stable incubator environment. For the inverted SEM observation, cells and the excised tissue blocks were aldehyde-fixed, immersed in radical scavenger solution, and observed at minimum electron dose. Neural networking, axonal segmentation, proplatelet-formation and phagocytosis, and Fas expression in embryonic stem cells were captured by optical or fluorescence microscopy, and imaged at high resolution by gold-labeled immuno-ASEM with/without metal staining. By exploiting optical microscopy, the region of interest of organ can be found from the wide area, and the cells and organelle were successfully examined at high resolution by the following scanning electron microscopy. We successfully visualized islet of Langerhans, blood microvessels, neuronal endplate, and bacterial flora on stomach epidermal surfaces. Bacterial biofilms and the typical structural features including “leg complex” of mycoplasma were visualized by exploiting CLEM of ASEM. Based on these studies, ASEM correlative microscopy promises to allow the research of various mesoscopic-scale biological phenomena in the near future.

Abstract: Summary
During nephrogenesis, stem/progenitor cells differentiate and give rise to early nephron structures that segment to proximal and distal nephron cell types. Previously, we prospectively isolated progenitors from human fetal kidney (hFK) utilizing a combination of surface markers. However, upon culture nephron progenitors differentiated and could not be robustly maintained in vitro. Here, by culturing hFK in a modified medium used for in vitro growth of mouse nephron progenitors, and by dissection of NCAM+/CD133− progenitor cells according to EpCAM expression (NCAM+/CD133−/EpCAM−, NCAM+/CD133−/EpCAMdim, NCAM+/CD133−/EpCAMbright), we show at single-cell resolution a preservation of uninduced and induced cap mesenchyme as well as a transitioning mesenchymal-epithelial state. Concomitantly, differentiating and differentiated epithelial lineages are also maintained. In vitro expansion of discrete stages of early human nephrogenesis in nephron stem cell cultures may be used for drug screening on a full repertoire of developing kidney cells and for prospective isolation of mesenchymal or epithelial renal lineages for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
The bladder urothelium functions as a urine-blood barrier and consists of basal, intermediate, and superficial cell populations. Reconstructive procedures such as augmentation cystoplasty and focal mucosal resection involve localized surgical damage to the bladder wall whereby focal segments of the urothelium and underlying submucosa are respectively removed or replaced and regeneration ensues. We demonstrate using lineage-tracing systems that urothelial regeneration following augmentation cystoplasty with acellular grafts exclusively depends on host keratin 5-expressing basal cells to repopulate all lineages of the de novo urothelium at implant sites. Conversely, repair of focal mucosal defects not only employs this mechanism, but in parallel host intermediate cell daughters expressing uroplakin 2 give rise to themselves and are also contributors to superficial cells in neotissues. These results highlight the diversity of urothelial regenerative responses to surgical injury and may lead to advancements in bladder tissue engineering approaches.

Abstract: Summary
To discover small molecules that modulate hematopoietic cell homing after adoptive transfer, we created a transgenic zebrafish expressing firefly luciferase downstream of the ubiquitin promoter (ubi:luc) to serve as a hematopoietic donor. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was used to detect and follow ubi:luc hematopoietic cells that homed to the marrow as early as 1 day post-transplant. BLI was able to detect the biological effect of prostaglandin E2 on early homing/engraftment of donor hematopoietic cells. This system was utilized in a functional screen of small molecules to enhance homing/engraftment. We discovered a phytosterol, ergosterol, that could increase hematopoietic cell homing in zebrafish and mice. In addition, ergosterol increased CXCR4 expression and promoted expansion of Lin−SCA-1+KIT+ cells in vitro. We have demonstrated the utility of in vivo BLI to non-invasively monitor donor hematopoietic cell activity in adult zebrafish as a functional screen for mediators of cellular homing.

Abstract: Combining in vivo imaging with electron microscopy (EM) uniquely allows monitoring rare and critical events in living tissue, followed by their high-resolution visualization in their native context. A major hurdle, however, is to keep track of the region of interest (ROI) when moving from intravital microscopy (IVM) to EM. Here, we present a workflow that relies on correlating IVM and microscopic X-ray computed tomography to predict the position of the ROI inside the EM-processed sample. The ROI can then be accurately and quickly targeted using ultramicrotomy and imaged using EM. We outline how this procedure is used to retrieve and image tumor cells arrested in the vasculature of the mouse brain.

Abstract: Summary
Comparative analyses of the human microbiome have identified both taxonomic and functional shifts that are associated with numerous diseases. To date, however, microbiome taxonomy and function have mostly been studied independently and the taxonomic drivers of functional imbalances have not been systematically identified. Here, we present FishTaco, an analytical and computational framework that integrates taxonomic and functional comparative analyses to accurately quantify taxon-level contributions to disease-associated functional shifts. Applying FishTaco to several large-scale metagenomic cohorts, we show that shifts in the microbiome’s functional capacity can be traced back to specific taxa. Furthermore, the set of taxa driving functional shifts and their contribution levels vary markedly between functions. We additionally find that similar functional imbalances in different diseases are driven by both disease-specific and shared taxa. Such integrated analysis of microbiome ecological and functional dynamics can inform future microbiome-based therapy, pinpointing putative intervention targets for manipulating the microbiome’s functional capacity.

Abstract: Human breast tumors contain significant amounts of stromal cells. There exists strong evidence that these stromal cells support cancer development and progression by altering various pathways (e.g. downregulation of tumor suppressor genes or autocrine signaling loops). Here, we suggest that stromal carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), shown to be generated from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, may (i) recycle tumor-derived lactate for their own energetic requirements, thereby sparing glucose for neighboring glycolytic tumor cells, and (ii) subsequently secrete surplus energetically and biosynthetically valuable metabolites of lactate oxidation, such as pyruvate, to support tumor growth. Lactate, taken up by stromal CAFs, is converted to pyruvate, which is then utilized by CAFs for energy needs as well as excreted and shared with tumor cells. We have interrogated lactate oxidation in CAFs to determine what metabolites may be secreted, and how they may affect the metabolism and growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We found that CAFs secrete pyruvate as a metabolite of lactate oxidation. Further, we show that pyruvate is converted to lactate to promote glycolysis in MDA-MB-231 cells and helps to control elevated ROS levels in these tumor cells. Finally, we found that inhibiting or interfering with ROS management, using the naturally occurring flavonoid phloretin (found in apple tree leaves), adds to the cytotoxicity of the conventional chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Our work demonstrates that a lactate-pyruvate, reciprocally-supportive metabolic relationship may be operative within the tumor microenvironment (TME) to support tumor growth, and may be a useful drug target.

Abstract: Summary
N-myristoylation is the covalent attachment of myristic acid to the N terminus of proteins in eukaryotic cells. The matrix domain (MA) of HIV-1 Gag protein is N-myristoylated and plays an important role in virus budding. In screening for host factors that interact with HIV-1 MA, we found that heme oxygenase (HO-2) specifically binds the myristate moiety of Gag. HO-2 was also found to bind TRAM, an adaptor protein for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and thereby impact both virus replication and cellular inflammatory responses. A crystal structure revealed that HO-2 binds myristate via a hydrophobic channel adjacent to the heme-binding pocket. Inhibiting HO-2 expression, or blocking myristate binding with a heme analog, led to marked increases in virus production. HO-2 deficiency caused hyperresponsive TRAM-dependent TLR4 signaling and hypersensitivity to the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide. Thus, HO-2 is a cellular myristate-binding protein that negatively regulates both virus replication and host inflammatory responses.

Abstract: Ancient associations between insects and bacteria provide models to study intimate host-microbe interactions. Currently, a wealth of genome sequence data for long-term, obligately intracellular (primary) endosymbionts of insects reveals profound genomic consequences of this specialized bacterial lifestyle. Those consequences include severe genome reduction and extreme base compositions. This minireview highlights the utility of genome sequence data to understand how, and why, endosymbionts have been pushed to such extremes, and to illuminate the functional consequences of such extensive genome change. While the static snapshots provided by individual endosymbiont genomes are valuable, comparative analyses of multiple genomes have shed light on evolutionary mechanisms. Namely, genome comparisons have told us that selection is important in fine-tuning gene content, but at the same time, mutational pressure and genetic drift contribute to genome degradation. Examples from Blochmannia, the primary endosymbiont of the ant tribe Camponotini, illustrate the value and constraints of genome sequence data, and exemplify how genomes can serve as a springboard for further comparative and experimental inquiry.

Abstract: SIRT6, with both deacetylase and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities, is predominantly expressed in the nucleus. It has been revealed that SIRT6 regulates various biological functions including metabolism, aging and stress resistance. This study aims to investigate the role of SIRT6 in vascular inflammation and it molecular mechanism. We found that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) did not alter the localization of SIRT6 in vascular adventitial fibroblasts (VAFs), vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The expression of SIRT1, SIRT6 was decreased in TNF-α-treated VAFs. In contrast, TNF-α significantly increased the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and interleukin (IL) −6. Knockdown of SIRT1 and SIRT6 by siRNA significantly enhanced TNF-α-induced expression of MCP-1 and IL-6, respectively. Overexpression of SIRT1 and SIRT6 inhibited TNF-α-induced expression of MCP-1 and IL-6 in VAFs. Moreover, we also found SIRT1 positively regulated the expression of SIRT6 in VAFs. In addition, knockdown of SIRT1 and SIRT6 respectively augmented TNF-α-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and Akt inhibitor MK2206 reduced TNF-α-induced mRNA expression of MCP-1 and IL-6 in VAFs. In vivo studies indicated that the expression of SIRT1, SIRT6 was decreased and the expression of MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-1β was increased in carotid collar-induced vascular inflammation. Taken together, these findings indicate that SIRT1 and SIRT6 inhibit TNF-α-induced inflammation in VAFs by ROS and Akt pathway.

Abstract: To achieve the goal of a first-in-human trial for human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based transplantation for the treatment of various diseases, allogeneic human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched hiPSC cell banks represent a realistic tool from the perspective of quality control and cost performance. Furthermore, considering the limited therapeutic time-window for acute injuries, including neurotraumatic injuries, an iPS cell bank is of potential interest. However, due to the relatively immunoprivileged environment of the central nervous system, it is unclear whether HLA matching is required in hiPSC-derived neural stem/progenitor cell (hiPSC-NS/PC) transplantation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and neurotraumatic injuries. In this study, we evaluated the significance of HLA matching in hiPSC-NS/PC transplantation by performing modified mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays with hiPSC-NS/PCs. Compared to fetus-derived NS/PCs, the expression levels of human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related (HLA-DR) and co-stimulatory molecules on hiPSC-NS/PCs were significantly low, even with the addition of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and/or interferon-γ (IFNγ) to mimic the inflammatory environment surrounding transplanted hiPSC-NS/PCs in injured tissues. Interestingly, both the allogeneic HLA-matched and the HLA-mismatched responses were similarly low in the modified MLR assay. Furthermore, the autologous response was also similar to the allogeneic response. hiPSC-NS/PCs suppressed the proliferative responses of allogeneic HLA-mismatched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the low antigen-presenting function and immunosuppressive effects of hiPSC-NS/PCs result in a depressed immune response, even in an allogeneic HLA-mismatched setting. It is crucial to verify whether these in vitro results are reproducible in a clinical setting.

Abstract: Commitment of adult stem cells involves the activation of specific gene networks regulated from transcription to protein synthesis. Here, we used ribosome profiling to identify mRNAs regulated at the translational level, through both differential association to polysomes and modulation of their translational rates. We observed that translational regulation during the differentiation of human adipose-derived stromal cells (hASCs, also known as adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells), a subset of which are stem cells, to adipocytes was a major regulatory event. hASCs showed a significant reduction of whole protein synthesis after adipogenic induction and a downregulation of the expression and translational efficiency of ribosomal proteins. Additionally, focal adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins were downregulated at the translational level. This negative regulation of the essential biological functions of hASCs resulted in a reduction in cell size and the potential of hASCs to migrate. We analyzed whether the inactivation of key translation initiation factors was involved in this observed major repression of translation. We showed that there was an increase in the hypo phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1, a negative regulator of translation, during early adipogenesis. Our results showed that extensive translational regulation occurred during the early stage of the adipogenic differentiation of hASCs.

Abstract: Although the zebrafish was initially developed as a model system to study embryonic development, it has gained increasing attention as an advantageous system to investigate human diseases, including intestinal disorders. Zebrafish embryos develop rapidly, and their digestive system is fully functional and visible by 5days post fertilization. There is a large degree of homology between the intestine of zebrafish and higher vertebrate organisms in terms of its cellular composition and function as both a digestive and immune organ. Furthermore, molecular pathways regulating injury and immune responses are highly conserved. In this chapter, we provide an overview of studies addressing developmental and physiological processes relevant to human intestinal disease. These studies include those related to congenital disorders, host–microbiota interactions, inflammatory diseases, motility disorders, and intestinal cancer. We also highlight the utility of zebrafish to functionally validate candidate genes identified through mutational analyses and genome-wide association studies, and discuss methodologies to investigate the intestinal biology that are unique to zebrafish.

Abstract: Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are highly expressed when organisms are exposed to thermal stresses. The HSPs are considered to play significant roles in thermal adaptation because they function as molecular chaperones facilitating proper protein synthesis. The expression of HSPs under field conditions, however, has not been evaluated much, and their importance, based on the ecological contexts in nature, is still unclear. We investigated this aspect in the larvae and adults of the flesh fly, Sarcophaga similis. These larvae spend their larval life in the carrion or faeces of vertebrates; therefore, they are less mobile and are occasionally exposed to high temperature. In contrast, the adults of this species can fly and, therefore, they are highly mobile. Massive transcription of Hsps was detected both in the larvae and adults in a laboratory heat-shock experiment. The larvae in the field showed no or less Hsp production on thermally mild days, whereas considerable upregulation of Hsp expression was detected on days with high temperature. The adults can also be exposed to thermal stress as high as 40°C or higher in the field. However, most of the flies showed no or less Hsp expression. The observations in the experimental cage under field conditions revealed behavioural thermoregulation of adults through microhabitat selection. The present study demonstrates ontogenetic alteration of the strategy to overcome thermal stress in an insect; in the field, less mobile larvae use physiological protection against heat (HSP production), whereas highly mobile adults avoid the stress behaviourally (through microhabitat selection).

Abstract: Summary
Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei is one of the leading causes of systemic mycosis in immunosuppressed or AIDS patients in Southeast Asia. How this intracellular pathogen evades the host immune defense remains unclear. We provide evidence that T. marneffei depletes levels of a key proinflammatory lipid mediator arachidonic acid (AA) to evade the host innate immune defense. Mechanistically, an abundant secretory mannoprotein Mp1p, shown previously to be a virulence factor, does so by binding AA with high affinity via a long hydrophobic central cavity found in the LBD2 domain. This sequesters a critical proinflammatory signaling lipid, and we see evidence that AA, AA's downstream metabolites, and the cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α are downregulated in T. marneffei-infected J774 macrophages. Given that Mp1p-LBD2 homologs are identified in other fungal pathogens, we expect that this novel class of fatty-acid-binding proteins sequestering key proinflammatory lipid mediators represents a general virulence mechanism of pathogenic fungi.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial changes have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The glycine to serine mutation (G2019S) in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the most common genetic cause for PD and has been shown to impair mitochondrial function and morphology in multiple model systems. We analyzed mitochondrial function in LRRK2 G2019S induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons to determine whether the G2019S mutation elicits similar mitochondrial deficits among central and peripheral nervous system neuron subtypes. LRRK2 G2019S iPSC-derived dopaminergic neuron cultures displayed unique abnormalities in mitochondrial distribution and trafficking, which corresponded to reduced sirtuin deacetylase activity and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels despite increased sirtuin levels. These data indicate that mitochondrial deficits in the context of LRRK2 G2019S are not a global phenomenon and point to distinct sirtuin and bioenergetic deficiencies intrinsic to dopaminergic neurons, which may underlie dopaminergic neuron loss in PD.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional latency of HIV is a last barrier to viral eradication. Chromatin-remodeling complexes and post-translational histone modifications likely play key roles in HIV-1 reactivation, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We performed an RNAi-based screen of human lysine methyltransferases and identified the SET and MYND domain-containing protein 2 (SMYD2) as an enzyme that regulates HIV-1 latency. Knockdown of SMYD2 or its pharmacological inhibition reactivated latent HIV-1 in T cell lines and in primary CD4+ T cells. SMYD2 associated with latent HIV-1 promoter chromatin, which was enriched in monomethylated lysine 20 at histone H4 (H4K20me1), a mark lost in cells lacking SMYD2. Further, we find that lethal 3 malignant brain tumor 1 (L3MBTL1), a reader protein with chromatin-compacting properties that recognizes H4K20me1, was recruited to the latent HIV-1 promoter in a SMYD2-dependent manner. We propose that a SMYD2-H4K20me1-L3MBTL1 axis contributes to HIV-1 latency and can be targeted with small-molecule SMYD2 inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical translation of cell-based strategies for regenerative medicine demands predictable in vivo performance where the use of sera during in vitro preparation inherently limits the efficacy and reproducibility. Here, we present a bioinspired approach by serum-free pre-conditioning of human periosteum-derived cells, followed by their assembly into microaggregates simultaneously primed with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2). Pre-conditioning resulted in a more potent progenitor cell population, while aggregation induced osteochondrogenic differentiation, further enhanced by BMP-2 stimulation. Ectopic implantation displayed a cascade of events that closely resembled the natural endochondral process resulting in bone ossicle formation. Assessment in a critical size long-bone defect in immunodeficient mice demonstrated successful bridging of the defect within 4 weeks, with active contribution of the implanted cells. In short, the presented serum-free process represents a biomimetic strategy, resulting in a cartilage tissue intermediate that, upon implantation, robustly leads to the healing of a large long-bone defect.

Abstract: Summary
The envelope glycoproteins (Env) of HIV-1 mediate cell entry through fusion of the viral envelope with a target cell membrane. Intramembrane mobility and clustering of Env trimers at the viral budding site are essential for its function. Previous live-cell and super-resolution microscopy studies were limited by lack of a functional fluorescent Env derivative, requiring antibody labeling for detection. Introduction of a bio-orthogonal amino acid by genetic code expansion, combined with click chemistry, offers novel possibilities for site-specific, minimally invasive labeling. Using this approach, we established efficient incorporation of non-canonical amino acids within HIV-1 Env in mammalian cells. The engineered protein retained plasma membrane localization, glycosylation, virion incorporation, and fusogenic activity, and could be rapidly and specifically labeled with synthetic dyes. This strategy allowed us to revisit Env dynamics and nanoscale distribution at the plasma membrane close to its native state, applying fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching and STED nanoscopy, respectively.

Abstract: Teeth develop through interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal tissues mediated by a signaling network comprised of growth factors and transcription factors. However, little is known about how epigenetic modifiers affect signaling pathways and thereby regulate tooth formation. We previously reported that the histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase (MTase) G9a is specifically enriched in the tooth mesenchyme during mouse development. In this study, we investigated the functions of G9a in tooth development using G9a conditional knockout (KO) mice. We used Sox9-Cre mice to delete G9a in the tooth mesenchyme because Sox9 is highly expressed in the mesenchyme derived from the cranial neural crest. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that G9a expression was significantly decreased in the mesenchyme of Sox9-Cre;G9afl/fl (G9a cKO) mice compared with that in Sox9-Cre;G9a fl/+(control) mice. Protein levels of the G9a substrate H3K9me2 were also decreased in the tooth mesenchyme. G9a cKO mice showed smaller tooth germ after embryonic day (E) 16.5 and E17.5, but not at E15.5. The developing cusp tips, which were visible in control mice, were absent in G9a cKO mice at E17.5. At 3 weeks after birth, small first molars with smaller cusps and unseparated roots were formed. Organ culture of tooth germs derived from E15.5 cKO mouse embryos showed impaired tooth development, suggesting that tooth development per se is affected independently of skull development. BrdU labeling experiments revealed that the proliferation rates were decreased in the mesenchyme in G9a cKO mice at E17.5. In addition, the proliferation rates in the tooth inner enamel epithelium were also decreased. In situ hybridization revealed altered localization of genes associated with tooth development. In cKO mice, intensively localized expression of mRNAs encoding bone morphogenic protein (Bmp2 and Bmp4) was observed in the tooth mesenchyme at E17.5, similar to the expression patterns observed in control mice at E15.5. Localization of Shh and related signaling components, including Gli1, Ptch1, and Ptch2, in the tooth mesenchyme of cKO mice was generally similar to that at earlier stages in control mice. In addition, expression of Fgf3 and Fgf10 in the mesenchyme was decreased in G9a cKO mice at P0. Expression levels of Fgf9 and p21, both of which were expressed in the secondary enamel-knot, were also decreased. Thus, the expression of genes associated with tooth development was delayed in cKO mice. Our results suggest that H3K9MTase G9a regulates cell proliferation and timing of differentiation and that G9a expression in the tooth mesenchyme is required for proper tooth development.

Abstract: Summary
Characterization of non-neoplastic and malignant human stem cell populations in their native state can provide new insights into gliomagenesis. Here we developed a purification strategy to directly isolate EGFR+/− populations from human germinal matrix (GM) and adult subventricular zone autopsy tissues, and from de novo glioblastoma (GBM) resections, enriching for cells capable of binding EGF ligand (LBEGFR+), and uniquely compared their functional and molecular properties. LBEGFR+ populations in both GM and GBM encompassed all sphere-forming cells and displayed proliferative stem cell properties in vitro. In xenografts, LBEGFR+ GBM cells showed robust tumor initiation and progression to high-grade, infiltrative gliomas. Whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis confirmed enrichment of proliferative pathways in both developing and neoplastic freshly isolated EGFR+ populations, and identified both unique and shared sets of genes. The ability to prospectively isolate stem cell populations using native ligand-binding capacity opens new doors onto understanding both normal human development and tumor cell biology.

Abstract: Summary
Loss-of-function mutations in the cytosine-5 RNA methylase NSUN2 cause neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, yet the underlying cellular processes leading to the symptoms that include microcephaly remain unclear. Here, we show that NSUN2 is expressed in early neuroepithelial progenitors of the developing human brain, and its expression is gradually reduced during differentiation of human neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells in vitro. In the developing Nsun2−/− mouse cerebral cortex, intermediate progenitors accumulate and upper-layer neurons decrease. Loss of NSUN2-mediated methylation of tRNA increases their endonucleolytic cleavage by angiogenin, and 5′ tRNA fragments accumulate in Nsun2−/− brains. Neural differentiation of NES cells is impaired by both NSUN2 depletion and the presence of angiogenin. Since repression of NSUN2 also inhibited neural cell migration toward the chemoattractant fibroblast growth factor 2, we conclude that the impaired differentiation capacity in the absence of NSUN2 may be driven by the inability to efficiently respond to growth factors.

Abstract: As a result of exposure to stress conditions, mutations, or defects during synthesis, cellular proteins are prone to misfold. To cope with such partially denatured proteins, cells mount a regulated transcriptional response involving the Hsf1 transcription factor, which drives the synthesis of molecular chaperones and other stress-relieving proteins. Here, we show that the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologues of human BAG-1, Bag101, and Bag102, are Hsp70 co-chaperones that associate with 26S proteasomes. Only a subgroup of Hsp70-type chaperones, including Ssa1, Ssa2, and Sks2, binds Bag101 and Bag102 and key residues in the Hsp70 ATPase domains, required for interaction with Bag101 and Bag102, were identified. In humans, BAG-1 overexpression is typically observed in cancers. Overexpression of bag101 and bag102 in fission yeast leads to a strong growth defect caused by triggering Hsp70 to release and activate the Hsf1 transcription factor. Accordingly, the bag101-linked growth defect is alleviated in strains containing a reduced amount of Hsf1 but aggravated in hsp70 deletion strains. In conclusion, we propose that the fission yeast UBL/BAG proteins release Hsf1 from Hsp70, leading to constitutive Hsf1 activation and growth defects.

Abstract: NADPH oxidase (NOX) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and has been suggested to mediate cell proliferation in some cancers. Here, we show that an increase in the expression of NOX5 long form (NOX5-L) is critical for tumor progression in breast tumor tissues. Immunostaining of clinical samples indicated that NOX5 was overexpressed in 41.1% of breast ductal carcinoma samples. NOX5-L depletion consistently suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in vitro. Antibody-mediated neutralization of NOX5-L attenuated tumor progression in a mouse xenograft model. Promoter analysis revealed that NOX5-L expression is regulated by STAT5A in breast cancer cells. Based on our novel findings, we suggest that inhibition of NOX5-L may be a promising therapeutic strategy that exerts anti-cancer effects via the modulation of ROS-mediated cell signaling.

Abstract: Activin A belongs to the superfamily of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and is a critical regulatory cytokine in breast cancer and inflammation. However, the role of activin A in migration of breast cancer cells and immune cells was not well characterized. Here, a microfluidic device was used to examine the effect of activin A on the migration of human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cells and human blood neutrophils as well as their migratory interaction. We found that activin A promoted the basal migration but impaired epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced migration of breast cancer cells. By contrast, activin A reduced neutrophil chemotaxis and transendothelial migration to N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). Finally, activin A promoted neutrophil chemotaxis to the supernatant from breast cancer cell culture. Collectively, our study revealed the different roles of activin A in regulating the migration of breast cancer cells and neutrophils and their migratory interaction. These findings suggested the potential of activin A as a therapeutic target for inflammation and breast cancers.

Abstract: Breast tumors are heterogeneous and carry a small population of progenitor cells that can produce various subtypes of breast cancer. SATB2 (special AT-rich binding protein-2) is a newly identified transcription factor and epigenetic regulator. It is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells, but not in adult tissues, and regulates pluripotency-maintaining factors. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SATB2 induces transformation of human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) leading to malignant phenotype are unknown. The main goal of this paper is to examine the molecular mechanisms by which SATB2 induces cellular transformation of HMECs into cells that are capable of self-renewal. SATB2-transformed HMECs gain the phenotype of breast progenitor cells by expressing markers of stem cells, pluripotency-maintaining factor, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. SATB2 is highly expressed in human breast cancer cell lines, primary mammary tissues and cancer stem cells (CSCs), but not in HMECs and normal breast tissues. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that SATB2 can directly bind to promoters of Bcl-2, c-Myc, Nanog, Klf4, and XIAP, suggesting a role of SATB2 in regulation of pluripotency, cell survival and proliferation. Furthermore, inhibition of SATB2 by shRNA in breast cancer cell lines and CSCs attenuates cell proliferation and EMT phenotype. Our results suggest that SATB2 induces dedifferentiation/transformation of mature HMECs into progenitor-like cells.

Abstract: Degenerative valvular diseases have been linked to the action of abnormal forces on valve tissues during each cardiac cycle. It is now accepted that the degenerative behavior of valvular cells can be induced mechanically in vitro. This approach of in vitro modeling of valvular cells in culture constitutes a powerful tool to study, characterize, and develop predictors of heart valve degeneration in vivo. Using such in vitro systems, we expect to determine the exact signaling mechanisms that trigger and mediate propagation of degenerative signals. In this study, we aim to uncover the role of mechanosensing proteins on valvular cell membranes. These can be cell receptors and triggers of downstream pathways that are activated upon the action of cyclical tensile strains in pathophysiological conditions. In order to identify mechanosensors of tensile stresses on valvular interstitial cells, we employed biaxial cyclic strain of valvular cells in culture and quantitatively evaluated the expression of cell membrane proteins using a targeted protein array and interactome analyses. This approach yielded a high-throughput screening of all cell surface proteins involved in sensing mechanical stimuli. In this study, we were able to identify the cell membrane proteins which are activated during physiological cyclic tensile stresses of valvular cells. The proteins identified in this study were clustered into four interactomes, which included CC chemokine ligands, thrombospondin (adhesive glycoproteins), growth factors, and interleukins. The expression levels of these proteins generally indicated that cells tend to increase adhesive efforts to counteract the action of mechanical forces. This is the first study of this kind used to comprehensively identify the mechanosensitive proteins in valvular cells.

Abstract: Induction of HSP72 is a natural response of stressed organisms that protects against many insults including bacterial diseases in farm (aquatic) animals. It would therefore be of great health benefit to search for natural compounds that are clinically safe yet able to induce HSP72 in animals. The phenolic compound carvacrol, an approved food component, had been shown in in vitro study to act as a co-inducer of HSP72, enhancing HSP72 production only in combination with a bona fide stress compared to the compound alone. However, in vitro model systems do not completely represent an in vivo physiology. Here, using the well-established gnotobiotic Artemia model system, we determined whether carvacrol could induce HSP72 in vivo, whether this putative effect could generate resistance in Artemia against biotic/abiotic stress and also unraveled the mechanism behind the possible HSP72-inducing effect of carvacrol. The gnotobiotic system is crucial for such studies because it avoids the interference of any extraneous factors on host-compound interaction. Here, carvacrol was shown to be a potent HSP72 inducer. Induction of HSP72 was associated with the generation of resistance in Artemia larvae against subsequent lethal heat stress or pathogenic Vibrio harveyi. Our results also provided new insight on the mode of HSP72 inducing action of carvacrol, in which the initial generation of reactive molecule H2O2 by the compound plays a key role. Overall results add new information about the bioactivity of carvacrol and advance our knowledge of this compound as potential prophylactic agent for controlling Vibrio infection in aquaculture animals.

Abstract: Summary
POLR3G is expressed at high levels in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and is required for maintenance of stem cell state through mechanisms not known in detail. To explore how POLR3G regulates stem cell state, we carried out deep-sequencing analysis of polyA+ and smallRNA transcriptomes present in hPSCs and regulated in POLR3G-dependent manner. Our data reveal that POLR3G regulates a specific subset of the hPSC transcriptome, including multiple transcript types, such as protein-coding genes, long intervening non-coding RNAs, microRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs, and affects RNA splicing. The primary function of POLR3G is in the maintenance rather than repression of transcription. The majority of POLR3G polyA+ transcriptome is regulated during differentiation, and the key pluripotency factors bind to the promoters of at least 30% of the POLR3G-regulated transcripts. Among the direct targets of POLR3G, POLG is potentially important in sustaining stem cell status in a POLR3G-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Over 2,000 human proteins are predicted to be secreted, but the biological function of the many of these proteins is still unknown. Moreover, a number of these proteins may act as new therapeutic agents or be targets for the development of therapeutic antibodies. To further explore the extracellular proteome, we have developed a secretome-enriched open reading frame (ORF) library that can be readily screened for autocrine activity in cell-based phenotypic or reporter assays. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and database analysis predict that the library contains approximately 900 ORFs encoding known secreted proteins (accounting for 77.8% of the library), as well as genes encoding potentially unknown secreted proteins. In a proof-of-principle study, human TF-1 cells were screened for proliferative factors, and the known cytokine GMCSF was identified as a dominant hit. This library offers a relatively low-cost and straightforward approach for functional autocrine screens of secreted proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Of the thousands of long noncoding RNAs expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), few have known roles and fewer have been functionally implicated in the regulation of self-renewal and pluripotency, or the reprogramming of somatic cells to the pluripotent state. In ESCs, Cyrano is a stably expressed long intergenic noncoding RNA with no previously assigned role. We demonstrate that Cyrano contributes to ESC maintenance, as its depletion results in the loss of hallmarks of self-renewal. Delineation of Cyrano's network through transcriptomics revealed widespread effects on signaling pathways and gene expression networks that contribute to ESC maintenance. Cyrano shares unique sequence complementarity with the differentiation-associated microRNA, mir-7, and mir-7 overexpression reduces expression of a key self-renewal factor to a similar extent as Cyrano knockdown. This suggests that Cyrano functions to restrain the action of mir-7. Altogether, we provide a view into the multifaceted function of Cyrano in ESC maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Secreted factors are a key component of stem cell niche and their dysregulation compromises stem cell function. Legumain is a secreted cysteine protease involved in diverse biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that legumain regulates lineage commitment of human bone marrow stromal cells and that its expression level and cellular localization are altered in postmenopausal osteoporotic patients. As shown by genetic and pharmacological manipulation, legumain inhibited osteoblast (OB) differentiation and in vivo bone formation through degradation of the bone matrix protein fibronectin. In addition, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of legumain activity led to precocious OB differentiation and increased vertebral mineralization in zebrafish. Finally, we show that localized increased expression of legumain in bone marrow adipocytes was inversely correlated with adjacent trabecular bone mass in a cohort of patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Our data suggest that altered proteolytic activity of legumain in the bone microenvironment contributes to decreased bone mass in postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to form teratomas in vivo containing multiple somatic cell types is regarded as functional evidence of pluripotency for human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Since the Teratoma assay is animal dependent, laborious, and only qualitative, the PluriTest and the hPSC ScoreCard assay have been developed as in vitro alternatives. Here we compared normal hPSCs, induced hPSCs (hiPSCs) with reactivated reprogramming transgenes, and human embryonal carcinoma cells (hECs) in these assays. While normal hPSCs gave rise to typical teratomas, the xenografts of the hECs and the hiPSCs with reactivated reprogramming transgenes were largely undifferentiated and malignant. The hPSC ScoreCard assay confirmed the line-specific differentiation propensities in vitro. However, when undifferentiated cells were analyzed by the PluriTest, only hECs were identified as abnormal whereas all other cell lines were indistinguishable and resembled normal hPSCs. Our results indicate that pluripotency assays are best selected on the basis of intended downstream applications.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are increasingly implicated in brain pathology, particularly neurodegenerative disease, with many genes implicated in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and motor neuron disease expressed in microglia. There is, therefore, a need for authentic, efficient in vitro models to study human microglial pathological mechanisms. Microglia originate from the yolk sac as MYB-independent macrophages, migrating into the developing brain to complete differentiation. Here, we recapitulate microglial ontogeny by highly efficient differentiation of embryonic MYB-independent iPSC-derived macrophages then co-culture them with iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Co-cultures retain neuronal maturity and functionality for many weeks. Co-culture microglia express key microglia-specific markers and neurodegenerative disease-relevant genes, develop highly dynamic ramifications, and are phagocytic. Upon activation they become more ameboid, releasing multiple microglia-relevant cytokines. Importantly, co-culture microglia downregulate pathogen-response pathways, upregulate homeostatic function pathways, and promote a more anti-inflammatory and pro-remodeling cytokine response than corresponding monocultures, demonstrating that co-cultures are preferable for modeling authentic microglial physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Host-to-host transmission is a critical step for infection. Here we studied transmission of the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae in an infant mouse model. Transmission from nasally colonized pups required high levels of bacterial shedding in nasal secretions and was temporally correlated with, and dependent upon, the acute inflammatory response. Pneumolysin, a pore-forming cytotoxin and major virulence determinant, was both necessary and sufficient to promote inflammation, which increased shedding and allowed for intralitter transmission. Direct contact between pups was not required for transmission indicating the importance of an environmental reservoir. An additional in vivo effect of pneumolysin was to enhance bacterial survival outside of the host. Our findings provide experimental evidence of a microbial strategy for transit to new hosts and explain why an organism expresses a toxin that damages the host upon which it depends.

Abstract: Planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins are implicated in a variety of morphogenetic processes including embryonic cell migration and potentially cancer progression. During zebrafish gastrulation, the transmembrane protein Vang-like 2 (VANGL2) is required for PCP and directed cell migration. These cell behaviors occur in the context of a fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM). While it is thought that interactions with the ECM regulate cell migration, it is unclear how PCP proteins such as VANGL2 influence these events. Using an in vitro cell culture model system, we previously showed that human VANGL2 negatively regulates membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP14) and activation of secreted matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Here, we investigated the functional relationship between VANGL2, integrin αvβ3, and MMP2 activation. We provide evidence that VANGL2 regulates cell surface integrin αvβ3 expression and adhesion to fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin. Inhibition of MMP14/MMP2 activity suppressed the cell adhesion defect in VANGL2 knockdown cells. Furthermore, our data show that MMP14 and integrin αv are required for increased proteolysis by VANGL2 knockdown cells. Lastly, we have identified integrin αvβ3 as a novel VANGL2 binding partner. Together, these findings begin to dissect the molecular underpinnings of how VANGL2 regulates MMP activity and cell adhesion to the ECM.

Abstract: Volume is a basic physical property of cells; however, it has been poorly investigated in cell biology so far, mostly because it is difficult to measure it precisely. Recently, large efforts were made to experimentally measure mammalian cell size and used mass, density, or volume as proxies for cell size. Here, we describe a method enabling cell volume measurements for single living cells. The method is based on the principle of fluorescent dye exclusion and can be easily implemented in cell biology laboratories. As this method is very versatile, it can be used for cells of different sizes, adherent or growing in suspension, over several cell cycles and is independent of cell shape changes. The method is also compatible with traditional cell biology tools such as epifluorescence imaging or drug treatments.

Abstract: Decreased bone volume and strength with aging and enhanced risk of fractures are in part due to reduced number of bone-forming mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cellular dysfunction. In a previous study, we found that osteogenic differentiation of the multipotent and omnipotent preosteoblasts are accompanied by the alterations of intracellular NAD metabolism in which nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) plays a regulatory role. The increased Nampt during osteoblast differentiation, the enzyme catalyzing NAD resynthesis from nicotinamide was noted. However, whether Nampt will also be able to affect osteogenic differentiation of primary bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), it is still uncertain. Here we report the role of Nampt in regulating osteoblast differentiation in primary mouse BM-MSCs. We found that Nampt expression was progressively elevated during BM-MSCs osteogenic differentiation. The Nampt inhibitor FK866 or knock-down of Nampt in BM-MSCs led to declined osteoblastogenesis, including attenuated ALP activity, diminished matrix mineralization and down-regulated osteoblast specific marker genes. In addition, declined osteoblastogenesis by Nampt deficiency or addition of FK866 was related to lower intracellular NAD concentration and decreased Sirt1 activity. The present findings demonstrate that osteogenic differentiation in MSCs can be modulated by intracellular NAD metabolism, in which Nampt may serve as an applicable marker for the osteoblast determination.

Abstract: Summary
Reporter cell lines have already proven valuable in identifying, tracking, and purifying cardiac subtypes and progenitors during differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We previously showed that chick ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) is highly enriched in human atrial cardiomyocytes (CMs), but not ventricular. Here, we targeted mCherry to the COUP-TFII genomic locus in hPSCs expressing GFP from the NKX2.5 locus. This dual atrial NKX2.5EGFP/+-COUP-TFIImCherry/+ reporter line allowed identification and selection of GFP+ (G+)/mCherry+ (M+) CMs following cardiac differentiation. These cells exhibited transcriptional and functional properties of atrial CMs, whereas G+/M− CMs displayed ventricular characteristics. Via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout, we demonstrated that COUP-TFII is not required for atrial specification in hPSCs. This new tool allowed selection of human atrial and ventricular CMs from mixed populations, of relevance for studying cardiac specification, developing human atrial disease models, and examining distinct effects of drugs on the atrium versus ventricle.

Abstract: Fertility preservation in prepubertal boys facing gonadotoxic treatment is still at the experimental stage. Nevertheless cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue (ITT) obtained by small testicular biopsy is being increasingly proposed in reproductive care clinics for this purpose. Different approaches to in vivo or in vitro mature spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) contained in ITT have been studied: autografting of testicular tissue pieces, transplantation of one's own purified germ cell suspensions, and in vitro maturation (IVM) for subsequent use of sperm for intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). While complete spermatogenesis yielding fertile offspring has been achieved in a number of animal species after cell and tissue transplantation and IVM, no mature sperm has yet been obtained from human prepubertal SSCs. This review describes research conducted by our team and a number of others working on fertility restoration from SSCs, with special emphasis on debated concerns and progress made towards clinical application of different strategies.

Abstract: KIF3b is a protein of the kinesin-2 family which plays an important role in intraflagellar transport. Testis cancer is a common cancer among young men. Its diagnostic rate is increasing and over half of the cases are seminomas. Many aspects of the mechanism and gene expression background of this cancer remain unclear. Using western-blotting and semi-quantitative PCR we found high protein levels of KIF3b enrichment in seminoma tissue despite the mRNA levels remaining equivalent to that of normal testicular tissues. The distribution of KIF3b was mainly in cells with division potential. Wound-healing assays and cell counting kit assays showed that the knockdown of KIF3b significantly suppressed cell migration ability, viability and number in HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence images during the cell cycle revealed that KIF3b tended to gather at the spindles and was enriched at the central spindle. This indicated that KIF3b may also have direct impacts upon spindle formation and cytokinesis. By counting the numbers of nuclei, spindles and cells, we found that the rates of multipolar division and multi-nucleation were raised in KIF3b-knockdown cells. In this way we demonstrate that KIF3b functions importantly in mitosis and may be essential to seminoma cell division and proliferation as well as being necessary for normal cell division.

Abstract: Multipotent muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) have been identified as potential seed cells for bone tissue engineering. However, MuSCs exhibit a rapid loss of stemness after in vitro culturing, thereby compromising their therapeutic efficiency. Muscle segment homeobox gene 1 (msx1) has been found to induce the dedifferentiation of committed progenitor cells, as well as terminally differentiated myotubes. In this study, a Tet-off retroviral gene delivery system was used to modulate msx1 expression. After ten passages, MuSCs that did not express msx-1 (e.g., the non-msx1 group) were compared with MuSCs with induced msx-1 expression (e.g., the msx1 group). The latter group exhibited a more juvenile morphology, it contained a significantly lower percentage of senescent cells characterized by positive β-galactosidase staining, and it exhibited increased proliferation and a higher proliferation index. Immunocytochemical stainings further detected a more primitive gene expression profile for the msx1 group, while osteogenic differentiation assays and ectopic bone formation assays demonstrated an improved capacity for the msx1 group to undergo osteogenic differentiation. These results suggest that transient expression of msx1 in MuSCs can retain a primitive state, thereby enhancing their capacity for osteogenic differentiation and restoring the potential for MuSCs to serve as seed cells for bone tissue engineering.

Abstract: The bioactive sphingolipid ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) regulates cell division in a variety of cell types including macrophages. However, the mechanisms involved in this action are not completely understood. In the present work we show that C1P stimulates the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in RAW264.7 macrophages, and that this growth factor is essential for stimulation of cell proliferation by C1P. The stimulation of VEGF release was dependent upon activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB-1 also known as Akt-1), and mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase (MEK)/extracellularly regulated kinase-2 (ERK-2) pathways, as inhibition of these kinases with selective pharmacological inhibitors or with specific gene silencing siRNA, abrogated VEGF release. A key observation was that sequestration of VEGF with a neutralizing antibody, or treatment with VEGF siRNA abolished C1P-stimulated macrophage growth. Also, inhibition of the pathways involved in C1P-stimulated VEGF release inhibited the stimulation of macrophage growth by C1P. Moreover, blockade of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), which is the primary receptor for VEGF, with the pharmacological inhibitor DMH4, or with specific VEGFR-2 siRNA, substantially inhibited C1P-stimulated cell growth. It can be concluded that stimulation of VEGF release is a key factor in the promotion of macrophage proliferation by C1P.

Abstract: Summary
Environmental estrogens and anti-hormone therapies for breast cancer have diverse tissue- and signaling-pathway-selective outcomes, but how estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) mediates this phenotypic diversity is poorly understood. We implemented a statistical approach to allow unbiased, parallel analyses of multiple crystal structures, and identified subtle perturbations of ERα structure by different synthetic and environmental estrogens. Many of these perturbations were in the sub-Å range, within the noise of the individual structures, but contributed significantly to the activities of synthetic and environmental estrogens. Combining structural perturbation data from many structures with quantitative cellular activity profiles of the ligands enabled identification of structural rules for ligand-specific allosteric signaling—predicting activity from structure. This approach provides a framework for understanding the diverse effects of environmental estrogens and for guiding iterative medicinal chemistry efforts to generate improved breast cancer therapies, an approach that can be applied to understanding other ligand-regulated allosteric signaling pathways.

Abstract: Macrophages are resistant to cell death and are one of HIV reservoirs. HIV viral protein Vpr has the potential to promote infection of and survival of macrophages, which could be a highly significant factor in the development and/or maintenance of macrophage viral reservoirs. However, the impact of vpr on macrophages resistance to apoptosis is yet to be comprehended. Autophagy is a cell survival mechanism under stress state. In this study, we investigated whether autophagy is involved in macrophages resistant to vpr-induced apoptosis. Using the THP1 macrophages, we studied the interconnection between macrophages resistance to apoptosis and autophagy. We found that vpr is able to trigger autophagy in transfected THP-1 macrophages confirmed by electron microscopy (EM) and western blot analysis, and inhibition of autophagy with 3MA increased vpr-induced apoptosis. The results indicate that autophagy may be responsible for maintenance of macrophage HIV reservoirs.

Abstract: Most existing culture media for cardiac differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) contain significant amounts of albumin. For clinical transplantation applications of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs), culturing cells in an albumin containing environment raises the concern of pathogen contamination and immunogenicity to the recipient patients. In addition, batch-to-batch variation of albumin may cause the inconsistent of hPSC cardiac differentiation. Here, we demonstrated that antioxidants l-ascorbic acid, trolox, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and sodium pyruvate could functionally substitute albumin in the culture medium, and formulated an albumin-free, chemical-defined medium (S12 medium). We showed that S12 medium could support efficient hPSC cardiac differentiation with significantly improved reproducibility, and maintained long-term culture of hPSC-CMs. Furthermore, under chemical-defined and albumin-free conditions, human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were established, and differentiated into highly homogenous atrial and ventricular myocytes in a scalable fashion with normal electrophysiological properties. Finally, we characterized the activity of three typical cardiac ion channels of those cells, and demonstrated that hPSC-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (hPSC-vCMs) were suitable for drug cardiac safety evaluation. In summary, this simplified, chemical-defined and albumin-free culture medium supports efficient generation and maintaining of hPSC-CMs and facilitates both research and clinical applications of these cells.

Abstract: The combination of non-human primate animals and their induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) provides not only transplantation models for cell-based therapy of heart diseases, but also opportunities for heart-related drug research on both cellular and animal levels. However, the subtypes and electrophysiology properties of non-human primate iPSC-CMs hadn't been detailed characterized. In this study, we generated rhesus monkey induced pluripotent stem cells (riPSCs), and efficiently differentiated them into ventricular or atrial cardiomyocytes by modulating retinoic acid (RA) pathways. Our results revealed that the electrophysiological characteristics and response to canonical drugs of riPSC-CMs were similar with those of human pluripotent stem cell derived CMs. Therefore, rhesus monkeys and their iPSC-CMs provide a powerful and practicable system for heart related biomedical research.

Abstract: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) exhibits a critical but poorly understood regulatory signaling function and has been shown to promote proliferation, vascularization and migration in several types of cells and tissues. However, little is known about the specific role of NPY in the proliferation and apoptosis of bone marrow stromal cells (also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, BMSCs), which contain a subpopulation of multipotent skeletal stem cells. Based on BrdU incorporation tests, Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, we showed that NPY significantly promoted the proliferation of BMSCs in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal effect observed at a concentration of 10−10M for pro-proliferative and 10−12M for anti-apoptotic activities. Furthermore, NPY significantly increased the percentage of cells in S and G2/M phases. In addition, NPY exhibited a protective effect after 24h of serum starvation as illustrated by a reduction in the apoptosis rate, degree of nuclear condensation, and expression of apoptosis markers, including caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bax mRNA expression. NPY also increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of canonical Wnt signaling pathway proteins, including β-catenin and c-myc, during the induced proliferative and anti-apoptotic processes. However, the proliferative and anti-apoptotic activities of NPY were partially blocked by both PD160170 (1μM) and DKK1 (0.2μg/mL). These compounds also blocked the mRNA and protein expression of β-catenin, p-GSK-3β and c-myc. Therefore, the results of the present study demonstrated that NPY exerts a proliferative and protective effect on BMSCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner in vitro, and importantly, these effects may be mediated via its Y1 receptor and involved in activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

Abstract: The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface receptor with primary implications in cell growth in both normal and malignant tissue. Paradoxically, cell lines that hyperexpress the EGFR have been documented to undergo receptor-mediated apoptosis. The underlying mechanism by which EGF-induced apoptosis occurs however remains inexplicit. In an attempt to identify this mechanism, we assessed downstream effectors of EGFR in MDA-MB-468 cells during conditions of EGF-induced apoptosis. The effector assessment revealed STAT3 as a potential mediator of EGF-induced apoptosis. Alternative strategies for activating STAT3, independent of EGFR stimulation, resulted in the induction of the apoptotic pathways. A reduction in STAT3 expression via RNAi resulted in a significant attenuation of EGF-induced PARP cleavage. Our findings support STAT3 as a positive mediator of EGF-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques have made a huge advancement recently, providing close to atomic resolution of the structure of protein complexes. Interestingly, this imaging technique can be performed in cells, giving access to the molecular machines in their natural context, therefore bridging structural and cell biology. However, in situ structural electron microscopy faces one major challenge, which is the ability to focus on specific subcellular regions to capture the objects of interest. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) is one very efficient solution for this. Here we present a sample preparation technique that enables cryo-sections of vitrified cell monolayers in an orientation that places the cryo-section parallel to the fluorescence imaging plane. The main advantage of this approach is that it exploits the potentials of CLEM for cryo-EM investigation, for selecting specific cells of interest in a heterogeneous population, or for finding identified subcellular regions on sections.

Abstract: Diverse cellular functions require the establishment of cell polarity. Although the morphological manifestation of cell polarity can be complex, common principles and conserved regulatory pathways can be studied leveraging the powerful genetic tools in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A vast array of genetic and cell biological tools and interdisciplinary approaches have been employed to understand the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity in budding yeast. These tools enabled the identification of key molecular components, their mechanisms of action, and the pathway governing the spatiotemporal properties of cell polarity. In this review, we describe a set of useful methods with special focus on the combination of genetic manipulation and quantitative live-cell imaging, as well as advanced microscopy-based quantitative analysis, for studying symmetry-breaking process in budding yeast. Specific examples are included to illustrate the utilities of each method.

Abstract: The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult mammalian brain hosts full potential neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs are able to respond to extracellular signals in the brain, amplifying the pool of progenitor cells and giving rise to neuroblasts that show ability to migrate towards an injury site. These signals can come from vascular system, cerebrospinal fluid, glial cells, or projections of neurons in adjoining regions. CXCL12, a chemokine secreted after brain injury, reaches the SVZ in a gradient manner and drives neuroblasts towards the lesion area. Among many other molecules, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP-2/9) are also released during brain injury. MMP-2/9 can cleave CXCL12 generating a new molecule, CXCL12(5-67), and its effects on NSCs viability is not well described. Here we produced recombinant CXCL12 and CXCL12(5-67) and evaluated their effect in murine adult NSCs migration and survival in vitro. We showed CXCL12(5-67) does not promote NSCs migration, but does induce cell death. The NSC death induced by CXCL12(5-67) involves caspases 9 and 3/7 activation, implying the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in this phenomenon. Our evidences in vitro make CXCL12(5-67) and its receptor potential candidates for brain injuries and neurodegeneration studies.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies using defined transcription factors to convert skin fibroblasts into chondrocytes have raised the question of whether osteo-chondroprogenitors expressing SOX9 and RUNX2 could also be generated during the course of the reprogramming process. Here, we demonstrated that doxycycline-inducible expression of reprogramming factors (KLF4 [K] and c-MYC [M]) for 6 days were sufficient to convert murine fibroblasts into SOX9+/RUNX2+ cellular aggregates and together with SOX9 (S) promoted the conversion efficiency when cultured in a defined stem cell medium, mTeSR. KMS-reprogrammed cells possess gene expression profiles akin to those of native osteo-chondroprogenitors with elevated osteogenic properties and can differentiate into osteoblasts and chondrocytes in vitro, but form bone tissue upon transplantation under the skin and in the fracture site of mouse tibia. Altogether, we provide a reprogramming strategy to enable efficient derivation of osteo-chondrogenic cells that may hold promise for cell replacement therapy not limited to cartilage but also for bone tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Leydig cells (LCs) play crucial roles in producing testosterone, and their dysfunction leads to male hypogonadism. LC transplantation is a promising alternative therapy for male hypogonadism. However, the source of LCs limits this strategy for clinical applications. Here, we report our success in reprogramming mice fibroblasts into LCs by expressing three transcriptional factors, Dmrt1, Gata4, and Nr5a1. The induced Leydig-like cells (iLCs) expressed steroidogenic genes, had a global gene expression profile similar to that of adult LCs, and acquired androgen synthesis capabilities. When iLCs were transplanted into rats or mice testes that were selectively depleted of endogenous LCs, the transplanted cells could survive and function in the interstitium of testis, resulting in the restoration of normal levels of serum testosterone. These findings demonstrate that the fibroblasts were able to be directly converted into iLCs by few defined factors, which may facilitate future applications in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represent a potentially valuable cell source for applications in cell replacement therapy, drug development, and disease modeling. For all these uses, it is necessary to develop reproducible and robust protocols for differentiation into desired cell types. However, differentiation protocols remain unstable and inefficient, which makes minimizing the differentiation variance among hPSC lines and obtaining purified terminally differentiated cells extremely time consuming. Here, we report a simple treatment with three small molecules—SB431542, dorsomorphine, and CHIR99021—that enhanced hPSC differentiation into three germ layers with a chemically transitional embryoid-body-like state (CTraS). Induction of CTraS reduced the innate differentiation propensities of hPSCs (even unfavorably differentiated hPSCs) and shifted their differentiation into terminally differentiated cells, particularly neurons. In addition, CTraS induction accelerated in vitro pathological expression concurrently with neural maturation. Thus, CTraS can promote the latent potential of hPSCs for differentiation and potentially expand the utility and applicability of hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular pathogens manipulate host organelles to support replication within cells. For Legionella pneumophila, the bacterium translocates proteins that establish an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated replication compartment. We show here that the bacterial Sde proteins target host reticulon 4 (Rtn4) to control tubular ER dynamics, resulting in tubule rearrangements as well as alterations in Rtn4 associated with the replication compartment. These rearrangements are triggered via Sde-promoted ubiquitin transfer to Rtn4, occurring almost immediately after bacterial uptake. Ubiquitin transfer requires two sequential enzymatic activities from a single Sde polypeptide: an ADP-ribosyltransferase and a nucleotidase/phosphohydrolase. The ADP-ribosylated moiety of ubiquitin is a substrate for the nucleotidase/phosphohydrolase, resulting in either transfer of ubiquitin to Rtn4 or phosphoribosylation of ubiquitin in the absence of a ubiquitination target. Therefore, a single bacterial protein drives a multistep biochemical pathway to control ubiquitination and tubular ER function independently of the host ubiquitin machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells have been proposed as an unlimited source of pancreatic β cells for studying and treating diabetes. However, the long, multi-step differentiation protocols used to generate functional β cells inevitably exhibit considerable variability, particularly when applied to pluripotent cells from diverse genetic backgrounds. We have developed culture conditions that support long-term self-renewal of human multipotent pancreatic progenitors, which are developmentally more proximal to the specialized cells of the adult pancreas. These cultured pancreatic progenitor (cPP) cells express key pancreatic transcription factors, including PDX1 and SOX9, and exhibit transcriptomes closely related to their in vivo counterparts. Upon exposure to differentiation cues, cPP cells give rise to pancreatic endocrine, acinar, and ductal lineages, indicating multilineage potency. Furthermore, cPP cells generate insulin+ β-like cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that they offer a convenient alternative to pluripotent cells as a source of adult cell types for modeling pancreatic development and diabetes.

Eicosapentaenoic acid ameliorates palmitate-induced lipotoxicity via the AMP kinase/dynamin-related protein-1 signaling pathway in differentiated H9c2 myocytes,

Abstract: Background
Emerging evidence suggested the preferable effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid) against cardiac lipotoxicity, which worsens cardiac function by means of excessive serum free fatty acids due to chronic adrenergic stimulation under heart failure. Nonetheless, the precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we focused on dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) as a possible modulator of the EPA-mediated cardiac protection against cardiac lipotoxicity, and investigated the causal relation between AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Drp1.
Methods and results
When differentiated H9c2 myocytes were exposed to palmitate (PAL; saturated fatty acid, 400µM) for 24h, these myocytes showed activation of caspases 3 and 7, enhanced caspase 3 cleavage, depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, depleted intracellular ATP, and enhanced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species. These changes suggested lipotoxicity due to excessive PAL. PAL enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation with increased Drp1 expression, as well. EPA (50µM) restored the PAL-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondrial fragmentation with increased Drp1 expression by PAL. EPA activated phosphorylation of AMPK, and pharmacological activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide ameliorated the PAL-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and downregulated Drp1. An AMPK knockdown via RNA interference enhanced Drp1 expression and attenuated the protective effects of EPA against the PAL-induced lipotoxicity.
Conclusion
EPA ameliorates the PAL-induced lipotoxicity via AMPK activation, which subsequently suppresses mitochondrial fragmentation and Drp1 expression. Our findings may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of EPA-mediated myocardial protection in heart failure.

Abstract: One recently discussed general mechanism affecting gene expression is 3’-untranslated region (3’UTR) length. Events such as shortening, translocation or loss of 3’UTRs are observed within oncogenes and are proposed to associate with increased expression. Thus, increased efforts are being made to understand constitutive and differential transcript 3’end formation. Investigation of AGR2 mRNA revealed a direct impact of its 3’UTR length on AGR2 expression. In silico analyses identified several regulatory sequences within the distal part of AGR2 mRNA that may regulate 3’UTR length and associated protein levels. Short 3’UTRs were observed in a panel of AGR2-positive cancer cell lines and in human breast cancer specimens, in which more extensive 3’UTR shortening correlated with increased AGR2 protein levels. AGR2 is an important member of PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, which along with the proposed involvement of mTOR in the regulation of alternative polyadenylation, prompted us to study the role of mTOR in relation to AGR2 mRNA 3’UTR shortening. A direct impact of mTOR signalling on AGR2 3’UTR shortening associated with increased protein synthesis was found, which led to the identification of a novel molecular mechanism involved in upregulation of AGR2 levels in mTOR-activated cells via modulating the 3’UTR length of AGR2 mRNA.

Abstract: The Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of recessive disorders of childhood with overlapping symptoms including vision loss, ataxia, cognitive regression and premature death. 14 different genes have been linked to NCLs (CLN1-CLN14), but the functions of the proteins encoded by the majority of these genes have not been fully elucidated. Mutations in the CLN5 gene are responsible for the Finnish variant late-infantile form of NCL (Finnish vLINCL). CLN5 is translated as a 407 amino acid transmembrane domain containing protein that is heavily glycosylated, and subsequently cleaved into a mature soluble protein. Functionally, CLN5 is implicated in the recruitment of the retromer complex to endosomes, which is required to sort the lysosomal sorting receptors from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. The mechanism that processes CLN5 into a mature soluble protein is currently not known. Herein, we demonstrate that CLN5 is initially translated as a type II transmembrane protein and subsequently cleaved by SPPL3, a member of the SPP/SPPL intramembrane protease family, into a mature soluble protein consisting of residues 93-407. The remaining N-terminal fragment is then cleaved by SPPL3 and SPPL2b and degraded in the proteasome. This work further characterizes the biology of CLN5 in the hopes of identifying a novel therapeutic strategy for affected children.

Abstract: Summary
Subtype-specific human cardiomyocytes (CMs) are valuable for basic and applied research. Induction of cardiomyogenesis and enrichment of nodal-like CMs was described for mouse pluripotent stem cells (mPSCs) in response to 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (EBIO), a chemical modulator of small-/intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels (SKs 1–4). Investigating EBIO in human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), we have applied three independent differentiation protocols of low to high cardiomyogenic efficiency. Equivalent to mPSCs, timed EBIO supplementation during hPSC differentiation resulted in dose-dependent enrichment of up to 80% CMs, including an increase in nodal- and atrial-like phenotypes. However, our study revealed extensive EBIO-triggered cell loss favoring cardiac progenitor preservation and, subsequently, CMs with shortened action potentials. Proliferative cells were generally more sensitive to EBIO, presumably via an SK-independent mechanism. Together, EBIO did not promote cardiogenic differentiation of PSCs, opposing previous findings, but triggered lineage-selective survival at a cardiac progenitor stage, which we propose as a pharmacological strategy to modulate CM subtype composition.

Abstract: Inflammatory modulation mediated by microglial M1/M2 polarization is one of the main pathophysiological processes involved in early brain injury (EBI) after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Previous studies have shown that recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) alleviates EBI following experimental SAH. However, the mechanisms of this beneficial effect are still poorly understood. Recent research has suggested that EPO shows anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, we tried to analyse whether rhEPO administration influenced microglial M1/M2 polarization in early brain injury after SAH and to identify the underlying molecular mechanism of any such effect. We found that treatment with rhEPO markedly ameliorated SAH-induced EBI, as shown by reductions in brain cell apoptosis, neuronal necrosis, albumin exudation and brain edema. Moreover, the expression levels of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were significantly increased in the cortex after SAH induction and were further increased by EPO treatment; in addition, the p-JAK2 inhibitor AZD1480 impaired the protective effect of EPO against SAH-induced EBI in vivo. Furthermore, EPO promoted the polarization of microglia towards the protective M2 phenotype and alleviated inflammation. In cultured microglia under oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) treatment, EPO up-regulated the expression of the EPO receptor (EPOR), which did not occur in response to OxyHb treatment alone, and EPO magnified OxyHb-induced increases in p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 and modulated OxyHb-challenged microglial polarization towards M2. Interestingly, the effect of EPO on microglia polarization was cancelled by EPOR knockdown or by p-JAK2 or p-STAT3 inhibition, suggesting a core role of the EPOR/JAK2/STAT3 pathway in modulating microglial function and phenotype. In conclusion, the therapeutic effect of rhEPO on the early brain injury after SAH may relate to its modulation of inflammatory response and microglia M1/M2 polarization, which may be mediated in part by the EPOR/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway. These results improved the understanding of the anti-inflammatory effect of EPO on microglia polarization, which might optimize the therapeutic modalities of EPO treatment with SAH.

Adipogenic miR-27a in adipose tissue upregulates macrophage activation via inhibiting PPARγ of insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet-associated obesity,

Abstract: Chronic low degree inflammation caused by macrophage activation is a crucial factor underlying insulin resistance induced by obesity. To illustrate the mechanism of regulating of macrophage activation in adipose tissue, the role of adipogenic miR-27a activating M1 macrophage polarization via blocking PPARγ was evaluated. Obese mice model and miR-27a overexpression or knockdown mice model were established and related biochemical index were examined. Raw264.7 and 3T3-L1 were cultured and co-cultured for mimicking the microenvironment of local inflammation. Macrophage infiltration was observed. MiR-27a and cytokines levels in serum and adipose tissue were measured. Macrophage polarization markers and protein expression in insulin or inflammatory signaling pathways were observed. Impaired glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance was observed in 4w, 8w and 12w of high fat diet and miR-27a overexpression mice. Concurrently, miR-27a was increased in serum in a time-dependent manner, along with M1 cytokines and M1 macrophages increasing in adipose tissue clearly. Insulin signaling pathway was blocked, and PPARγ was suppressed. However, NF-κB was activated. On the other hand, activated macrophages and hypertrophic adipocytes induced by miR-27a could increase the ratio of Raw264.7 migration, including improving cytokines generation, and blocking PPARγ expression markedly. The present studies are conducted to clarify that miR-27a has increased along with up-regulation in the process of proinflammatory cytokines generation, macrophage influx and M1 macrophage polarization in obesity. These indicate that miR-27a gives the novel target of intervention for inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity.

Abstract: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare monogenic hemorrhagic disorder involving aggregation defect of non-nuclear platelets. In this study we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from skin fibroblasts of a GT patient with complex heterogeneous mutations of ITGA2B gene. GT-iPSCs could be successfully differentiated into platelets (GT-iPS-platelets). GT-iPS-platelets were CD41−/CD42b+/CD61− and were platelet activation marker (PAC-1) negative after adenosine diphosphate (ADP) activation. Furthermore, GT-iPS-platelets were defective in platelet aggregation tests in vitro. Moreover, exogenous expression of the wild-type ITGA2B gene in GT-iPS platelets restored CD41 expression and normal platelet aggregation. Our study suggested that patient-specific iPSCs could be a potential target of stem cell based gene therapy for platelet diseases.

Abstract: There are many different correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) techniques available. The use of super-resolution microscopy in CLEM is an emerging application and while offering the obvious advantages of improved resolution in the fluorescence image, and therefore more precise correlation to electron microscopy (EM) ultrastructure, it also presents new challenges. Choice of fluorophore, method of fixation, and timing of the fluorescence imaging are critical to the success of super-resolution CLEM and the relative importance, and technical difficulty, of each of these factors depends on the type of super-resolution microscopy being employed. This chapter details the method we developed for in-resin super-resolution CLEM using single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) with standard fluorescent proteins (e.g., GFP and mVenus). The key to this approach is being able to preserve not only the fluorescence, but also, and more importantly, the photoswitching ability of the fluorescent proteins throughout the EM sample preparation procedure. Cells are cryofixed using high pressure freezing for optimal structural preservation and then freeze substituted in tannic acid, which preserves the photoswitching ability of the fluorescent proteins and is essential for high-quality SMLM imaging. Resin sections are then imaged using SMLM, achieving a structural resolution of 40–50nm and a localization precision of ∼17nm, followed by transmission electron microscopy. This produces high quality correlative images without the use of specialized fluorescent proteins or antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
The syncytiotrophoblast layer is the most critical and prominent tissue in placenta. SynT cells are differentiated from trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) during early embryogenesis. Mouse TSCs can spontaneously differentiate into cells of mixed lineages in vitro upon withdrawal of stemness-maintaining factors. However, differentiation into defined placental cell lineages remains challenging. We report here that canonical Wnt signaling activation robustly induces expression of SynT-II lineage-specific genes Gcm1 and SynB and suppresses markers of other placental lineages. In contrast to mouse TSCs, the induced SynT-II cells are migratory. More importantly, the migration depends on hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the c-MET signaling axis. Furthermore, HGF-expressing cells lie adjacent to SynT-II cells in developing murine placenta, suggesting that HGF/c-MET signaling plays a critical role in SynT-II cell morphogenesis during the labyrinth branching process. The availability of SynT-II cells in vitro will facilitate molecular understanding of labyrinth layer development.

Abstract: Cancer stem cells (CSC) are considered the major cause of aggressive tumor behavior, recurrence, metastases, and resistance to radiation, making them an attractive therapeutic target. However, isolation of CSC from tumor tissue and their characterization are challenging due to uncertainty about their molecular markers and conditions for their propagation. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), which arises predominantly in the salivary glands, is a slow-growing but relentless tumor that frequently invades nerves and metastasizes. New effective treatment approaches for ACC have not emerged over the last 40years. Previously, based on a highly conserved SOX10 gene signature that we identified in the majority of ACC tumors, we suggested the existence in ACC of SOX10+ cells with neural stem properties and corroborated this hypothesis via isolation from ACC tissue a novel population of CSC, termed ACC-CSC. These cells activated NOTCH1 signaling and co-expressed SOX10 and other ACC-intrinsic neural crest stem cell markers with CD133, a CSC cell surface marker, suggesting that ACC is driven by a previously uncharacterized population of SOX10+/CD133+ cells with neural stem cell properties. Here, we authenticated ACC identity of our primary cultures by demonstrating that most of them harbor MYB-NFIB fusions, which are found in 86% of ACC. We demonstrated using CyTOF, a novel mass cytometry technology, that these cells express high β-catenin and STAT3 levels and are marked by CD24 and CD44. Finally, to streamline development of ACC cell lines, we developed RT-PCR tests for distinguishing mouse and human cells and used immunomagnetic cell sorting to eliminate mouse cells from long-term cell cultures. Overall, this study describes a new population of CSC that activates signaling pathways associated with poor prognosis, validates their ACC identity, and optimizes approaches that can be used for purification of ACC-CSC and generation of cell lines.

Abstract: Summary
Recent evidence points to the embryonic emergence of some tissue-resident innate immune cells, such as B-1a lymphocytes, prior to and independently of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, whether the full hematopoietic repertoire of embryonic HSCs initially includes these unique lineages of innate immune cells has been difficult to assess due to lack of clonal assays that identify and assess HSC precursor (pre-HSC) potential. Here, by combining index sorting of single embryonic hemogenic precursors with in vitro HSC maturation and transplantation assays, we analyze emerging pre-HSCs at the single-cell level, revealing their unique stage-specific properties and clonal lineage potential. Remarkably, clonal pre-HSCs detected between E9.5 and E11.5 contribute to the complete B cell repertoire, including B-1a lymphocytes, revealing a previously unappreciated common precursor for all B cell lineages at the pre-HSC stage and a second embryonic origin for B-1a lymphocytes.

Abstract: Summary
The polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2) are two distinct polycomb group (PcG) proteins that maintain the stable silencing of specific sets of genes through chromatin modifications. Although the PRC2 component EZH2 has been known as an epigenetic regulator in promoting the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), the regulatory network that controls this process remains largely unknown. Here we show that miR-203 is repressed by EZH2 in both embryonic and adult NSPCs. MiR-203 negatively regulates the proliferation of NSPCs. One of PRC1 components, Bmi1, is a downstream target of miR-203 in NSPCs. Conditional knockout of Ezh2 results in decreased proliferation ability of both embryonic and adult NSPCs. Meanwhile, ectopic overexpression of BMI1 rescues the proliferation defects exhibited by miR-203 overexpression or EZH2 deficiency in NSPCs. Therefore, this study provides evidence for coordinated function of the EZH2-miR-203-BMI1 regulatory axis that regulates the proliferation of NSPCs.

Abstract: Summary
The bactericidal lectin RegIIIβ is inducibly produced by intestinal epithelial cells as a defense against infection by enteropathogens. In the gut lumen, RegIIIβ kills not only certain enteropathogens, but also some commensal bacteria; thus, RegIIIβ is also thought to be an innate immune effector shaping microbiota composition and establishing intestinal homeostasis. Using the streptomycin mouse model for Salmonella colitis, we show that RegIIIβ can promote sustained gut colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium and prolong enteropathy. RegIIIβ expression was associated with suppression of Bacteroides spp. in the gut lumen, prolonged disease-associated alterations in colonic metabolism, and reduced luminal vitamin B6 levels. Supplementation with Bacteroides spp. or vitamin B6 accelerated pathogen clearance from the gut and remission of enteropathy. Our findings indicate that interventions at the level of RegIIIβ and supplementation with Bacteroides spp. or vitamin B6 might open new avenues for therapeutic intervention in the context of Salmonella colitis.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming of differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem cells has been recently achieved in vivo in mice. Telomeres are essential for chromosomal stability and determine organismal life span as well as cancer growth. Here, we study whether tissue dedifferentiation induced by in vivo reprogramming involves changes at telomeres. We find telomerase-dependent telomere elongation in the reprogrammed areas. Notably, we found highly upregulated expression of the TRF1 telomere protein in the reprogrammed areas, which was independent of telomere length. Moreover, TRF1 inhibition reduced in vivo reprogramming efficiency. Importantly, we extend the finding of TRF1 upregulation to pathological tissue dedifferentiation associated with neoplasias, in particular during pancreatic acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, a process that involves transdifferentiation of adult acinar cells into ductal-like cells due to K-Ras oncogene expression. These findings place telomeres as important players in cellular plasticity both during in vivo reprogramming and in pathological conditions associated with increased plasticity, such as cancer.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, evolutionarily conserved small non-coding RNA molecules that mediate the posttranscriptional process of target gene, leading to translational repression or degradation of target mRNAs. A series of studies have indicated that miRNAs play an important role in tumor initiation, development and progression. In this study, we found that down regulation of miR-598 was a frequent event in CRC tissues compared to the paracarcinoma tissues. And the study demonstrated that miR-598 was implicated in CRC metastasis. Transwell migration assay revealed that elevated miR-598 expression reduces CRC cell migration. Moreover, our study showed that suppression of miR-598 expression induces CRC cell epithelialmesenchymal transition(EMT) and overexpression of miR-598 inhibits CRC cell EMT. In addition, bioinformatics target prediction identified JAG1 as a putative target of miR-598. Knockdown of miR-598 was shown to upregulate JAG1 expression. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-598 suppressed the expression of JAG1. Consistent results were also obtained when the regulation of JAG1 expression by miR-598 was further specified in CRC tissues. Moreover, overexpression of JAG1 induces epithelialmesenchymal transition(EMT) and promotes the metastasis of CRC cells. Decreased Notch2 expression suppresses CRC cells metastasis and EMT. Together, these results indicate that miR-598 is a novel regulator of colorectal cancer metastasis. Our data suggest miR-598 is implicated in regulating Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions by directly suppressing its downstream target gene JAG1 to inactivate Notch signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The irreversibility of developmental processes in mammalian cells has been challenged by rising evidence that de-differentiation of hepatocytes occurs in adult liver. However, whether reversibility exists in mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived hepatocytes (dHeps) remains elusive. In this study, we find that hepatogenic differentiation (HD) of MSCs is a reversible process and is modulated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNMTs are regulated by transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), which in turn controls hepatogenic differentiation and de-differentiation. In addition, a stepwise reduction in TGFβ1 concentrations in culture media increases DNMT1 and decreases DNMT3 in primary hepatocytes (Heps) and confers Heps with multi-differentiation potentials similarly to MSCs. Hepatic lineage reversibility of MSCs and lineage conversion of Heps are regulated by DNMTs in response to TGFβ1. This previously unrecognized TGFβ1-DNMTs-MSC-HD axis may further increase the understanding the normal and pathological processes in the liver, as well as functions of MSCs after transplantation to treat liver diseases.

Abstract: Summary
A method to maintain and rebuild ureteric bud (UB)-like structures from UB cells in vitro could provide a useful tool for kidney regeneration. We aimed in our present study to establish a serum-free culture system that enables the expansion of UB progenitor cells, i.e., UB tip cells, and reconstruction of UB-like structures. We found that fibroblast growth factors or retinoic acid (RA) was sufficient for the survival of UB cells in serum-free condition, while the proliferation and maintenance of UB tip cells required glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor together with signaling from either WNT-β-catenin pathway or RA. The activation of WNT-β-catenin signaling in UB cells by endogenous WNT proteins required R-spondins. Together with Rho kinase inhibitor, our culture system facilitated the expansion of UB tip cells to form UB-like structures from dispersed single cells. The UB-like structures thus formed retained the original UB characteristics and integrated into the native embryonic kidneys.
