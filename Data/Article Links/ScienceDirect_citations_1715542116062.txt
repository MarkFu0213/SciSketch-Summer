Abstract: Thermochromic (TC) vanadium dioxide thin films provide means for controlling solar energy throughput and can be used for energy-saving applications such as smart windows. One of the factors limiting the deployment of VO2 films in TC devices is the growth temperature τs. At present, temperatures in excess of 450°C are required, which clearly can be an impediment especially for temperature-sensitive substrates. Here we address the issue of high τs by synthesizing VO2 thin films from highly ionized fluxes of depositing species generated in high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) discharges. The use of ions facilitates low-temperature film growth because the energy of the depositing species can be readily manipulated by substrate bias. For comparison, films were also synthesized by pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering. Structural and optical characterization of VO2 thin films on ITO-coated glass substrates confirms previous results that HiPIMS allows τs to be reduced from ~500 to ~300°C. Importantly, we demonstrated that HiPIMS permits the composition and TC response of the films to be tuned by altering the energy of the deposition flux via substrate bias. An optimum ion energy of 100eV was identified, which points at a potential for further reduction of τs thereby opening new possibilities for industrially-relevant applications of VO2-based TC thin films. Weak TC activity was observed even at τs≈200°C in HiPIMS-produced films.

Abstract: Here we demonstrate the enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance and photocatalytic activity towards water oxidation of n-type SrTiO3 (STO) nanocubes coupled with p-type NiO nanoparticles (denoted as p-NiO@n-STO nanoparticle@nanocube), fabricated by calcining Ni(NO3)2-loaded STO nanocubes. High resolution transmission electron microscope studies show that intimate p–n junctions are formed between n-type STO and p-type NiO interfaces. As a p–n junction photoanode, the p-NiO@n-STO nanoparticle@nanocube nanostructures exhibit the enhanced PEC activity and photocatalytic water oxidation. The photocurrent density of the p-NiO@n-STO nanostructure electrode reaches 3.5µAcm−2, which is 7 times higher than that (0.5µAcm−2) for pure STO nanocube electrode at 0V versus Ag/AgCl. The p-NiO@n-STO nanoparticle@nanocube nanostructures also exhibit pronounced photoresponse to generate O2. The O2 generation is about 100µmol after irradiation 3h with a 300-W Xenon lamp, which is about 1.7 times higher than that (60µmol) of pure STO nanocubes. The intimate p–n junctions between p-NiO and n-STO interfaces accelerate holes migration from valence band of n-STO to that of p-NiO and reduction of the recombination of electron–hole pairs by the internal electrostatic field in the interface, which are believed to be the main reasons for enhanced PEC response and water-splitting performance of the as-prepared p-NiO@n-STO nanoparticle@nanocube nanostructures. The present work demonstrates that the p–n junction p-NiO@n-STO heterostructures have great potential applications in the field of photoelectrical devices and photocatalysis for water splitting.

Abstract: Infrared to visible upconversion (UC) is a promising way to enhance the efficiency of silicon based solar cells. In this paper, the spectral conversion and recovery of sub-band gap photons of the solar spectrum, from NIR-IR to the VIS-NIR wavelength region, is investigated in two fluorides hosts doped with trivalent erbium ions (Er3+). The efficiency gain due to upconversion in silicon solar cells is compared for single crystal samples of BaY2F8:Er3+ and LiYF4:Er3+ in a dedicated upconverter solar cell device (UCSCD) with monochromatic excitation in the 1.5µm spectral region. The highest external quantum efficiency due to upconversion was found for the UCSCD using the BaY2F8:30at% Er3+ single crystal, reaching an EQE of 6.8±0.2% for (1.10±0.12)·105Wm−2 spectral irradiance at 1494nm. We present a comprehensive spectroscopic study of the crystal samples also taking into account the effects of the different crystal symmetry as well as the different phonon energies. Our findings enable us to explain the higher efficiency of the BaY2F8:Er3+ compared to the LiYF4:Er3+ upconverter in terms of both static and dynamic properties.

Abstract: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an orphan progressive neurodevelopmental disease affecting almost exclusively females (frequency 1:10,000). RTT clinical expression is typically characterized by loss of purposeful hand movements, severe mental retardation and motor impairment, breathing disorders, ataxia and increased risk of sudden death. Although the main genetic cause, i.e. mutation in the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2), has been already identified, the molecular and pathogenic mechanisms by which MECP2 deficiency drives pathology in RTT remains not fully understood. A wealth of evidence from our and other laboratories suggests a potential causal relationship between MECP2 dysfunction and systemic redox imbalance, a condition that has been widely found in association with RTT. In turn, a “short-circuit” of redox pathways may contribute to the systemic immune dysfunction expressed as cytokines/chemokines dysregulation, a feature clearly emerged from two recent studies on RTT patients. In this light, the purpose of this review is to describe and to stimulate a new discussion on the idea that systemic subclinical inflammation and oxidative stress are crucial players of a detrimental vicious circle, driving the pathogenesis and clinical course of RTT.

Abstract: We report fabrication of nanostructured, laser-doped selective emitter (LDSE) silicon solar cells with power conversion efficiency of 18.1% and a fill factor (FF) of 80.1%. The nanostructured solar cells were realized through a single step, mask-less, scalable reactive ion etch (RIE) texturing of the surface. The selective emitter was formed by means of laser doping using a continuous wave (CW) laser and subsequent contact formation using light-induced plating of Ni and Cu. The combination of RIE-texturing and a LDSE cell design has to our knowledge not been demonstrated previously. The resulting efficiency indicates a promising potential, especially considering that the cell reported in this work is the first proof-of-concept and that the fabricated cell is not fully optimized in terms of plating, emitter sheet resistance and surface passivation. Due to the scalable nature and simplicity of RIE-texturing as well as the LDSE process, we consider this specific combination a promising candidate for a cost-efficient process for future Si solar cells.

Abstract: As an important type of somatic cell, granulosa cells play a major role in deciding the fate of follicles. Therefore, analyses of granulosa cell apoptosis and follicular atresia have become hotspots of animal research. Autophagy is a cellular catabolic mechanism that protects cells from stress conditions, including starvation, hypoxia, and accumulation of misfolded proteins. However, the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in granulosa cells is not well known. Here, we demonstrate that let-7g regulates the mouse granulosa cell autophagy signaling pathway by inhibiting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor expression and affecting the phosphorylation of protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin. Small interference-mediated knockdown of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor significantly promoted autophagy signaling of mouse granulosa cells. In contrast, overexpression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor in mouse granulosa cells attenuated autophagy activity in the presence of let-7g. In addition, overexpression of let-7g increased the apoptosis rate, as indicated by an increased number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells. Finally, 3-methyladenine as well as the lysosomal enzyme inhibitor chloroquine partially blocked apoptosis. In summary, this study demonstrates that let-7g regulates autophagy in mouse granulosa cells by targeting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and downregulating protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, and that mouse granulosa cell autophagy induced by let-7g participates in apoptosis.

Abstract: In this work we establish a device model in SCAPS, incorporating bandgap narrowing, short minority carrier diffusion length and interface recombination. The model is based on a reference device with standard structure; sputtered Mo on soda lime glass, a reactively sputtered and annealed Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) absorber layer, chemical bath deposited CdS and sputtered i-ZnO buffer layers, and front contact formed with sputtered ZnO:Al and an evaporated Ni/Al/Ni grid. The efficiency of the reference device is 6.7%. Model parameter values of the absorber layer are based on the analysis of temperature dependent current–voltage (J–V–T) measurements, capacitance–voltage (C–V) and drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) measurements, performed on the reference device, and on the comparison of simulated and measured quantum efficiency (QE) and current–voltage (J–V) performance. Additional parameters are taken from literature. The key elements, electron–hole pair generation and recombination in the absorber layer, are the main focus in this study. Reported values of the absorption coefficient of CZTS vary around one order of magnitude when comparing data from reflectance–transmission (R–T) measurements with ellipsometry measurements, and calculations. Therefore, a modified semi-empirical absorption coefficient, extracted from R–T and QE measurements, with the depletion width from CV and DLCP, is presented and used in this study. The dominating recombination path is evaluated with J–V–T analysis and the zero Kelvin activation energy (EA,0) is extracted from both temperature dependent open circuit voltage (VOC) and from modified Arrhenius plots. In each case,EA,0is found to be substantially smaller than the bandgap energy, even when considering bandgap narrowing due to disorder, which is an indication that the VOCdeficit observed in our CZTS device dominated by interface recombination. Finally, a complete device model is established, with J–V and QE simulations in good agreement with corresponding measurements, where the interface has the biggest impact on the VOCdeficit, but with clear contribution from bulk recombination, with minority carrier diffusion length 250nm, and from bandgap narrowing, giving a lower than nominal bandgap energy of 1.35eV.

Abstract: Metallisation of phosphorus-doped silicon (Si) surfaces using screen-printed silver (Ag) pastes is a well-established process and also a key process in the production of Si wafer solar cells. The metal-Si interface in a solar cell is a highly recombination-active region that impacts the device voltage. In this work, a facile test metallisation pattern with regions of varying front metal contact fractions is screen printed to create test cells on different phosphorus emitter doping profiles, all on commercially available multicrystalline Si wafers. On these and in conjunction with H-pattern cells and cells without front metallisation, intensity-dependent photoluminescence imaging is performed to extract both the metal-induced recombination saturation current densities and parameters related to wafer edge and peripheral recombination. It is observed that as the phosphorus emitter profile becomes lightly doped and shallower, the metallisation-induced recombination losses increase. The extracted metal recombination saturation current densities (J01-metal and J02-metal) on a 50Ω/sq phosphorus emitter surface were 1800fA/cm2 and 10nA/cm2 respectively when compared to values of 2500fA/cm2 and 120nA/cm2 respectively on a 130Ω/sq phosphorus emitter surface. As a consequence of high metal recombination current density values for the lightly doped emitters of this study (130Ω/sq), the solar cells fabricated from this group have a significant drop of 12mV in open-circuit voltage values after front grid metallisation.

Abstract: The use of nanofluids as working fluids in direct absorption solar collector is growing up and the study of optical properties of nanoparticles is an important step for the success of this new technology. In this paper we report optical absorption measurements performed on several metal oxide nanoparticles (ZnO, CeO2, and Fe2O3) as a function of temperature in the range 25–500°C, in order to study their optical properties, and to investigate how several heating cycles could affect nanoparticle structural stability and absorption characteristics. These are quite important issues to be investigated in order to assess the possibility to use such metal-oxide nanoparticles as gas-based high temperature nanofluid in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP).

Abstract: The change in reflectivity of black-Si (b-Si) upon optical excitation was measured by the pump-probe technique using picosecond laser pulses at 532 (pump) and 1064nm (probe) wavelengths. The specular reflection from the random pattern of plasma-etched b-Si nano-needles was dominated by the photo-excited free-carrier contribution to the reflectivity. The kinetics of the reflectivity were found to be consistent with surface structural and chemical analysis, performed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The surface recombination velocity on the b-Si needles was estimated to be ~102cm/s. Metalization of b-Si led to much faster recombination and alteration of reflectivity. The reflectivity spectra of random b-Si surfaces with different needle lengths was modeled by a multi-step refractive index profile in the Drude formalism. The dip in the reflectivity spectra and the sign reversal in the differential reflectivity signal at certain b-Si needle sizes is explained by the model.

Abstract: During the past decade, most governments have been promoting energy efficiency programs and the integration of renewable energy sources into the majority of energy uses. Among the different sectors, the agricultural sector is becoming a more active participant to reduce fossil fuel dependence and improve environmental sustainability. Indeed, agriculture usually combines both a high energy demand and water problems associated with over-exploited aquifers, providing great potential and remarkable opportunities to change the energy mix and maximize the use and integration of natural resources in a rational way. Considering this framework, the present paper describes and compares the solar resource integration and its effects on agricultural pumping purposes in two Mediterranean countries, Spain and Morocco, with significant differences in terms of energy mix, climatic conditions and energy policies. As a novel contribution in this paper, we propose the use of GIS to analyze the spatial and temporal variability of the solar resource through real data of both locations, as well as to study groundwater resources. With this aim, two technical proposals for irrigation purposes are compared in terms of environmental benefits, CO2 emissions and agriculture energy model changes: diesel equipment and photovoltaic system. Results based on solar radiation resource, pumping requirements and aquifer depth are included in the paper.

Abstract: Olive-green few-layered BiOI with expanded spacing of the (001) facets and oxygen vacancy is successfully synthesized and characterized. The experimental analysis and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the expanded facets spacing and oxygen vacancy of few-layered BiOI result in enhanced separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers and photon absorption efficiency. Therefore, few-layered BiOI shows much higher photocatalytic activity for CO2 conversion than that of bulk BiOI under visible or near-infrared (NIR) light. And the apparent quantum yields (AQY) are 0.14% and 0.02% for few-layered BiOI under 420 and 700nm monochromatic light irradiation, respectively. These findings deep our understanding of few-layered BiOX (X=Cl,Br,I) photocatalysts, and propose a new route to design high efficient photocatalysts for energy and environmental photocatalysis.

Abstract: Encapsulant discoloration is a common type of degradation in photovoltaic (PV) modules, which significantly affects its performance and reliability under field conditions. This paper presents the nondestructive characterization techniques for investigation of encapsulant discoloration in crystalline-silicon PV modules. These characterization techniques have been channelized and applied to investigate various aspects of discoloration effects on 20 years old field-exposed PV modules. Dark lock-in thermography (DLIT) has been exploited for investigation of temperature variation and defects caused by uneven discoloration over the cells, while electroluminescence (EL) imaging has been proposed for relative quantification of extent of discoloration in a PV module. The spatially-resolved images obtained from both the techniques provided the qualitative and quantitative information about the optical and electrical effects of discoloration in a module, which is not possible by the conventional visual inspection method alone. The electrical methods including proposed differential current analysis, I–V measurement and insulation resistance test have also been used to aid this investigation. The results obtained from these techniques show that the power degradation due to discoloration was attributed to significant reduction in fill factor by non-uniform discoloration and increase in series resistance of cell contacts, and to some extent by its direct effect of light reduction. Electrical mismatch appeared to play an important role in accelerating the encapsulant discoloration in the module. These nondestructive characterization approaches can enable to inspect large number of PV modules in their actual encapsulated form by fast and efficient manner.

Abstract: The CuPtB ordering and the antiphase boundaries (APBs) in GaInP2 epifilms were found to be diminished by the addition of the surfactant antimony (Sb) during the epitaxy. This is evidenced by the disappearance of the APBs related deep level peak in the Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, as well as the significantly increased lifetime of the minority carriers. The GaInP2/metamorphic (MM)-GaInAs/Ge multi-junction solar cells made by this method possess enhanced short circuit current density and show a narrower distribution of the open circuit voltage. We believe the use of surfactant Sb to control APBs during the growth of InGaP2 would be very useful for designing GaInP2-based devices, such as solar cells, laser diodes and light-emitting diodes.

Abstract: Thermal annealing of photoanodes made of TiO2 nanotubes sensitized with CdSe quantum dots is studied. Heat treatment of these photoanodes in air can cause either an improvement or a serious drop in the photocurrent generation. Ligands or capping agents stabilize Qdots removing highly reactive dangling bonds on its surface but also they can act as a passivating layer that increases charge transfer resistance between Qdots and TiO2 nanotubes; therefore optimal conditions of thermal annealing are needed to improve efficiency of the interfacial charge transfer avoiding as far as possible the decomposition of the sensitizers. As a corollary of this study, a 2.5-fold increase in photocurrent value was reached after thermal annealing at 200°C during at least two hours; while thermal treatments at temperature values higher than 250°C can produce a deleterious effect on the conversion efficiency if the annealing time extends over a long period of time. Photoelectrochemistry, thermogravimetry and SEM microscopy were used as tools to propose a mechanism able to explain the observed behaviour.

Abstract: Bi2S3 is a promising inorganic material for thin film photovoltaic application with optimum direct band gap of ~1.3eV, strong absorption coefficient, nontoxic and simple composition. Here we introduce rapid thermal evaporation (RTE), a method with simple facility and extremely fast deposition speed, to produce high quality Bi2S3 films. By optimizing the substrate temperature and post-annealing process, well-crystalline, smooth and compact Bi2S3 films were obtained. The band gap, doping type and density, and photosensitivity of as-produced Bi2S3 films were revealed by a combined X-ray diffraction, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectrum, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Hall effect and photoresponse measurements. Finally, a prototypical ITO/NiO/Bi2S3/Au solar cell with 0.75% power conversion efficiency was obtained, manifesting the promise of Bi2S3 as the absorber layer for thin film photovoltaics.

Abstract: In this work we report, for the first time at room temperature, experimental results that prove, simultaneously in the same device, the two main physical principles involved in the operation of intermediate band solar cells: (1) the production of sub-bandgap photocurrent by two optical transitions through the intermediate band; (2) the generation of an output voltage which is not limited by the photon energy absorption threshold. These principles, which had always required cryogenic temperatures to be evidenced all together, are now demonstrated at room temperature on an intermediate band solar cell based on InAs quantum dots with Al0.3Ga0.7As barriers.

Abstract: Al–N cermet solar selective coatings with double absorbing layers were deposited on Al substrates via a home-made DC magnetron sputter system. The as-deposited coatings showed a high solar absorptance of 0.942 and a normal emittance of 0.066 at 80°C. Thermal accelerated aging tests results showed that the coatings are durable for at least 25 years. Neutral salt spray test showed that the coating presents excellent corrosion stability because the optical performance (absorptance and emittance) of the coating remained almost unchanged after a 200h test. The structural, chemical, and optical evolution of the coatings with heat treatment in air was comprehensively investigated. Our research clearly indicated that the as-deposited double cermet layer Al–AlN solar absorber coatings can be used for solar-thermal flat plate collectors. Furthermore, we obtained different colored Al–AlN cermet coatings in a wide range only by tuning the thickness of the Al–AlN (LMVF) and AlN anti-reflective (AR) layers, while maintaining high absorptance (>0.90) and low emittance (<0.10). These coatings are colored blue, purple, red, yellowish orange, and yellow, can be easily produced via a commercial production process, and are suitable for building integration solar energy saving systems.

Abstract: A cadmium sulfide (CdS) layer with a thickness of 37±5nm is deposited onto a Cu2ZnSn(SSe)4 absorber layer using Cd(NO3)2 precursor at pH 11.8 via chemical bath deposition. Full devices fabricated with the thin CdS layer show improved champion efficiency of 6.97%, compared with the 5.91% efficiency of the control device, which can be attributed to the increased current density from reduced light reflection in the visible region and enhanced charge collection in the shorter wavelength region.

Abstract: Mixed halide perovskites CH3NH3Pb(I1−xBrx)3 thin films were successfully fabricated by spin coating using a precursor solution obtained by reacting a (1:1) molar ratio of methyl-ammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and lead bromide (PbBr2). The films obtained by this one step process were used to fabricate a solar cell using an aluminum-doped Zinc oxide (Al–ZnO) thin film as an electron selective layer. The Al–ZnO films were fabricated by RF sputtering on indium-tin-oxide (ITO) covered glass substrates. The structural and optical properties of the films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy. The mixed halide pervoskite films were polycrystalline with an optical band gap of 1.85eV. Al–ZnO/perovskite solar cells were fabricated without a hole-selective layer by directly deposition silver (Ag) contacts on the perovskite films. The electrical properties of the cells were investigated by current–voltage (I–V) measurements. The devices showed an open circuit voltage of 0.12V, a fill factor of 0.29 and conversion efficiency of 1.6% under an illumination of 480mWcm−2. The film and cells are stable under ambient atmosphere as revealed by the absence of any changes in their color.

Abstract: Porous ceramic materials are currently used as volumetric sunlight absorbers in concentrating solar power systems. As the efficiency of thermodynamic cycles rapidly increases with the operating temperature, the favorable characteristics of so-called ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) can be successfully exploited in novel solar absorbers. The present work reports, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, on optical properties and microstructural analysis of novel ice-templating porous ZrB2 UHTCs, to evaluate their potential as volumetric solar receivers. We demonstrate that the different complex structures that can be obtained with the freeze casting technique show promising optical properties. The idea of conjugating an highly tailorable morphology, useful for optimizing gas fluxes and heat exchanges between absorber and gas, to the spectral selectivity which is a characteristics of ZrB2 can be a promising route for increasing the efficiency of thermal solar systems.

Abstract: The impact of using thin GaAs(Sb)(N) capping layers (CLs) on InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) is investigated for their application in solar cell devices. We demonstrate the ability to combine strain-balancing techniques with band engineering approaches through the application of such CLs. Extended photoresponse is attainable by means of an independent tunability of the electron and hole confinements in the QD. Moreover, the CL acts itself as a quantum well (QW), providing an additional photoresponse, so that the devices work as hybrid QD–QW solar cells. The use of a GaAsSb CL is particularly beneficial, providing devices with efficiencies under AM1.5 conditions 20% higher than standard GaAs-capped QDs. This is mainly due to a significant increase in photocurrent beyond the GaAs bandgap, leading to an enhanced short-circuit current density (Jsc). The addition of N to the CLs, however, produces a strong reduction in Jsc. This is found to be related to carrier collection problems, namely, hindered electron extraction and retrapping in the CLs. Nevertheless, the application of reverse biases induces a release of the trapped carriers assisted by a sequential tunneling mechanism. In the case of GaAsN CLs, this leads to a complete carrier collection and reveals an even higher QD–QW-related photocurrent than when using a GaAsSb CL. The hindered carrier collection is stronger in the case of the quaternary CLs, likely due to the faster recombination rates in the type-I GaAsSbN/GaAs QW structure as compared to the type-II ternary counterparts. Nevertheless, alternative approaches, such as the use of a thinner CL or a short-period superlattice CL, lead to significant improvements, demonstrating a great potential for the quaternary CLs under a proper device design.

Abstract: We present the preparation and characterization of solution processed lead free films of zero-dimensional methylammonium iodo bismuthate (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 perovskite. Structural characterization reveals the formation of hexagonal micro-crystals with preferred growth orientation along the c-axis. The material exhibits a wide band gap of 2.9eV and upon optical excitation the photoluminescence emission is observed at 1.65eV (751nm). Photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the stoichiometry of the (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 perovskite and yields an ionization energy of 6.24eV, while Raman spectra confirm the vibrational modes of the bioctahedral inorganic anion framework (Bi2I9)3− in the low wavenumber regime (<200cm−1) regime. Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) are employed to evaluate the experimental results. We apply this novel bismuth-based hybrid perovskite in proof of principle simple heterojunction solar cell devices, which yield power conversion efficiencies of ~0.1%. Further enhancement is expected once the film morphology and device stack are optimized.

Abstract: Cu is a well-known cause for degradation of CdTe solar cells, yet, the exact mechanisms remain subject of discussion. We have chosen a novel approach to study CdTe solar cell stability by preparing CdTe solar cells in substrate configuration and applying a minimum amount of Cu to CdTe after recrystallization. These cells were exposed to an accelerated stress test. After 1000h of operation at maximum power point under 1 sun illumination intensity at 80°C substrate temperature such devices showed 90% of their initial power output indicating good performance stability. In order to investigate the remaining degradation and understand the role of Cu the Cu distribution in the multilayer stack was analyzed by SIMS before and after accelerated stress testing. We found that neither Cu loss in the back contact nor Cu accumulation in the CdS layer, which are often associated with degradation of CdTe solar cells, occurred in our case. C–V measurements revealed a decrease in net acceptor concentration by 70% and SCAPS simulations confirmed that this decrease can fully explain the observed performance losses of the solar cells. Time resolved photoluminescence measurements are consistent with the assumption that net acceptor loss upon stress is caused by a decay of acceptor type defects rather than by the formation of compensating donors. Acceptor loss can be explained by a redistribution of Cu inside the CdTe layer, possibly from within the grains to grain boundaries. The results demonstrate that by the use of a suitable Cu doping process that reduces Cu content at the back contact efficiency degradation due to Cu redistribution from back to front contact can be overcome. However, the observed acceptor loss appears in either configuration and seems to be independent of Cu movement from back to front or vice versa.

Abstract: The influence of superficial phosphorus-rich layers during the metallization firing treatment on carrier recombination and trapping in copper contaminated multicrystalline silicon was investigated. Copper contaminated wafers experienced firing steps with and without phosphorus-rich layers. The samples fired without phosphorus emitters feature higher bulk carrier lifetimes, but also a stronger sensitivity to the copper-related light-induced degradation (LID), which was activated by the firing treatment. This last behavior could be used to identify the dominant LID mechanism (boron-oxygen related or copper related) in multicrystalline wafers. In addition, only the samples fired without the phosphorus emitters are subjected to trapping effects, probably involving copper atoms initially precipitated. Copper precipitates are virulent recombination centers whereas the electrical activity of interstitial copper is benign. Therefore these experimental results suggest that on the one hand the wafers fired with the phosphorus-rich layers contain lower interstitial copper concentrations. On the other hand they would feature higher densities of copper precipitates and/or larger copper precipitates.

Abstract: The resistance to oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is a major obstacle to ideal therapeutic outcomes in colorectal cancer. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) induces tumor damage through photosensitizer-mediated oxidative cytotoxicity. Hypericin is a well-studied photosensitizer. In this study, we explored the role of hypericin-mediated PDT (HY-PDT) in sensitizing human colorectal cancer cells towards L-OHP. Pre-treatment with HY-PDT enhanced the anti-tumor activity of L-OHP via decreasing drug efflux and increasing platinum accumulation. Further research showed that HY-PDT-mediated resensitization of resistance cells towards L-OHP was dependent on regulation of MRP-2, instead of p-gp. HY-PDT was also found to inhibit intracellular glutathione (GSH) and Glutathione S-transferase (GST), suggesting the involvement of GSH-related detoxification in the sensitization effect. Additionally, enhanced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) was observed following HY-PDT/L-OHP combined treatment. HY-PDT lowered the removing rate of platinum from DNA and down-regulated the expression of ERCC1 and XPF, two critical enzymes involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. GSH monoethyl ester (GSH-EE) antagonized HY-PDT-induced ROS and repressed sensitization to platinum. Taken together, HY-PDT mediated sensitization of L-OHP in human colorectal cancer is mediated by ROS, whose mechanism involves affecting drug efflux, GSH-related detoxification and NER-mediated DNA repair.

Abstract: Understanding of the durability of each individual layer and their interfaces in a multilayered photovoltaic (PV) backsheet is critical to the design and selection of materials for making reliable and high performance PV modules. In this study, Raman imaging was used to depth profile the chemical degradation of a multilayer commercial backsheet film exposed to ultra-violet (UV) radiation at 85°C, 5% relative humidity (RH, dry) and 85°C, 60% RH (humid) on the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) SPHERE (Simulated Photodegradation via High Energy Radiant Exposure). The backsheet film was a multipart laminate comprising of a pigmented polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-based outer layer, PET core layer and three ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) layers having different vinyl acetate (VA) contents, along with two inner adhesive layers between PET outer and PET core layers, and PET core and EVA layers. Cross-sectional samples were prepared by cryo-microtomy for various characterizations. The multilayer structures were examined by laser scanning confocal and atomic force microscopies, while their chemical degradation profiles were obtained by Raman spectroscopic imaging. Non-uniform degradation was observed in the aged backsheet film, and both UV and moisture appeared to significantly affect the degradation profiles of the multilayers. Severe degradation, indicated by high fluorescence, occurred in the outermost region of the pigmented PET outer layer, and the degradation gradient extended to approximately 20µm to the bulk. It was also found that the inner adhesive layers were severely deteriorated under moist condition, indicating that the long-term adhesion between the layers could be a major area of concern for multilayer backsheets used in a humid environment. The relationship between the sharp (non-uniform) degradation profile, resultant internal stress, and ultimate failures (cracking and delamination) was discussed as well.

Abstract: Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is receiving increasing attention as a technology with the potential to provide clean electricity in a cost effective and dispatchable manner. Despite its renewable nature, solar power generation generates impacts that need to be adequately evaluated and managed. The objective of this paper is to estimate the socioeconomic and environmental life cycle impacts of the production of electricity by a commercial CSP plant using Multiregional Input Output Analysis. These effects have been estimated in terms of additional economic activity, value added, employment creation, climate change, acidification, photochemical oxidant formation and primary energy consumption. Additionally, the economic sectors and countries with higher effects in the value chain have been identified. The results are presented both in gross and net terms, including not only the effects of the system’s life cycle, but also the avoided effects derived from the displacement of other technologies in the Spanish electricity market. The effects of the displaced electricity have been calculated by estimating the Levelized Cost Of Energy of the mix of marginal technologies displaced by the CSP plant. The results indicate that producing electricity in a CSP plant and selling it into the Spanish electricity market results in net positive impacts on the economy, the employment and the environment both at a national and global scale. Taking into consideration the electricity technologies displaced by the CSP plant, the socioeconomic net effects amount to 167€/MWh of goods and services generated, 87.9€/MWh of value added and 4.67h/MWh of employment creation. The global and net environmental impacts on climate change, photochemical oxidant formation, acidification and primary energy consumption amount to −188kgeq CO2/MWh, 8geq NMVOC/MWh, −389geq SO2/MWh and −4169MJ/MWh, respectively, implying a net prevention of pollutant emissions and primary energy consumption.

Abstract: In order to favor electronic conductivity in sodium iron fluorophosphate electrodes for lithium- or sodium-ion batteries, composites of Na2FePO4F with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were prepared by pilot-scale spray drying. Addition of multi-walled CNTs in the solution results in an excellent dispersion of the CNTs within the volume of Na2FePO4F and not only at the surface of the particles. Following a heat treatment at 600°C in argon in order to reach crystallization, X-ray diffraction and ex situ Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed the presence of significant amounts of Fe(III) and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) in the powder. However, Na2FePO4F/CNTs composites exhibit good electrochemical performance when cycling against lithium, with a discharge capacity of 104mAhg−1 at C/10 rate and 90mAhg−1 at 1C rate. Therefore, operando 57Fe transmission Mössbauer spectroscopy analyses were carried out in order to investigate the evolution of the iron oxidation state during cycling. During the first discharge, all the Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II), explaining the good electrochemical performance.

Abstract: Novel interfacial microwave heating of a layered structure has been applied to the process of low-temperature annealing of titania mesoporous films for dye-sensitized solar cells. Interfacial microwave annealing dramatically enhances the cell performances as compared with conventional heating in an electric oven. The improvement of cell performance is attributed to the electron transport properties in the titania films annealed by MW resulting in longer diffusion length as compared with conventional heating.

Abstract: Tungsten doped indium oxide (IWO) film was deposited by reactive plasma deposition technology for a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell. The average transmittance and absorption of IWO film from 350 to 1200nm wavelength was 88.33% and 2.16% respectively. The hall mobility is 77.8cm2/Vs, with a corresponding carrier concentration of 2.86E20cm−3 and resistivity of 2.80E−04Ωcm. Based on high-performance IWO film, the 5in. SHJ solar cell with efficiency value of 22.03% and power of 3.37W was obtained by electroplated copper metallization technology. Compared with screen printed SHJ solar cells, the fingers of electroplated cells show finer width, higher aspect ratio and lower series resistance, resulting in increased fill factor and higher efficiency. The long term stability test of copper electroplated cells reveal that IWO film has excellent stability at the solar cell modules׳ operating temperature and can prevent copper diffusion effectively, which makes copper metallization of high efficiency heterojunction solar cell possible.

Abstract: Thin film Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells with ALD-deposited Zn1–xSnxOy buffer layers are fabricated and the solar cell properties are investigated for varying ALD deposition temperatures in the range from 90°C up to 180°C. It is found that a process window exists between 105°C and 135°C, where high solar cell efficiency can be achieved. At lower ALD deposition temperatures the solar cell performance is mainly limited by low fill factor and at higher temperatures by low open circuit voltage. Numerical simulations and electrical characterization are used to relate the changes in solar cell performance as a function of ALD deposition temperature to changes in the conduction band energy level of the Zn1–xSnxOy buffer layer. The Zn1–xSnxOy films contain small ZnO or ZnO(Sn) crystallites (<10nm), which may lead to quantum confinement effects influencing the optical band gap of the buffer layer. The ALD deposition temperature affects the size of these crystallites and it is concluded that most of the changes in the ZTO band gap occur in the conduction band level.

Abstract: Solar energy can be directly harnessed for power generation by using solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) technology, which comprises of solar absorbers integrated with thermoelectric materials. STEGs behave as solid state heat engines, which can utilize the heat energy of the sun to produce a temperature gradient across a thermoelectric device, which is in turn converted to electrical energy. In this paper, we focus on investigating the performance of the solar absorber subsystem that employs a high temperature spectrally selective coating on a stainless steel substrate. We have performed temperature measurements on the absorber coating exposed to solar irradiation flux at different optical concentration ratios (10–100) and validated the experimental data using a numerical heat transfer model in COMSOL Multiphysics. This has been combined with the high temperature emittance measurements of the coating to develop a predictive efficiency model for the STEG system as a function of the thermoelectric figure of merit at a hot side temperature range of 100–500°C. Further, we have experimentally examined the performance of a natural convective cooled STEG consisting of a series combination of three commercial Bi2Te3 thermoelectric modules coupled to the selective absorber coating. The maximum power generated from the STEG has been measured at different concentration ratios and the peak efficiency of the system has been calculated in the feasible temperature range of the thermoelectric module.

Abstract: EPAS-1/HIF-2α (Endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1/hypoxia-inducible transcription factors 2α) is a transcription factor expressed in a wide range of human cancers, including stomach cancer. Although EPAS-1 has been studied for years, its function in oncogenic transformation processes needs to be further investigated. In this study, we found that EPAS-1 would promote the growth of stomach cancer cell line BGC-823. Our results revealed that EPAS-1 interacts with Pregnane X Receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that regulates multiple genes’ transcription involved in multi-drugs resistance (MDR) process. Protein-protein interaction between EPAS-1 and PXR was identified by co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pull down assays. By this interaction, EPAS-1 recruited PXR to its response elements in promoter/enhancer regions of CYP3A4, a PXR target gene. Over-expression of EPAS-1 increased the expression of PXR responsive genes, enhanced the proliferation of BGC-823 cells and boosted the resistance of BGC-823 cells against the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs, e.g. Mitomycin C and Paclitaxel. Reduction of EPAS-1 level via its siRNA disrupted the proliferation, and enhanced the susceptibility of BGC-823 cells to those chemotherapeutic drugs. Our findings suggested that EPAS-1 and PXR may cooperatively participate in development and especially MDR process of stomach cancer. These findings may contribute to more effective targeted drugs discovery for the stomach cancer therapy.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel photoanode system of self-assembled hybrid Polyvinylcarbazole (PVK)–titania nanocomposites (PVTs) using template guided polymerization in a mixed phase of rutile–anatase titania nanotubes. Mixed crystalline phase of titania was prepared by aminolysis process through a controllable capping mechanism. During vinyl carbazole (VK) addition, the charges present on the surface of titania adsorb VK molecules and act as a template during propagation and allow the growing PVK molecular chains adhere along the walls of the titania nanotubes via the combination of various non-covalent interactions. UV–vis spectral band of PVT exhibited broad band with red shift revealing its synergistic effect of harvesting photons. Morphological and XRD studies revealed the preservation of tubular shape and mixed phase of rutile–anatase in PVT nanotubes. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated with PVTs as photoanode using N719 dye as the photo-sensitizer. Conduction mechanism of the excited charge carriers in the device was studied by electrochemical impedance analysis. The presence of mixed anatase–rutile titania phase enhanced the electron transfer thereby reducing the charge recombination which is manifested from the studies made using individual phase of titania. PVT based cell characteristics were optimized to be Voc=0.83V, Jsc=12.01mA/cm2, FF=30.22 with an overall power conversion efficiency of η=3.03% which suggests that the present strategy can be exploited for the development of efficient photoanode systems.

Abstract: Solar selective coatings based on carbon transition metal carbide nanocomposite absorber layers were designed. Pulsed filtered cathodic arc was used for depositing amorphous carbon:metal carbide (a-C:MeC, Me = V, Mo) thin films. Composition and structure of the samples were characterized by ion beam analysis, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The optical properties were determined by ellipsometry and spectrophotometry. Three effective medium approximations (EMA), namely Maxwell-Garnett, Bruggeman, and Bergman, were applied to simulate the optical behaviour of the nanocomposite thin films. Excellent agreement was achieved between simulated and measured reflectance spectra in the entire wavelength range by using the Bergman approach, where in-depth knowledge of the nanocomposite thin film microstructure is included. The reflectance is shown to be a function of the metal carbide volume fraction and its degree of percolation, but not dependent on whether the nanocomposite microstructure is homogeneous or a self-organized multilayer. Solar selective coatings based on an optimized a-C:MeC absorber layer were designed exhibiting a maximum solar absorptance of 96% and a low thermal emittance of ~5% and 15% at 25 and 600°C, respectively. The results of this study can be considered as a predictive design tool for nanomaterial-based optical coatings in general.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the presence of voids in local aluminum rear contacts of PERC solar cells reduces the Al-BSF depths when compared to filled contacts. However, since voided contacts still exhibit a shallow Al-BSF we conclude that voids form during the re-crystallization process of the Al-BSF and thus at a point in time during furnace firing, where the aluminum is liquid. We propose an analytical model for void formation which takes into account the surface energies of the silicon wafer, the liquid aluminum as well as the aluminum-oxide shells of the screen-printed aluminum layer. Using geometrical approximations the model predicts that voids occur if the contact height exceeds a certain value. Scanning electron microscope cross-section measurements demonstrate that indeed voids are observed only for contact heights larger than 21µm. The physical reason is, that in case of large contact heights the Al melt energetically favors to wet the large surface area of the aluminum-oxide shells instead of the relatively small area of the silicon wafer surface. We find that so-called PERC+ solar cells with Al fingers as rear contacts instead of full-area Al layers exhibit significantly smaller contact heights and hence exhibit almost no voids. Additionally, PERC+ solar cells exhibit much deeper Al-BSFs compared to PERC cells over a large range of rear contact widths. Using a new analytical model for Al-BSF formation, we find that the different Al-BSF depths are described solely by the different amount of Al paste printed to the rear side of PERC and PERC+ cells. Consequently, the PERC+ cells achieve low contact recombination and high efficiencies of 21.1% for narrow contact lines around 50µm width, whereas PERC solar cells obtain highest efficiencies of 21.2% for 80µm wide contact lines.

Abstract: In this work, a thin layer of bismuth (Bi) is pre-deposited on the Mo-coated glass before the deposition of the Cu2ZnSnS4 to optimize the properties of the Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film and the performance of corresponding solar cell. It is found that the pre-deposition of Bi leads to the improvement in the crystallinity of synthesized Cu2ZnSnS4 film as evidenced by large grain sizes and less grain boundaries. Photoluminescence measurement indicates that the recombination in the film is inhibited as the reduction of the boundaries which is always regarded as the recombination centers of the carriers. Besides, the reaction of Zn into CZTS lattice is promoted with the decrease of the second phase ZnS. In addition, the inserted Bi layer blocks the diffusion of S atoms into Mo with the reduced thickness of MoS2 at CZTS|Mo interface. It decreases the cell series resistance. Because of the improvements above, the performance of the cell with pre-deposited Bi is boosted.

Abstract: We have studied the effect of different cleanings at device level for nPERT (passivated Emitter, Rear Totally diffused) cells with a rear epitaxial emitter. Cleanings based on sulfuric acid and peroxide mixtures (SPM), which are effective but also expensive, were used as reference. We found that simplified cleanings such as those based on sulfuric acid and ozone mixtures (SOM), and those based on water and ozone (IPV), are giving similar results at device level as the expensive SPM cleaning, leading to similar J0e, J0, FSF, and lifetime values. The implied VOC values of corresponding test devices fabricated using the simplified cleanings are at the same high level as the test devices using more expensive SPM cleanings. Actual nPERT devices with moderately doped epitaxially-grown emitters with a constant doping profile (box profile) showed average efficiencies above 22.0% for both SOM and IPV cleanings. Very high VOC values of up to 695mV and implied VOC values of up to 730mV were shown for cells with a flat rear surface. Finally, the best nPERT cells with rear epitaxial emitter and SOM cleaning showed efficiencies up to 22.5%, as externally confirmed by ISE CalLab.

Abstract: Ti/Al2O3 coating was designed and developed for the growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-based tandem absorber on stainless steel (SS) substrates. The aluminum and titanium target power densities and oxygen flow rates were optimized to deposit the Ti/Al2O3 coatings. The optimized Ti/Al2O3 coating with a Co catalyst on top was used as an underlying substrate to grow the CNT-based tandem absorber at 800°C in Ar+H2 atmosphere (i.e., SS/Ti/Al2O3/Co/CNT). The formation of aluminum titanium oxide (AlTiO) was observed during the CNT growth process and this layer enhances the optical properties of the CNT based tandem absorber. At 0.36µm CNT coating thickness, the tandem absorber exhibits an absorptance of 0.95 and an emittance of 0.20. The optical constants of Ti, Al2O3 and AlTiO coatings were measured using phase modulated spectroscopic ellipsometry in the wavelength range of 300–900nm. The experimentally measured ellipsometric parameters have been fitted with the simulated spectra using Tauc-Lorentz model for generating the dispersion of the optical constants of the Al2O3 and the AlTiO layers. The Ti and Al2O3 layer thicknesses play a major role in designing CNT based tandem absorber with good optical properties. The transmission electron microscopy studies showed that the as-grown CNTs were multi-walled in nature. The angular and the polarization dependence studies of the CNT based tandem absorber grown at different thicknesses were carried out using UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer.

Abstract: Different synthesis protocols have been developed to control TiO2 anatase nanoparticle packing. The diameter of TiO2 packing aggregate varies from 13nm to a few 100nm. Efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) fabricated with the obtained TiO2 packing aggregate films was reported to depend on the size of the packing aggregate. It increases with the increase of the aggregate size (number of TiO2 nanoparticles) to a maximum of 4.3% and then it decreases. This effect was discussed in terms of a balance between the incident light scatterings, adsorbing amount of dye molecules, cracks free and the efficiency of electron transfer (reduction of recombination process).

Abstract: Diacylglycerol (DAG), a second messenger involved in different cell signaling cascades, activates protein kinase C (PKC) and D (PKD), among other kinases. The present work analyzes the effects resulting from the alteration of DAG levels on neuronal and muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) distribution. We employ CHO-K1/A5 cells, expressing adult muscle-type AChR in a stable manner, and hippocampal neurons, which endogenously express various subtypes of neuronal AChR. CHO-K1/A5 cells treated with dioctanoylglycerol (DOG) for different periods showed augmented AChR cell surface levels at short incubation times (30min–4h) whereas at longer times (18h) the AChR was shifted to intracellular compartments. Similarly, in cultured hippocampal neurons surface AChR levels increased as a result of DOG incubation for 4h. Inhibition of endogenous DAG catabolism produced changes in AChR distribution similar to those induced by DOG treatment. Specific enzyme inhibitors and Western blot assays revealed that DAGs exert their effect on AChR distribution through the modulation of the activity of classical PKC (cPKC), novel PKC (nPKC) and PKD activity.

Abstract: A high thermochromic performance is required for the thermochromic film application in space radiator. The performance can be improved by material selection or structure design. Here, we constructed a two-dimensional structure composed of silicon microcavity array coated with thermochromic film. From detailed numerical simulation, we found that periodic microcavity array plays a key role in enhancing the spectral emittance. For 1.5μm deep microcavity with a 500nm thick thermochromic film, an emittance peak appears at the wavelength of 12.7μm, which corresponds to the Fabry–Perot (FP) resonance mode. Another microcavity excitation was observed in the shorter wavelength region, which matches well with its resonance wavelength. Based on the simulations, the optimal structure was fabricated by etching and sputtering methods. The fabricated structure shows a high tunable emittance behavior with emittance increment reaching 0.41. Both the experiment and simulation identified that the microcavity beneath thermochromic film can improve its thermochromic performance.

Abstract: This work demonstrates low-ohmic electrical contacting of phosphorus- and boron-doped surfaces (textured and passivated) with maximum dopant concentrations of only Nmax≈2·1019cm−3 by screen-printed and fired metallization. The achieved results using commercially available metallization pastes allow for a substantial extension of the limits in which screen-printed and fired metallization can be applied for solar cell fabrication. Despite the very low Nmax, the investigations reveal reasonably low specific contact resistances of ρC=(8±3)mΩcm2 for a silver paste on alkaline textured, phosphorus-doped, and SiNx passivated surfaces, and ρC=(3.7±0.7)mΩcm2 for a silver aluminum paste on alkaline textured, boron-doped, and Al2O3/SiNx passivated surfaces.

Abstract: The capability to control in an smart way the infrared reflectance to environmental temperature variations can be achieved with thermochromic materials like VO2. In this paper, we report the application of VO2 on ceramic tiles aiming to control the reflected infrared radiation on smart roofs and thus improving the energy efficiency, which is associated to the reduction of the carbon dioxide emissions. The VO2 nanoparticles have been produced by hydrothermal synthesis assisted by microwave irradiation, providing a new, quicker and cleaner production route. Afterwards, the VO2 nanoparticles were transferred to the surface of ceramic glassy tiles, which were prepared through dispersing the nanopowders in water and followed by spray coating with posterior annealing treatments in order to promote the surface adhesion as well as the stabilization of the material monoclinic phase. The VO2 transition temperature was controlled by doping with tungsten and a reduction from 69°C to 49°C was achieved. The superior thermochromic characteristics of VO2 nanoparticles in conjunction with this new application to a smart roof offers a great potential to regulate the energy in an intelligent way.

Abstract: Optical filters can be used to increase solar conversion efficiency in hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors by partitioning incident light into two spectra: one desirable for direct electrical conversion and one for thermal collection. This article is the first to present both modeled and experimental results for a spectrally-tailorable, multi-particle nanofluid filter positioned between a concentrated light source and a silicon cell. The nanofluid is composed of suspended core–shell silver-silica (Ag–SiO2) nanodiscs and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in water. The core–shell particles were specifically synthesized and designed to absorb the majority of the visible spectrum, while transmitting the light which corresponds to the PV cell. The silver nanodiscs strongly absorb visible light with minimal scattering, whereas the silica shell maintains the shape and absorption spectrum of the silver cores. Alternatively, low-concentration carbon nanotube (CNT) solutions were used to enhance absorption (particularly of ultra-violet light) and to provide a comparison for selective filters versus broadband absorbers. Varying dilutions of the Ag–SiO2 nanofluid are compared to solutions diluted with dispersed CNTs. The CNTs enhance the heating rate of the nanofluid with the caveat of non-selective light absorption, which reduces the electrical output. Ag–SiO2 nanofluids (0.026wt%) increased combined efficiencies by 30% compared to the base fluid filter alone. For a small additional cost of <$1/L of nanofluid, the developed system represents a highly efficient hybrid generator which can be dynamically tailored to meet variable thermal energy and electricity prices.

Abstract: Kerf losses due to ingot and wafer sawing can be avoided by solidifying the silicon wafers directly from the melt by the Ribbon Growth on Substrate (RGS) process, thus significantly reducing the wafer cost. However, up to now solar cells made from standard RGS material suffered from shunting problems due to current collecting structures. This resulted in lower fill factor values and hence in lower efficiencies compared to solar cells made from block-cast multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) materials. In this contribution two novel RGS materials are presented and investigated. Solar cells processed from these new materials have fill factor values above 78%, comparable to those of mc-Si. The increased fill factor values can be explained by the absence of current collecting structures as concluded from a comparative analysis of spatially resolved Light Beam Induced Current (LBIC) measurements and Electroluminescence (EL) images, and from infrared transmission microscopy investigations. Additionally the improved material quality resulted in open-circuit voltage VOC values up to 608mV. This enhanced material quality, in combination with increased fill factor values, resulted in record efficiencies above 16% (certified by Fraunhofer ISE CalLab). This represents a significant improvement compared to the former efficiency record of 14.4% for standard RGS material.

Abstract: In this study, the graphene sheets produced by supercritical CO2 exfoliation of graphite were used to improve the photovoltaic performance of the CdS quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). The zinc titanium mixed metal oxides (MMO) based on layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor and the graphene/MMO hybrid materials were used as photoanodes of the CdS QDSSCs, respectively. The presence of graphene in the photoanodes was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The influence of graphene concentration on the performance of CdS QDSSCs was studied by electrochemical method. The addition of graphene enhanced QDs adsorption properties and lowered internal resistance, so the QDSSCs displayed higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). Accordingly, the highest PCE of the QDSSCs based on graphene/Zn-Ti MMO photoanode reached 0.44% and increased 37.5% in compared with that based on plain Zn-Ti MMO working electrodes.

Abstract: Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells on stainless steel (SUS) substrates are fabricated with various [Ga]/([Ga]+[In]), GGI, profiles in their absorbers. From GGI profiles, near-surface GGI is defined as average GGI within 200nm from CIGS surface, mini GGI value is the lowest GGI, and mini GGI position is a distance between the lowest GGI position and CIGS surface. These are used as representatives of the GGI profile. Their impacts on cell performances are quantitatively examined. It is revealed that near-surface GGI is optimized in a range of approximately 0.40–0.45 (or band-gap energy of 1.28–1.30eV), resulting in improvement of conduction band offset at CdS/CIGS interface. From simulation, optimized mini GGI position is in a range of 250–350nm, well consistent with space charge region width. According to experimental results, fill factor and open-circuit voltage are increased when mini GGI position is decreased from 1.1 to 0.4µm, while short-circuit current density is increased with decreasing mini GGI value. Ultimately, 17.3%-efficient CIGS solar cell on flexible SUS substrate with thin CIGS thickness of 1.5µm is achieved, where near-surface GGI, mini GGI position, and mini GGI value are 0.42, 0.5µm, and 0.06, respectively.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, hyperglycaemia induces damage to renal tubular epithelial cells, which may lead to EMT in diabetic nephropathy. However, the effects of miRNAs on EMT in diabetic nephropathy are poorly understood. In the present study, we found that the level of microRNA-23b (miR-23b) was significantly decreased in high glucose (HG)-induced human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) and in kidney tissues of db/db mice. Overexpression of miR-23b attenuated HG-induced EMT, whereas knockdown of miR-23b induced normal glucose (NG)-mediated EMT in HK2 cells. Mechanistically, miR-23b suppressed EMT in diabetic nephropathy by targeting high mobility group A2 (HMGA2), thereby repressing PI3K-AKT signalling pathway activation. Additionally, HMGA2 knockdown or inhibition of the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway with LY294002 mimicked the effects of miR-23b overexpression on HG-mediated EMT, whereas HMGA2 overexpression or activation of the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway with BpV prevented the effects of miR-23b on HG-mediated EMT. We also confirmed that overexpression of miR-23b alleviated EMT, decreased the expression levels of EMT-related genes, ameliorated renal morphology, glycogen accumulation, fibrotic responses and improved renal functions in db/db mice. Taken together, we showed for the first time that miR-23b acts as a suppressor of EMT in diabetic nephropathy through repressing PI3K-AKT signalling pathway activation by targeting HMGA2, which maybe a potential therapeutic target for diabetes-induced renal dysfunction.

Abstract: The progresses made in emerging perovskite solar cells, a promising alternative photovoltaic technology to the conventional solar cells, have quickly set the power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of 20%. Apart from the high PCE, the stability of perovskite solar cells is another important issue for them to be commercially viable. To investigate the impact of electrodes on the stability of the perovskite solar cells, cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Cathode, having different cathode contacts of Al, Ag and AgAl alloy, were fabricated. The cells with an AgAl alloy cathode reached a PCE of 11.76%, which is slightly higher than that (11.45%) of the structurally identical cells with Ag contact, much higher than that for the ones with Al electrode (7.95%). The stable open-circuit voltage (VOC) of cells having an AgAl contact was demonstrated, with almost no change in the VOC after 360h aging under a relative humidity of 10% in air. However, there is an obvious drop in the VOC of the structurally identical perovskite cells with Ag cathode, e.g., an 85% decrease from its initial VOC value for cells aged under the same condition. The enhancement in the PCE of cells with AgAl cathode is attributed to the formation of AlOX, which can improve built-in potential in the cell and allow an effective electron extraction at the PCBM/AgAl cathode interface. An interfacial AlOX interlayer could be formed at the interface between PCBM and AgAl contact during thermal evaporation and aging. The presence of the interfacial AlOX interlayer helps to prevent the diffusion of the Ag atoms into the active layer, to improve the adhesion of the metal contact on PCBM and also to avoid moisture encroachment.

Abstract: It has been reported that metabolites regulate circadian rhythms through direct effects on clock genes. A metabolic network involving PER3 raises the possibility that some metabolic regulators are directly involved in the mammalian clock. Here, we show that the bHLH family transcription factor TFEB regulates PER3 through the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex. In the liver, TFEB expression displays circadian rhythms. A loss of TFEB function disrupts and dampens the expression of PER3 but not the expression of other circadian genes, such as PER1, PER2, CRY1 and CRY2. TFEB physically interacts with CLOCK/BMAL1 through its N-terminal region. In the presence of TFEB, BMAL1/CLOCK-mediated transcription is enhanced. Moreover, the TFEB/CLOCK/BMAL1 complex is regulated by glucose. These results show that TFEB has a role in the mammalian clock mechanism.

Abstract: We report for the first time, titanium dioxide–graphene (HRTiO2–Gr) composite with exposed (001) facets by a photochemical reduction method and its selective photocatalytic properties. The drastic reduction in the photoluminescence intensity of the composite indicates effective charge separation. The composite with 10wt% Gr (HRTiO2–Gr10) exhibits higher photodegradation (PD) of methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) compared to that of the P25. The composite exhibits selectivity in its PD properties, with higher photocatalytic activity for the positive dyes, MB and RhB. This is attributed to the synergistic effect of the unique pore morphology and the surface properties of the composite due to the negative Gr. Higher selectivity in the PD of the positive dyes is observed in the mixture of the positive and negative dyes. In addition, HRTiO2–Gr10 exhibits lower charge transfer resistance than that of the HRTiO2 and P25. The improved charge transfer resistance is assigned to the thin Gr sheets which improves the charge transfer at the interfaces. Our results suggest that the PCR method of preparation facilitates higher loading of high quality thin Gr sheets with improved dispersion and interaction with TiO2 thus imparting the composite selective and enhanced photocatalytic properties.

Abstract: We compare the recombination properties of three important types of multicrystalline silicon wafers for solar cells, namely conventionally-solidified p-type and n-type multicrystalline wafers, and also the recently developed ‘high performance’ p-type multicrystalline wafers. Three distinct regions of the wafers are examined in detail. These are the intra-grain regions, the grain boundaries, and the dislocation networks. The response of these regions to phosphorous gettering and hydrogenation are also characterised and compared. The electrical properties of intra-grain regions are assessed based on both the minority carrier lifetime and diffusion length. The recombination activities of grain boundaries are compared quantitatively in terms of their effective surface recombination velocities. The recombination behaviour of dislocations is evaluated qualitatively based on photoluminescence images. Our results show that the main performance limiting factors are likely to be recombination at crystal defects. Overall, grain boundaries in conventional p-type samples are more recombination active than those in high performance p-type and conventional n-type samples. The benefits of hydrogenation are most visible on n-type samples, leading to significant deactivation of most of the grain boundaries. As-grown grain boundaries and dislocations in high performance multicrystalline silicon tend not to be recombination active, and only become active after either gettering or hydrogenation.

Abstract: Effective tunnel recombination junctions (TRJs) are crucial to achieve high conversion efficiencies in hydrogenated amorphous/ microcrystalline silicon (a-Si:H/μc-Si:H) micromorph solar cells. In conventional TRJs, the n-μc-Si:H layer is used to form an ohmic contact between the n- and p-type layers, which introduces additional absorption loss in the TRJs. Here we demonstrated an effective TRJ without using the n-μc-Si:H layer in a-Si:H/μc-Si:H micromorph solar cells, which we denote as an evolutionary TRJ. In comparison to the conventional n-μc-SiOx:H/n-μc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOx:H TRJs, the evolutionary structure reduces the parasitic absorption and thus significantly increases the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the bottom cell. A high initial efficiency of 13.65% has been achieved for the a-Si:H/μc-Si:H micromorph solar cells deposited on the as-grown metal organic chemical vapor deposited ZnO:B substrates.

Abstract: The insertion of quantum dots in a host material produces band offsets which are greatly dependent on the field of strains brought about by this insertion. Based on the Empiric KP Hamiltonian model, the energy spectrum of the quantum dot/host system is easily calculated and a relationship between the conduction and valence band offsets is determined by the energy at which the lowest peak of the sub-bandgap quantum efficiency of an intermediate band solar cell is situated; therefore knowledge of the valence band offset leads to knowledge of both offsets. The calculated sub-bandgap quantum efficiency due to the quantum dot is rather insensitive to the value of the valence band offset. However, the calculated quantum efficiency of the wetting layer, modeled as a quantum well, is sensitive to the valence band offset and a fitting with the measured value is possible resulting in a determination of both offsets in the finished solar cell with its final field of strains. The method is applied to an intermediate-band solar cell prototype made with InAs quantum dots in GaAs.

Abstract: Phorbol diester PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) is a well-known promoter of tumor progression. PMA also regulates cell adhesion by several mechanisms including conformational activation of integrins and integrin clustering. Here, PMA was shown to induce lamellipodia formation and reorganization of the adhesion sites as well as actin and vimentin filaments independently of integrin preactivation. To further analyze the mechanism of PMA action, the protein composition in the α1β1 integrin/collagen IV adhesion sites was analyzed by mass spectrometry and proteomics. In four independent experiments we observed the reduced recruitment of vimentin in relation to integrin α1 subunit. This was in full agreement with the fact that we also detected the retraction of vimentin from cell adhesions by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, the accumulation of kindlin-2 into cell adhesions was significantly increased after PMA treatment. Kindlin-2 siRNA inhibited cell spreading as well as the formation of actin fibrils and cell adhesions, but did not prevent the effect of PMA on lamellipodia formation. Thus, kindlin-2 recruitment was considered to be a consequence rather than the primary cause for the loss of connection between vimentin and the adhesion sites.

Abstract: This paper describes the impacts of different cool black paints on cooling and heating load demand of a residential building in different climates. Cool paints with dark appearance and high reflectance in near infrared portion of sunlight are of great interest by the owners of homes to satisfy both desired visual and energy saving aspects. Three copper oxide (CuO) powders, different in pigment size, and a chromium–iron oxide (Cr2O3–Fe2O3) powder, as a commercial cool black pigment, are used to make the black paints. The samples are made on both conventional black and cool white base coats. The spectral reflectance of all samples in solar range (0.3–2.5µm) and infrared region (2.5–25µm) is measured. The thermal emittance of the samples is estimated using the spectral reflectance measurement and validated by the measurement of infrared camera. A typical residential single-stage single-family home in three different climates of Iran is considered and the impacts of applying the different black paints on cooling and heating load demand are discussed. The results show that the peak and annual cooling load demand decrease by 0.4–1.4kW (6–13%) and 405–2202kWh (6–14%), respectively, depends on the type of pigmented coating and climate conditions.

Abstract: Using density-functional theory in combination with the nonequilibrium Green׳s function formalism, we study the effect of iodide/chloride and iodide/bromide mixing on the electronic transport in lead based organometallic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, which is known to be an effective tool to tune the electronic and optical properties of such materials. We found that depending on the level and position of the halide-mixing, the electronic transport can be increased by more than a factor of 4 for a given voltage biasing. The largest current is observed for small concentration of bromide substitutions located at the equatorial sites. However, full halide substitution has a negative effect on the transport properties of this material: the current drops by an order of magnitude for both CH3NH3PbCl3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 samples.

Abstract: As a promising indium-free electrode, transparent composite electrode (TCE) TiO2/Ag/TiO2 is an attractive alternative to indium tin oxide (ITO). The multilayer structure of TiO2/Ag/TiO2 is deposited on glass substrate by room-temperature sputtering. The effects of deposition rate, thickness of Ag and TiO2 layers on the electrical and optical properties of this TCE are presented. Results show that the Ag films tend to have fewer voids to form, if the Ag deposition rate is sufficiently high. The presence of fewer voids in the Ag layer results in higher transmittance and lower sheet resistance of the corresponding TiO2/Ag/TiO2 structure. In order to increase the solar input to the P3HT:PC61BM organic solar cell, the layer thicknesses of TiO2/Ag/TiO2 electrodes are theoretically and then experimentally optimized, such that its optical transmittances are maximized across the wavelength range where the light absorption of P3HT:PC61BM is highest. In this study, the device-specific Haacke figure of merit (FOM) of the TiO2/Ag/TiO2 electrode is optimal with the use of 42nm TiO2 layers and 10nm Ag layer. This optimal Haacke FOM is two times higher than that of ITO electrodes. The conventional bulk heterojunction organic solar cell (OSC) fabricated on optimized TiO2/Ag/TiO2 electrode shows high power conversion efficiency (PCE), almost 100% higher than PCE of OSC fabricated on ITO. Our finding indicates that TiO2/Ag/TiO2 electrode can be specifically tailored to particular applications. It can be implemented in organic solar cell and has considerable potential to replace ITO in solar cell applications.

Abstract: This paper deals with homoepitaxial growth of Cu2O thin films using the electrochemical deposition (ECD) method. It also discusses the photovoltaic properties of solar cells that use the active layer of p-type Cu2O thin film prepared by epitaxial growth. Such a film was formed at 70°C on a degenerated p-type Cu2O:Na (p+-type Cu2O: Na) substrate, and this film produced on a substrate with a (110) plane orientation was oriented only in the (110) plane. The crystallite size of the produced Cu2O thin film (58.8nm) was larger than that of the film produced on FTO (SnO2: F) (14.6nm). A photoelectric conversion efficiency of 2.36% was achieved for the AZO/p-type Cu2O thin film/p+-type Cu2O:Na heterojunction solar cell in which a degenerated Al-doped ZnO (AZO) thin film was prepared as the transparent electrode layer on the Cu2O thin film by pulse laser deposition. Furthermore, photoelectric conversion efficiency of 4.41% was achieved for the AZO/n-type Ga0.975Al0.025O/p-type Cu2O/p+-type Cu2O:Na heterojunction solar cell with n-type Ga0.975Al0.025O film inserted between the AZO and p-type Cu2O thin film. This clearly shows that the Cu2O thin film produced by epitaxial growth on a p+-type Cu2O:Na (p+-type Cu2O: Na) substrate is superior as an active layer.

Abstract: A low electric resistive and stable back contact on p-type CdTe semiconductor is crucial for the commercial employment of high efficiency CdTe thin film solar cell. In this study, V2O5 was deposited as a buffer layer between CdTe and metal electrode in the back contact of CdTe solar cells. Different back contact structures were fabricated on CdTe to study the effect of a V2O5 buffer layer on cell device performance. Both the quantitative band alignment and the device performance of the CdTe solar cells with a V2O5 buffer layer demonstrated that a much lower Schottky barrier was formed compared to the cells with an Au-only back contact. The defect states related to oxygen vacancy within the band gap of the V2O5 played a crucial role in reducing the energy barrier for hole carrier transport. Employing a back contact structure of Cu/V2O5/Cu/Au, a CdTe solar cell with an efficiency as high as 14.0% was fabricated. Long term device stressing test demonstrated that, compared to the CdTe cells with a Cu/Au back electrode, solar cells with the insertion of a V2O5 buffer layer showed much enhanced device stability.

Abstract: Flexible electrochromic devices (ECDs) based on Fe(II)-metallo-supramolecular polyelectrolytes (Fe-MEPE) and vanadium oxide are studied in operando by means of x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. The ECDs are blue–purple in the colored state at 0.0V and become light yellow when a voltage of 1.6V is applied. The XAFS studies at the K-edge of Fe(II) reveals that the absorption edge is shifted toward higher energies by 1.8eV in the transparent state. Comparison of two different ECDs and different charge cycles demonstrates the reversibility and repeatability of the process. We attribute the shift to a charge transfer and a change of oxidation state of the ions from Fe2+ to Fe3+. The transition is not accompanied by a noticeable structural change of the octahedral coordination geometry as confirmed by analysis of the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data.

Abstract: In this paper commercially relevant backsheets are characterized as to their material and laminate structure and basic optical and mechanical properties. Various multilayer backsheet materials were selected and analysed by optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ultra violet visible near infrared spectroscopy (UV/VIS/NIR) and monotonic tensile testing. By Raman and infrared spectroscopy and DSC the polymeric materials of the various layers were identified. Furthermore it was shown for the thermoplastic ethylene vinylacetate copolymer (EVA) layers that three different vinylacetate (VA) contents were used. By TGA a content of inorganic fillers and pigments from about 6%m to approximately 20%m was detected. The hemispherical solar reflectance of the white pigmented backsheets was ranging from 0.695 to 0.838. The highest Young׳s modulus was found in polyvinylfluoride based multilayers while the lowest values were detected for polyamide based structures.

Abstract: An advanced photon management approach is developed for a photovoltaic–thermoelectric hybrid system to increase the solar energy utilization efficiency. A biomimetic parabolic-shaped structure on the Si film and a thin SiO2 film at the bottom of the Si film as back-antireflection coating improves the absorptance of photons with wavelengths of 0.3–1.1μm, which can generate electron–hole pairs. Photons with wavelengths of 1.1–2.5μm transmit through the structured surface and are absorbed by the thermoelectric modules, which improves the conversion efficiency of the entire hybrid system. The structured surface with graded refractive index can effectively harvest photons with wavelengths of 0.3–2.5μm. The effects of the structural parameters and the incident angle on the spectral features of the structured surface are analyzed. The results indicate that the structured surface provides high omnidirectional absorptance for wavelengths of 0.3–1.1μm and high transmittance for wavelengths of 1.1–2.5μm as well as favorable polarization-insensitive features over a good incident angle range as a good candidate for the photovoltaic–thermoelectric hybrid systems.

Abstract: Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2 is a pivotal transcriptional factor in cholesterol metabolism. Factors interfering with the proper functioning of SREBP-2 potentially alter plasma lipid profiles. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which is a common protein kinase C (PKC) activator, was shown to promote the post-translational processing and nuclear translocation of SREBP-2 in hepatic cells in the current study. Following SREBP-2 translocation, the transcripts of its target genes HMGCR and LDLR were upregulated as demonstrated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) also demonstrated an induced DNA-binding activity on the sterol response element (SRE) domain under PMA treatment. The increase of activated Srebp-2 without the concurrent induced mRNA expression was also observed in an animal model. As the expression of SREBP-2 was not increased by PMA, the activation of PKC was the focus of investigation. Specific PKC isozyme inhibition and overexpression supported that PKCβ was responsible for the promoting effect. Further studies showed that the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), but not 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), were the possible downstream signaling proteins of PKCβ. In conclusion, this study illustrated that PKCβ increased SREBP-2 nuclear translocation in a pathway mediated by MEK/ERK and JNK, rather than the one dictated by AMPK. These results revealed a novel signaling target of PKCβ in the liver cells.

Abstract: Influenza A virus (IAV) infection triggers autophagosome formation, but inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. However, the role of autophagy in IAV replication is still largely unclarified. In this study, we aim to reveal the role of autophagy in IAV replication and the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation. By using autophagy-deficient (Atg7−/−) MEFs, we demonstrated that autophagy deficiency significantly reduced the levels of viral proteins, mRNA and genomic RNAs (vRNAs) without affecting viral entry. We further found that autophagy deficiency lead to a transient increase in phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream targets including 4E-BP1 and S6 at a very early stage of IAV infection, and markedly suppressed p70S6K phosphorylation at the late stage of IAV infection. Furthermore, autophagy deficiency resulted in impairment of Hsp90 induction in response to IAV infection. These results indicate that IAV regulates autophagy to benefit the accumulation of viral elements (synthesis of viral proteins and genomic RNA) during IAV replication. This regulation is associated with modulation of Hsp90 induction and mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway. Our results provide important evidence for the role of autophagy in IAV replication and the mechanisms underlying the regulation.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) is a very promising material as absorber layer for low cost and earth abundant thin film solar cells. Currently in this technology we can find indium in different layers, including the transparent window layer In2O3:SnO2 (ITO), and the In2S3/CdS double emitter, both used in high efficiency devices. Therefore, during devices fabrication processes, In could be a potential contaminant and consequently, it is very interesting to investigate its possible impact in the solar cells performance. Besides this, a key factor in the control of material properties lies in the doping. Extrinsic doping has been barely studied for CZTSe and among the possible doping elements, In is one of the most interesting candidates, because it has the possibility to occupy either Sn or Cu/Zn positions. In this work we investigate the indium doping of CZTSe thin films. For this purpose, CZTSe was synthesized by a sequential process with different nominal In concentrations ranging from 0 to 2.6×1020cm−3. We demonstrate that In is uniformly introduced in CZTSe, not affecting the main elements distribution, but impacting in the Na quantity at the surface. Drastic changes on the morphology are observed, where the increasing indium concentration leads to the formation of a bilayer structure. Efficiencies in the range of 7–7.5% or 8.5–9.2% were obtained for In concentrations below 2.6×1019cm−3 for pure CZTSe and CZTSe:Ge respectively, decreasing for further doping levels mainly due to the deterioration of the fill factor, while the other optoelectronic parameters are less affected. We propose a phenomenological model supported by the complete electrical characterization of the material and devices, showing that a conductive phase deteriorates the properties of the system that we associate to the possible presence of mixed Sn-oxides and In-oxides.

Abstract: InAs/GaAs QDs are being investigated in the field of solar cells (SCs) with the aim of achieving high SC performances. In order to control the band offsets and the accumulated strain, the application of capping layers (CLs) made of GaAs-based alloys is becoming a common approach that shows promising advantages for SC applications. However, up to now there are very few statistically reliable studies of their impact on the QD morphologies. Our work by TEM techniques over more than a hundred of InAs QDs has evaluated a broad range of CL materials and structures with Sb and/or N with a singular accuracy. Our outcomes showed that the Sb could play antagonistic roles regarding the QD decomposition depending on the growth conditions. Unlike it occurs at common growth rates (1ML/s), at high growth rates of 2ML/s the Sb does not protect the QDs, but even intensifies their erosion. On the other side, N provides the best results in terms of maintaining the original shape of the QDs. In the case of a simultaneous presence of Sb and N, a synergetic effect in the erosion strength is observed. Nevertheless, avoiding the concomitance presence of N and Sb on the growth front by growing a short-period GaAsSb/GaAsN superlattice CLs moderates this behavior. The results are discussed in terms of processes such as surfactant, intermixing, segregation, bond strength or strain-enhanced diffusion that could operate during the capping process. The strong modifications on the QD–CL morphology, that we show are expected to have a significant impact on QD SC performance, cannot be disregarded.

Abstract: Dye solar cells (DSCs) have emerged as one of the most efficient third-generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies, whose commercialization is mainly hampered by the lack of sufficient long-term stability compared to conventional PV devices. In this work, it is demonstrated that solvent based DSCs using tetraglyme as a non-nitrile, high boiling point, organic solvent for the iodide/triiodide redox shuttle, can pass a harsh accelerated thermal ageing test of 3000h light soaking followed by additional 2000h thermal ageing at 85°C. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis on thermal degradation effects revealed that a conduction band edge shift towards more negative potentials for tetraglyme-DSCs underlies the enhanced photopotential of aged cells, compensating for the thermally induced photocurrent reduction due to slight triiodide loss. The tetraglyme-based solar cells (in contrast to cells based on methoxypropionitrile-MPN) showed exceptional stability, compatible with the established IEC61646 protocol for thin film PVs, keeping ca. 90% of their initial performance under 1sun illumination. Quite notably, the cells even increased their initial efficiency by 4% when illuminated under 0.1sun. This is the first time in literature that such a stability record is accomplished for solvent based DSCs utilizing commercially available and cost-effective materials.

Abstract: A model, adapted from the Shockley–Queisser detailed balance model to tandem solar cells with a monolithically grown GaAsxP1−x top junction on a Si bottom junction, has been developed. Updated data have been used for the absorption spectrums. Two surface geometries, flat and ideally textured, have been investigated. As an important improvement over existing models, the effects of threading-dislocations-related Shockley–Read–Hall recombinations in the GaAsxP1−x cell, due to the lattice mismatch between the GaAsxP1−x epilayers and the Si substrate, have been taken into consideration. Auger recombinations in the Si bottom cell and luminescent coupling between the cells have also been considered. For a dislocation-free 2-μm-thick top cell, maximal theoretical efficiencies of 41.6% and 39.1% have been calculated for a textured and a flat surface, respectively. For threading dislocation (TD) densities below 104cm−2, the impact of TDs in the GaAsxP1−x layers on the solar cell performances is very limited. With TD densities over 105cm−2, the top cell open-circuit voltage is reduced, hence the overall efficiency. For TD densities over 4×106cm−2, as the diffusion length of minority carriers in the base gets smaller than the base thickness, the short-circuit current in the top GaAsxP1−x cell is also reduced, resulting in a decrease in the optimal top cell bandgap. Using non-ideal EQEs and surface recombination rates from published experimental data, the long-term efficiency potential of the investigated technology has been estimated to be ~35.1% for an ideally textured GaAsxP1−x/Si tandem cell with a TD density of 105cm−2 (~33.0% with a flat surface).

Abstract: Colloidal graphene/PbS quantum dots (QDs) hybrid nanostructures are fabricated with chemical grafting in one-pot solution methods. In the hybrid nanocomposites, PbS QDs are decorated on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets (NSs). By employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, it is shown that the rGO NSs are bonded to PbS nanocrystals through oxygen functional groups, leading to improved surface passivation and electrical conductivity in the hybrids. The results obtained by the recordings of time-resolved photoluminescence spectra, field effect mobility, and photovoltaic performance revealed that rGO grafted to PbS QD composite structures provided better charge transport by 16 times compared to PbS alone, which is attributed to suppressed charge recombination and improved interfacial charge transport processes. Thus, the developed hybrid photoactive film enhanced open circuit current (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) by 12% and 14% correspondingly.

Abstract: The hot carrier solar cell is a promising concept for high efficiency photovoltaics. Obtaining the dynamic temperature information for the hot carriers in an absorber is of crucial importance to this concept. In this paper, we present a dynamical hot carrier theory that extracts the carrier temperature and the instantaneous carrier occupation from transient absorption spectra. We have applied this model to two transition metal nitride materials, HfN and ZrN. The analysis showed that for HfN the initial carrier temperature rose to 360K immediately after a femtosecond pulse excitation and then dropped rapidly to 330K within 0.13ps. After this initial process, the carrier temperature still remained relatively elevated at above 320K for as long as 2ns. The initial fast process was attributed to the strong carrier–carrier scattering in the material while the slow decay of temperature might be due to unusually weak electron–phonon interactions. A shorter cooling time and overall lower hot carrier temperatures were observed in ZrN.

Abstract: As new solar cell architectures are developed with superior surface passivation, the boron–oxygen defect becomes an increasingly significant limitation on device performance for p-type Czochralski silicon solar cells. This has led to research into methods of permanently deactivating the recombination activity associated with the defect and how these might be implemented in an industrial environment. While the ability to passivate this defect at temperatures below 500K has been widely reported in the literature, recent results from the authors have demonstrated the ability to achieve near complete passivation of this defect at temperatures in excess of 600K under high intensity illumination. This ability to passivate the defect at higher temperatures than previously reported may be explained by an increase in the rate of defect passivation, or alternately, by an increase in the defect formation rate. This paper explores the dependence of defect passivation upon illumination intensity, temperature and the initial state of the defects. Evidence is presented to suggest that high intensity illumination does not significantly increase the rate of passivation, but rather greatly enhances the defect formation rate. Based upon this understanding it is demonstrated how a 10s process under high intensity illumination may be used to completely eliminate the impact of the boron–oxygen defect on solar cell performance, with no requirement for prior defect formation.

Abstract: As promising candidates for thermophotovoltaic energy conversion systems, epitaxial thin film III–V cells have gained increasing attention due to their potential for reduced weight. However, few studies have been done to date to enhance the performance of epitaxial single crystal GaSb thin film cells. In this work, the internal quantum efficiencies of epitaxial single crystal GaSb thin film cells with Zn-diffused and epitaxial p–n junctions were predicted with models verified using the corresponding experimental results. The results are the first to indicate that, for the former, when the base region thickness is approximately equal to minority carrier diffusion length, the maximal IQE can be obtained and it is notably higher than the IQE of GaSb bulk cell at wavelengths from 800 to 1700nm. Reducing bottom surface recombination velocity and increasing hole Shockley–Read–Hall lifetime could also increase the IQE. While for the latter, the results demonstrated that the optimal base region thickness is also approximately equal to minority diffusion length, and reducing emitter region thickness will increase the IQE when the base region is optimized. The comparison of the two optimized GaSb thin film cells showed that the GaSb thin film cell with epitaxial p–n junction has a higher IQE.

Abstract: Improvements of overall photoconversion efficiencies under simulated 1sun illumination are reported for inorganic perovskite solar cells based on cesium lead halide, CsPbI3, as perovskite absorber material. By modifying the perovskite crystal structure and inserting a particular hole extraction interlayer, a remarkable efficiency enhancement is achieved from 0.09% that was reported previously to 4.68%. Additionally, we demonstrated that the nature of the perovskite crystallinity as well as the charge extraction material play a decisive role in the establishment of the degree of hysteresis. Particularly, fundamental analysis verified that upon the existence of MoO3 layer as a hole extraction interlayer, the I–V hysteresis effect was suppressed. Therefore, this model proposes that the hysteresis is also originated by the interface phenomena and not only by the perovskite film or the structure of the solar cell, mesoporous and planar, effects as have been reported. Our experimental observation suggests that the morphology of the perovskite film in addition to selective interface cathode electrode play a critical role for recording an enhancement of photoconversion efficiencies in perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: In this study, a high performance organic–inorganic polymer photovoltaic device with double-decked anode buffer layer sandwiched between indium tin oxide (ITO) and the photoactive layer is reported. The double-decked buffer layer is fabricated by coating vanadium oxide (V2O5) nanowire on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer and the reported device has the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/V2O5/P3HT:PCBM/Al. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer photovoltaic cells with the hybrid buffer layer is improved by 14.10% compared to the polymer photovoltaic cell commonly employed PEDOT:PSS hole transporting material; and PCE of this proposed polymer photovoltaic cell is improved by 30.40% compared with the polymer photovoltaic cell employed V2O5 powder as buffer layer. The improvement of PCE is mainly caused by the elevation of short circuit current density (Jsc) instead of the open circuit voltage (Voc). Experimental results show that layer of V2O5 nanowires cannot only block electron from wrong directions efficiently, but also increase incident light paths in the hybrid buffer layers due to refraction and reflection. And pseudo texturing effects of V2O5 nanowires which result in higher photon absorptivity of the photoactive layer make polymer photovoltaic cells with this double-decked buffer layer outperform that with buffer layers constructed by either PEDOT:PSS or V2O5 nanowires only.

Abstract: Aluminium induced texturing (AIT) method has been used to texture glass substrates to enhance photon absorption in microcrystalline thin film Si solar cells. In this process, a thin Al film is deposited on a glass substrate and a non-uniform redox reaction between the glass and the Al film occurs when they are annealed at high temperature. After etching the reaction products, the resultant glass surface presents a uniform and rough morphology. In this work, three different textures (σrms~85, ~95, ~125nm) have been achieved by tuning the dc sputtering power and over them and over smooth glass, pin microcrystalline silicon solar cells have been fabricated. The cells deposited over the textured substrates showed an efficiency improvement in comparison to the cells deposited over the smooth glass. The best result was given for the glass texture σrms~125nm that led to an average efficiency 2.1% higher than that given by the cell deposited on smooth glass.

Abstract: Management of the solar spectrum incident on a solar cell was studied using tellurite glasses doped with Tb3+ and Yb3+ ions as a cover slip. From the transmittance measurements through the doped glass, a red-shift of the solar spectrum was observed and the mechanisms involved in this phenomena were investigated through the absorption spectra and luminescent measurements. Energy transfer of the UV radiation into VIS and IR radiation was elucidated by analyzing the emission spectra. From the results, the power dependence of the Yb3+ IR luminescence on the pumping laser intensity at 482nm revealed that the energy transfer mechanism involving a virtual state was predominant in these samples. Total quantum efficiency higher than 100% was obtained for the sample co-doped with 1% of Tb3+ ions and 5% of Yb3+ ions. The efficiency of commercial Silicon and Gallium Phosphide (GaP) solar cells, covered with tellurite glasses doped with Tb3+ and Yb3+ ions, was measured and compared to the efficiency with an un-doped the cover glass. Efficiency enhancement was observed with a dependence on the rare earth ions concentrations, and the results were attributed to the modification of the spectral profile of the incident radiation in the IR region.

Abstract: We present pH-neutral hole transporting layers processed from a solution at room temperature for organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Three new conductive conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs), identified as PFF, PFT and PFSe, containing aromatic five-membered heterocyclic compounds (furan, thiophene, and selenophene, respectively), are designed and synthesized using the Stille-coupling reaction. These polymers dissolve in water/alcohol as they are comprised of a conjugated backbone with hydrophilic side chains of sodium butane sulfonates. The CPEs with heterocyclic rings having stronger dipole moments decrease the work function of ITO electrodes and the surface potential between the active layer and hole-transporting layer (HTL) effectively. The device with PFSe as a HTL exhibits the best performance (7.2%), with JSC of 14.4mAcm−2, VOC of 0.677V and FF of 69.0%. The device also exhibits improvements in air stability under room temperature due to its neutral nature. Also, 70% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) is maintained upon exposure to ambient air for ∼480h, whereas the initial PCE with PEDOT:PSS decreases by more than 50%. Our results indicate that it is possible to improve the performance of OPVs using pH-neutral CPEs as efficient HTLs. We determine the way of molecular design is used to decrease the energy barrier using a heteroatom with a large dipole moment.

Abstract: Cellular senescence is recognized as a potent anticancer mechanism that inhibits carcinogenesis. Cancer cells can also undergo senescence upon chemo- or radiotherapy. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, shows anticancer properties both in vitro and in vivo. Previously, we have shown that treatment with curcumin leads to senescence of human cancer cells. Now we identified the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon. We observed a time-dependent accumulation of mitotic cells upon curcumin treatment. The time-lapse analysis proved that those cells progressed through mitosis for a significantly longer period of time. A fraction of cells managed to divide or undergo mitotic slippage and then enter the next phase of the cell cycle. Cells arrested in mitosis had an improperly formed mitotic spindle and were positive for γH2AX, which shows that they acquired DNA damage during prolonged mitosis. Moreover, the DNA damage response pathway was activated upon curcumin treatment and the components of this pathway remained upregulated while cells were undergoing senescence. Inhibition of the DNA damage response decreased the number of senescent cells. Thus, our studies revealed that the induction of cell senescence upon curcumin treatment resulted from aberrant progression through the cell cycle. Moreover, the DNA damage acquired by cancer cells, due to mitotic disturbances, activates an important molecular mechanism that determines the potential anticancer activity of curcumin.

Abstract: Al2O3–Yb3Al5O12 eutectic rods were directionally solidified using the laser floating zone method at rates between 25 and 750mm/h. The microstructure consisted of an interpenetrated network of both eutectic phases for all the growth rates. The size of the phases was strongly dependent on the growth rate, the eutectic interspacing decreasing from 4.5μm at the lowest growth rate to 600nm at 750mm/h. The optical transmission of the sample with coarser microstructure was measured and compared with that of an Yb3Al5O12 single crystal grown “ad hoc” using the same method. The apparent “oscillator strength” of the single 2F7/2→2F5/2 Yb3+ absorption band was larger in the eutectic sample than in the single crystal, which was attributed to the increase in the light path caused by multiple refractions at the eutectic interphases. The thermal emission of the eutectic rod was studied between 1000°C and 1500°C. An intense and relatively narrow emission band at about 1μm corresponding to the 2F5/2→2F7/2 Yb3+ electronic transition was observed in the whole temperature range. The intensity of the band increased with the temperature up to about 1300°C. At higher temperatures a saturation of the selective emission was observed which was attributed to the competition between the increase in the thermal population of the excited state and the enhancement of the non-radiative de-excitation channels with the temperature.

Abstract: Silicon solar cells featuring carrier selective contacts have been demonstrated to reach ultra-high conversion efficiency. In this work, the electron-selective contact characteristics of ultrathin TiOx films deposited by atomic layer deposition on silicon are investigated via simultaneous consideration of the surface passivation quality and the contact resistivity. Thin TiOx films are demonstrated to provide not only good passivation to silicon surfaces, but also allow a relative low contact resistivity at the TiOx/Si heterojunction. A maximum implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of ~703mV is achieved with the passivation of a 4.5nm TiOx film, and a relatively low contact resistivity of (~0.25Ωcm2 is obtained at the TiOx/n-Si heterojunction simultaneously. N-type silicon solar cell with the champion efficiency of 20.5% is achieved by the implementation of a full-area electron-selective TiOx contacts. A simulated efficiency of up to 23.7% is achieved on the n-type solar cell with a full-area TiOx contact. The efficient, low cost electron-transporting/hole-blocking TiOx layer enables the fabrication of high efficiency silicon solar cells with a simplified process flow.

Abstract: Based on energy band matching between RuO2 and TiO2, the RuO2/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures are designed and fabricated. The formed heterostructures can efficiently enhance the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and accelerate the transport of charges. Thanks to above-mentioned advantages, the RuO2/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures exhibit an improved photocatalytic performance compared with P25, TiO2, and RuO2 under UV and visible light irradiation.

Abstract: In this work, hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon germanium (µc-Si1−xGex:H) thin films were fabricated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and developed as the infrared absorber for thin film silicon solar cells. Three kinds of the non-uniform distribution in µc-Si1−xGex:H thin films including: “the non-uniform distribution of Si and Ge”, the non-uniform distribution of crystallization”, and “the non-uniform distribution of H”, and how these affect the structural, optical and photoelectric properties of µc-Si1−xGex:H thin films have been explored. The results show that the good film quality of µc-Si1−xGex:H is associated with the low crystalline volume fraction and microstructure factor. The band gap of µc-Si1−xGex:H is determined by the proportion of the Ge-related crystalline networks. In addition, it is suggested that the deterioration of the photosensitivity of µc-Si1−xGex:H is mainly due to the increase of the Ge clusters with higher micro-void and defect density. Furthermore, by using µc-Si1−xGex:H bottom sub-cells, the comparable efficiency can be realized under the thin thickness condition. An efficiency of 11.35% in an a-Si:H/a-Si0.6Ge0.4:H/µc-Si0.5Ge0.5:H triple junction structure with total cell thickness as thin as 1200nm was obtained. It is believed that the µc-Si1−xGex:H thin films can be a better candidate for effective infrared absorber by further improving its microstructure uniformity.

Abstract: Ordered mesoporous titania present optimum optical and electronic characteristics for solar cells applications. Hybrid solar cells that combine a dye polymer and porous titania is being studied as an inexpensive alternative to solid state photoconversion devices and the role of the inorganic/organic interface is relevant to understanding the efficiency parameters. Many reports have described UV enhancement and light soaking effects for solid state hybrid cells containing titania. In this work, we study devices fabricated by incorporating P3HT into the ordered pores of a sol-gel synthesized nanocrystalline titania. We observe that the spectral response is modified upon illumination at different wavelengths. When irradiated with UV light (below 370nm), the spectral response is drastically enhanced but when shined with visible light, the external quantum efficiency is reduced. Both effects are reversible such that several enhancement/degradation cycles can be performed. The detrimental visible light effect takes longer than the UV enhancement, which suggests a polymer mediated mechanism. Upon AM 1.5 illumination, both opposing effects are present and results in a Jsc that is sensitive to the measuring time and the test irradiation spectrum.

Abstract: In this study, the electrochromic property of vinyl benzyl viologen (VBV) was first investigated and incorporated in an electrochromic device (ECD). The polymerizable vinyl moiety of VBV enables a self-immobilization through UV-curing under potential bias. Immobilized VBV (I-VBV) was obtained on the electrode and grafted with polymer electrolyte. An ECD consisted of Prussian blue (PB), I-VBV, and ferrocene (Fc) was fabricated (PB/Fc/I-VBV ECD) in which Fc acted as a redox mediator. With the utilization of polymer electrolyte, Fc, and immobilization of VBV, the proposed PB/Fc/I-VBV ECD with a UV-curing time of 40s (PB/Fc/I-VBV-40) exhibited the best cell performance among all conditions in terms of long-term stability. It gives 60.6% transmittance change (∆T) at 615nm initially when switched between 1.2V and −0.8V. Short bleaching and coloring times of 1.32s and 2.13s were achieved respectively. Moreover, good long-term stability was obtained, maintaining 86.5% of its original ∆T after 10,000 cycles. The PB/Fc/I-VBV ECD also exhibited a unique memory characteristic among all viologens-based ECDs reported in literatures and allowed the possibility for tuneable multi-electrochromism.

Abstract: Herein, we present, for the first time, the features of a full solid-state electrochromic (EC) device fabricated on a single substrate, made of glass as well as flexible plastic, adopting a low-cost, eco-friendly, and facile fabrication process. By combining a solution processing of Nafion electrolyte film and RF sputtering deposition at room temperature (RT) on Nafion, we obtained monolithic systems with a simplified architecture (substrate/ITO/WO3/Nafion/ITO) in which a suitable Nafion film (8µm thick) tightly shares its interfaces with the WO3 layer and the highly transparent and conductive RF-sputtered ITO film. Compared to conventional sandwich-type EC devices using semi-solid or liquid electrolytes, the resulting devices exhibited a strong enhancement in terms of interface properties, robustness, cyclic stability, and long-term durability (at least 1000 chronoamperometric cycles). Moreover, electro-optical characterizations highlighted high transmittance modulation (49% at 650nm), astonishing results in terms of coloration efficiency (139cm2/C), and low energy absorption (80mWs/cm2).

Abstract: The use of the upconversion emission in Tm3+ doped glasses for solar applications has been analyzed. The Tm3+ ions, that absorb photons from the near infrared range, perform an energy transfer upconversion process from the 3F4 intermediate energy level to the 3H4 excited state followed by the radiative emission of photons at 800nm, which correspond to the 3H4→3H6 electronic transition. These photons can be absorbed by a silicon solar cell and hence be used in the generation of photocurrent. From the analysis of the rate equations that describes the emission of the 800nm photons, the dependence of the External Quantum Efficiency with the solar concentration value has been obtained.

Abstract: We found a clear correlation between the solar conversion efficiency and the distribution of the ZnS secondary phase in Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) solar cells. Five CZTS solar cells were prepared by the two-step process in which sputtered precursor multilayers were sulfurized at different temperatures. In higher efficiency solar cells, the ZnS secondary phase was found to accumulate near the interface between CZTS and MoS2 formed on top of the Mo layer. It was also found that a solar cell with a higher efficiency showed weaker ZnS Raman signal in the MoS2 layer. The highest conversion efficiency of 7.5% was obtained from a solar cell prepared at a sulfurization temperature of 570°C, in which no ZnS was detected in the MoS2 layer. We suggest that in order to obtain a high efficiency CZTS solar cell, it is critical to find a condition that keeps ZnS from the MoS2 layer.

Abstract: In this work, we prepared four star-shaped conjugated small molecules, the triphenylamine dithiophene (TBT) derivatives, namely TBT-H, TBT-Br, TBT-OH, and TBT-N3 presenting hydride, bromide, hydroxyl, and azide terminal functional groups, respectively. These TBT derivatives were used as additives in the active layers of organic photovoltaics to investigate the effect of intermolecular interactions (TBT-H, TBT-OH) or crosslinking (TBT-N3, TBT-Br) on the long-term thermal stability of the devices. From analyses of blend film morphologies, and optoelectronic and device performance, we observed significant enhancements in thermal stability during accelerated heating tests at 150°C for the devices incorporated with the additives TBT-N3 and TBT-Br. These two additives functioned as crosslinkers, and constructed local borders that effectively impeded heat-promoted fullerene aggregation, thereby leading to highly stable morphologies. When compared with corresponding normal devices, the TBT-N3–derived devices based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) exhibited greater stability, with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) remaining as high as 2.5% after 144h at 150°C. Because of this enhancement, a device based on an amorphous low-bandgap polymer, namely poly(thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene), with the addition of TBT-N3 was fabricated. We observed a significant improvement in device stability, retaining approximately 60% (from 5.0 to 3.3%) of its initial PCE under accelerated heating (150°C). In contrast, the PCE of the corresponding normal device decayed to 0.01% of its initial value.

Abstract: In this work we present a significant advancement in cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) growth in terms of crystal quality and domain size, and indicate its potential use in photovoltaics. To date, the use of 3C-SiC for photovoltaics has not been considered due to the band gap of 2.3eV being too large for conventional solar cells. Doping of 3C-SiC with boron introduces an energy level of 0.7eV above the valence band. Such energy level may form an intermediate band (IB) in the band gap. This IB concept has been presented in the literature to act as an energy ladder that allows absorption of sub-bandgap photons to generate extra electron–hole pairs and increase the efficiency of a solar cell. The main challenge with this concept is to find a materials system that could realize such efficient photovoltaic behavior. The 3C-SiC bandgap and boron energy level fits nicely into the concept, but has not been explored for an IB behavior. For a long time crystalline 3C-SiC has been challenging to grow due to its metastable nature. The material mainly consists of a large number of small domains if the 3C polytype is maintained. In our work a crystal growth process was realized by a new approach that is a combination of initial nucleation and step-flow growth. In the process, the domains that form initially extend laterally to make larger 3C-SiC domains, thus leading to a pronounced improvement in crystalline quality of 3C-SiC. In order to explore the feasibility of IB in 3C-SiC using boron, we have explored two routes of introducing boron impurities; ion implantation on un-doped samples and epitaxial growth on un-doped samples using pre-doped source material. The results show that 3C-SiC doped with boron is an optically active material, and thus is interesting to be further studied for IB behavior. For the ion implanted samples the crystal quality was maintained even after high implantation doses and subsequent annealing. The same was true for the samples grown with pre-doped source material, even with a high concentration of boron impurities. We present optical emission and absorption properties of as-grown and boron implanted 3C-SiC. The low-temperature photoluminescence spectra indicate the formation of optically active deep boron centers, which may be utilized for achieving an IB behavior at sufficiently high dopant concentrations. We also discuss the potential of boron doped 3C-SiC base material in a broader range of applications, such as in photovoltaics, biomarkers and hydrogen generation by splitting water.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a versatile electrospraying method that allows for the rapid uptake of dye molecules on the surfaces of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) for speeding up the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The proposed method both significantly speeds up the dye molecule adsorption process and increases the amount of dye adsorbed. We systematically investigated the effects of the applied voltage and the substrate heating temperature during the electrospraying of the dye-molecule-containing solution on the photovoltaic performance of the resulting DSSCs in terms of their open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The electrospraying method reduced the length of the dye adsorption process by several hours and is almost 10 times faster than the conventional dip-coating method for depositing dye molecules on the surfaces of the TiO2 NPs in the photoelectrodes of DSSCs. This was because of the electrostatic force of attraction between the dye molecules and the TiO2 NPs. The PCE of the resulting DSSCs (4.68% for a photoactive area of 0.36cm2), which were assembled by electrospraying for 3h, was higher than that of DSSCs assembled by dip coating for 30h (4.28% for a photoactive area of 0.36cm2), owing to the fact that the amount of dye adsorbed in the former case was much higher.

Abstract: Obesity is known to be a poorer prognosis factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Among the diverse endocrine factors associated to obesity, leptin has received special attention since it promotes breast cancer cell growth and invasiveness, processes which force cells to adapt their metabolism to satisfy the increased demands of energy and biosynthetic intermediates. Taking this into account, our aim was to explore the effects of leptin in the metabolism of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Polarographic analysis revealed that leptin increased oxygen consumption rate and cellular ATP levels were more dependent on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in leptin-treated cells compared to the more glycolytic control cells. Experiments with selective inhibitors of glycolysis (2-DG), fatty acid oxidation (etomoxir) or aminoacid deprivation showed that ATP levels were more reliant on fatty acid oxidation. In agreement, levels of key proteins involved in lipid catabolism (FAT/CD36, CPT1, PPARα) and phosphorylation of the energy sensor AMPK were increased by leptin. Regarding glucose, cellular uptake was not affected by leptin, but lactate release was deeply repressed. Analysis of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) together with the pentose-phosphate pathway enzyme glucose-6 phoshate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) revealed that leptin favors the use of glucose for biosynthesis. These results point towards a role of leptin in metabolic reprogramming, consisting of an enhanced use of glucose for biosynthesis and lipids for energy production. This metabolic adaptations induced by leptin may provide benefits for MCF-7 growth and give support to the reverse Warburg effect described in breast cancer.

Abstract: Moisture ingress into photovoltaic modules can be detrimental to the expected lifetime of the photovoltaic device. Hence, better understanding of this process and ways to predict the lifetime of a module are of high importance. Moisture ingress occurs through the polymeric materials used in a PV module, especially through the encapsulant which contacts all the sensitive parts in the module. In this work material parameters of polyvinyl butyral, an encapsulant mostly used for glass–glass modules, are presented and an examination of its lateral moisture transport and uptake behavior was undertaken to attain parameters for use in simulations. The uptake of moisture followed Fickian behavior. The absorption isotherm found was of Type III according to the classification by Brunauer, Emmett and Teller.

Abstract: Electron collection layer (ECL) is one of the most important fundamentals to determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) in organometal halide-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we prepared ZnO–SnO2 nanocomposites with different Zn/Sn ratios at low temperature as ECLs for CH3NH3PbI3-based planar-structured PSCs. ZnO–SnO2 nanocomposite with the optimal ~89mol% of the ZnO content gives higher PCE than the ZnO for the best fabricated PSC. The photoluminescence spectroscopies measured in both steady and transient states and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were carried out to characterize the interface of CH3NH3PbI3 and different ECLs, namely ZnO, ZnO–SnO2 composite, and SnO2. The high PCE of PSCs based on the ZnO–SnO2 nanocomposite ECL was thus attributed to joint contributions of the high charge extraction efficiency and large charge recombination resistance both on the CH3NH3PbI3/ECL interface. The thermal stability of CH3NH3PbI3 absorber and the device stability of the corresponding PSC are both dependent on the ECLs in the order: SnO2>ZnO–SnO2 >ZnO, suggesting that the hydroxyl-induced degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 may be predominant in the ambient air environment in the initial ~700h. The PCE of the optimized device was further improved to 15.2% by introducing the low-temperature processable Al2O3 as a capping layer to the ZnO–SnO2 composite.

Abstract: Using first principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), the electronic properties of SnO2 bulk and thin films are studied. The electronic band structures and total energy over a range of SnO2-multilayer have been studied using DFT within the local density approximation (LDA). We show that changing the interatomic distances and relative positions of atoms could modify the band-gap energy of SnO2 semiconductors. Electronic-structure calculations show that band-gap engineering is a powerful technique for the design of new promising candidates with a direct band-gap. Our results present an important advancement toward controlling the band structure and optoelectronic properties of few-layer SnO2 via strain engineering, with important implications for practical device applications.

Abstract: Transparent Electrodes consisting of silver (Ag) nanowires (NWs) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated by spin-coating. Thus, we demonstrated that by embedding AgNWs into the ZnO NPs, we fabricated a transparent multilayer electrode ZnO NPs/AgNWs/ZnO NPs (ZAZ) with a sheet resistance of 13Ω/sq and an optical transparency of 88%. The optical properties of the ZAZ structure were investigated and calculated using a FDTD method. The modeling results showed a good agreement with the experimental results. Plasmonic behavior is highlighted. The ZAZ multilayer electrodes were experimentally optimized and were successfully integrated into an inverted organic solar cell based on P3HT:PCBM. A photovoltaic efficiency of 3.53% is obtained on the ITO-free organic solar cells (OSC) and is compared to traditional ITO-based devices with an efficiency of 3.16%. Numerical calculations of the intrinsic absorption of the active layer inside an organic solar cell integrating either ZAZ or ITO are performed. Moreover, we explored numerically, the plasmonic effect created by the AgNWs and how it can influence the absorption inside the active layer of solar cells, in order to take advantage of its electromagnetic field increases. We demonstrate that ZAZ electrodes are a promising alternative to conventional ITO films for high performance inverted OSCs due to better transmission and beneficial plasmonic effect.

Abstract: The current treatment therapies available for malignant gliomas are inadequate. There is an urgent need to develop more effective therapies by characterizing the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Over expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) ligands and receptors have been reported in malignant gliomas. Platelet-derived growth factor associated protein-1 (PDAP-1) is reported to modulate the mitogenic activity of PDGF ligands, but to date, there is no information concerning its role in PDGF-mediated glioma cell proliferation. This study aimed to characterize the role of PDAP-1 in PDGF-mediated glioma proliferation. The expression of PDAP-1 was observed to be significantly increased (p<0.05) in grade IV glioma tissue and cell lines compared to grade III. siRNA-mediated knockdown of PDAP-1 reduced the expression of PDGF-B and its downstream genes (Akt1/Protein kinase B (PKB) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) by up to 50%. In PDAP-1 knockdown glioma cells, more than a twofold reduction was also observed in the level of phosphorylated Akt. Interestingly, knockdown of PDAP-1 in combination with PDGF-B antibody inhibited glioma cell proliferation through activation of Caspase 3/7 and 9. We also demonstrate that PDAP-1 co-localizes with PDGF-B in the cytoplasm of glioma cells, and an interaction between both of the proteins was established. Collectively, these findings suggest that the expression of PDAP-1 is associated with disease malignancy, and its inhibition reduced the proliferation of malignant glioma cells through down-regulation of PDGF-B/Akt/PDK1 signaling. Thus, this study establishes PDAP-1 as an effecter of PDGF signaling in glioma cells and suggests that it could also be a promising therapeutic target.

Abstract: A novel process was developed to prepare a sequentially stacked CuGa/In precursor using DC magnetron sputtering to make absorber for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell. Compared with precursor made of normally used single-layer In, CuGa/In film with bi-layer In was found to be with smoother surface and better coverage of the CuGa film by In islands. CIGS absorber prepared by selenizing the precursor with bi-layer In film showed a surface with less roughness, which indicated strong influence of the surface texture of the precursor on the morphology of the absorber. Furthermore, the thickness inhomogeneity of the In islands on the CuGa layer in the precursor was found to induce different degree of mixing for Ga and In, resulting in a lateral composition fluctuation among CIGS grains in addition to the normally observed vertical Ga grading in each grain. By using a precursor with bi-layer In film, an improvement of cell efficiency is always obtained resulting from the increased open circuit voltage (Voc) and larger fill factor (FF).
