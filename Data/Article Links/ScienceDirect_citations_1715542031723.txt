Abstract: In mammalian cells the nuclear-encoded subunits of complex I are imported into mitochondria, where they are assembled with mt-DNA encoded subunits in the complex, or exchanged with pre-existing copies in the complex. The present work shows that in fibroblast cultures inhibition by KH7 of cAMP production in the mitochondrial matrix by soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) results in decreased amounts of free non-incorporated nuclear-encoded NDUFS4, NDUFV2 and NDUFA9 subunits of the catalytic moiety and inhibition of the activity of complex I. Addition of permeant 8-Br-cAMP prevents this effect of KH7. KH7 inhibits accumulation in isolated rat-liver mitochondria and incorporation in complex I of “in vitro” produced, radiolabeled NDUFS4 and NDUFV2 subunits. 8-Br-cAMP prevents also this effect of KH7. Use of protease inhibitors shows that intramitochondrial cAMP exerts this positive effect on complex I by preventing digestion of nuclear-encoded subunits by mitochondrial protease(s), whose activity is promoted by KH7 and H89, an inhibitor of PKA.

Abstract: The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) has been shown to cluster both before and upon engagement with cognate antigens. However, the effect of TCR clustering on its activation remains poorly understood. Here, we used two-color photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM) to visualize individual molecules of TCR and ZAP-70, as a marker of TCR activation and phosphorylation, at the plasma membrane of uniformly activated T cells. Imaging and second-order statistics revealed that ZAP-70 recruitment and TCR activation localized inside TCR clusters. Live cell PALM imaging showed that the extent of localized TCR activation decreased, yet remained significant, with cell spreading. Using dynamic modeling and Monte-Carlo simulations we evaluated possible mechanisms of localized TCR activation. Our simulations indicate that localized TCR activation is the result of long-range cooperative interactions between activated TCRs, or localized activation by Lck and Fyn. Our results demonstrate the role of molecular clustering in cell signaling and activation, and are relevant to studying a wide range of multi-molecular complexes.

Abstract: CD38 catalyzes the synthesis of two structurally distinct messengers for Ca2+-mobilization, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), from cytosolic substrates, NAD and NADP, respectively. CD38 is generally thought of as a type II membrane protein with its catalytic site facing outside. We recently showed that CD38 exists, instead, in two opposite membrane orientations. The determinant for the membrane topology is unknown. Here, specific antibodies against type III CD38 were designed and produced. We show that mutating the positively charged residues in the N-terminal tail of CD38 converted its orientation to type III, with the catalytic domain facing the cytosol and it was fully active in producing intracellular cADPR. Changing the serine residues to aspartate, which is functionally equivalent to phosphorylation, had a similar effect. The mutated CD38 was expressed intracellularly and was un-glycosylated. The membrane topology could also be modulated by changing the highly conserved di-cysteine. The results indicate that the net charge of the N-terminal segment is important in determining the membrane topology of CD38 and that the type III orientation can be a functional form of CD38 for Ca2+-signaling.

Abstract: Regulation of mRNA decay plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional control of cell growth, survival, differentiation, death and senescence. Deadenylation is a rate-limiting step in the silence and degradation of the bulk of highly regulated mRNAs. However, the physiological functions of various deadenylases have not been fully deciphered. In this research, we found that poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) was upregulated in gastric tumor tissues and gastric cancer cell lines MKN28 and AGS. The cellular function of PARN was investigated by stably knocking down the endogenous PARN in the MKN28 and AGS cells. Our results showed that PARN-depletion significantly inhibited the proliferation of the two types of gastric cancer cells and promoted cell death, but did not significantly affect cell motility and invasion. The depletion of PARN arrested the gastric cancer cells at the G0/G1 phase by upregulating the expression levels of p53 and p21 but not p27. The mRNA stability of p53 was unaffected by PARN-knockdown in both types of cells. A significant stabilizing effect of PARN-depletion on p21 mRNA was observed in the AGS cells but not in the MKN28 cells. We further showed that the p21 3′-UTR triggered the action of PARN in the AGS cells. The dissimilar observations between the MKN28 and AGS cells as well as various stress conditions suggested that the action of PARN strongly relied on protein expression profiles of the cells, which led to heterogeneity in the stability of PARN-targeted mRNAs.

Abstract: ABCG2, a metabolite and xenobiotic transporter located at the plasma membrane (predominantly in barrier tissues and progenitor cells), undergoes a direct progressive endocytosis process from plasma membrane to intracellular compartments upon binding of 5D3 monoclonal antibody. This antibody is specific to an external epitope on the protein molecule and locks it in a discrete conformation within its activity cycle, presumably providing a structural trigger for the observed internalization phenomenon. Using routine and novel assays, we show that ABCG2 is endocytosed by a mixed mechanism: partially via a rapid, clathrin-dependent pathway and partially in a cholesterol-dependent, caveolin-independent manner. While the internalization process is entirely dynamin-dependent and converges initially at the early endosome, subsequent intracellular fate of ABCG2 is again twofold: endocytosis leads to only partial lysosomal degradation, while a significant fraction of the protein is retained in a post-endosomal compartment with the possibility of at least partial recycling back to the cell surface. This externally triggered, conformation-related trafficking pathway may serve as a general regulatory paradigm for membrane transporters, and its discovery was made possible thanks to consistent application of quantitative methods.

Abstract: The actin cytoskeleton is substantially modified in cancer cells because of changes in actin-binding protein abundance and functional activity. As a consequence, cancer cells have distinctive motility and mechanical properties, which are important for many processes, including invasion and metastasis. Here, we studied the effects of actin cytoskeleton alterations induced by specific nucleation inhibitors (SMIFH2, CK-666), cytochalasin D, Y-27632 and detachment from the surface by trypsinization on the mechanical properties of normal Vero and prostate cancer cell line DU145. The Young's modulus of Vero cells was 1300±900Pa, while the prostate cancer cell line DU145 exhibited significantly lower Young's moduli (600±400Pa). The Young's moduli exhibited a log-normal distribution for both cell lines. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells demonstrated diverse viscoelastic behavior and different responses to actin cytoskeleton reorganization. They were more resistant to specific formin-dependent nucleation inhibition, and reinforced their cortical actin after detachment from the substrate.

Abstract: The evolutionarily conserved PIKfyve, which synthesizes PtdIns5P from PtdIns, and PtdIns(3,5)P2 from PtdIns3P, requires PtdIns3P as both an enzyme substrate and a membrane recruitment signal. Whereas the PtdIns3P source is undetermined, class III PI3K (Vps34), the only evolutionarily conserved of the eight mammalian PI3Ks, is presumed as a main candidate. A hallmark of PIKfyve deficiency is formation of multiple translucent cytoplasmic vacuoles seen by light microscopy in cells cultured in complete media. Such an aberrant phenotype is often observed in cells from conditional Vps34 knockout (KO) mice. To clarify the mechanism of Vps34 KO-triggered vacuolation and the PtdIns3P source for PIKfyve functionality, here we have characterized a podocyte cell type derived from Vps34fl/fl mice, which, upon Cre-mediated gene KO, robustly formed cytoplasmic vacuoles resembling those in PikfyveKO MEFs. Vps34wt, expressed in Vps34KO podocytes restored the normal morphology, but only if the endogenous PIKfyve activity was intact. Conversely, expressed PIKfyvewt rescued completely the vacuolation only in PikfyveKO MEFs but not in Vps34KO podocytes. Analyses of phosphoinositide profiles by HPLC and localization patterns by a PtdIns3P biosensor revealed that Vps34 is the main supplier of localized PtdIns3P not only for PIKfyve activity but also for membrane recruitment. Concordantly, Vps34KO podocytes had severely reduced steady-state levels of both PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns5P, along with PtdIns3P. We further revealed a plausible physiologically-relevant Vps34-independent PtdIns3P supply for PIKfyve, operating through activated class I PI3Ks. Our data provide the first evidence that the vacuolation phenotype in Vps34KO podocytes is due to PIKfyve dysfunction and that Vps34 is a main PtdIns3P source for constitutive PIKfyve functionality.

Abstract: The Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) tumor suppressor has been previously implicated in the control of apical–basal polarity; yet, the consequence of APC loss-of-function in epithelial polarization and morphogenesis has not been characterized. To test the hypothesis that APC is required for the establishment of normal epithelial polarity and morphogenesis programs, we generated APC-knockdown epithelial cell lines. APC depletion resulted in loss of polarity and multi-layering on permeable supports, and enlarged, filled spheroids with disrupted polarity in 3D culture. Importantly, these effects of APC knockdown were independent of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, but were rescued with either full-length or a carboxy (c)-terminal segment of APC. Moreover, we identified a gene expression signature associated with APC knockdown that points to several candidates known to regulate cell–cell and cell–matrix communication. Analysis of epithelial tissues from mice and humans carrying heterozygous APC mutations further supports the importance of APC as a regulator of epithelial behavior and tissue architecture. These data also suggest that the initiation of epithelial-derived tumors as a result of APC mutation or gene silencing may be driven by loss of polarity and dysmorphogenesis.

Abstract: Novel insights in nanoparticle (NP) uptake routes of cells, their intracellular trafficking and subcellular targeting can be obtained through the investigation of their temporal and spatial behavior. In this work, we present the application of image (cross-) correlation spectroscopy (IC(C)S) and single particle tracking (SPT) to monitor the intracellular dynamics of polystyrene (PS) NPs in the human lung carcinoma A549 cell line. The ensemble kinetic behavior of NPs inside the cell was characterized by temporal and spatiotemporal image correlation spectroscopy (TICS and STICS). Moreover, a more direct interpretation of the diffusion and flow detected in the NP motion was obtained by SPT by monitoring individual NPs. Both techniques demonstrate that the PS NP transport in A549 cells is mainly dependent on microtubule-assisted transport. By applying spatiotemporal image cross-correlation spectroscopy (STICCS), the correlated motions of NPs with the early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes are identified. PS NPs were equally distributed among the endolysosomal compartment during the time interval of the experiments. The cotransport of the NPs with the lysosomes is significantly larger compared to the other cell organelles. In the present study we show that the complementarity of ICS-based techniques and SPT enables a consistent elaborate model of the complex behavior of NPs inside biological systems.

Abstract: The homeostasis of magnesium (Mg2+), an abundant divalent cation indispensable for many biological processes including mitochondrial functions, is underexplored. Previously, two mitochondrial Mg2+ importers, Mrs2 and Lpe10, were characterized for mitochondrial Mg2+ uptake. We now show that mitochondrial Mg2+ homeostasis is accurately controlled through the combined effects of previously known importers and a novel exporter, Mme1 (mitochondrial magnesium exporter 1). Mme1 belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family and was isolated for its mutation that is able to suppress the mrs2Δ respiration defect. Deletion of MME1 significantly increased steady-state mitochondrial Mg2+ concentration, while overexpression decreased it. Measurements of Mg2+ exit from proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified Mme1 provided definite evidence for Mme1 as an Mg2+ exporter. Our studies identified, for the first time, a mitochondrial Mg2+ exporter that works together with mitochondrial importers to ensure the precise control of mitochondrial Mg2+ homeostasis.

Abstract: Protein kinase C (PKC) and galectin-3 are two important mediators that play a key pathogenic role in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF). However, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways are not fully understood. In this study, we explored the relationship between and roles of PKC-α and galectin-3 in the development of HF. We found that activation of PKC by phorbol dibutyrate (PDB) increased galectin-3 expression by ~180%, as well as collagen I and fibronection accumulation in cultured HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Over-expression of galectin-3 in HL-1 cells increased collagen I protein production. Inhibition of galectin-3 by β-lactose blocked PDB-induced galectin-3 and collagen production, indicating that galectin-3 mediates PKC-induced cardiac fibrosis. In rats subjected to pulmonary artery banding (PAB) to induce right ventricular HF, galectin-3 was increased by ~140% in the right ventricle and also by ~240% in left ventricle compared to control. The elevated galectin-3 is consistent with an increase of total and activated (phosphorylated) PKC-α, α-SMA and collagen I. Finally, we extended our findings to examine the role of angiotensin II (Ang II), which activates the PKC pathway and contributes to cardiac fibrosis and the development of HF. We found that Ang II activated the PKC-α pathway and increased galectin-3 expression and collagen production. This study provides a new insight into the molecular mechanisms of HF mediated by PKC-α and galectin-3. PKC-α promotes cardiac fibrosis and HF by stimulation of galectin-3 expression.

Abstract: The dynamics of formation of macromolecular structures in adherent membranes is a key to a number of cellular processes. However, the interplay between protein reaction kinetics, diffusion and the morphology of the growing domains, governed by membrane mediated interactions, is still poorly understood. Here we show, experimentally and in simulations, that a rich phase diagram emerges from the competition between binding, cooperativity, molecular crowding and membrane spreading. In the cellular context, the spontaneously-occurring organization of adhesion domains in ring-like morphologies is particularly interesting. These are stabilized by the crowding of bulky proteins, and the membrane-transmitted correlations between bonds. Depending on the density of the receptors, this phase may be circumvented, and instead, the adhesions may grow homogeneously in the contact zone between two membranes. If the development of adhesion occurs simultaneously with membrane spreading, much higher accumulation of binders can be achieved depending on the velocity of spreading. The mechanisms identified here, in the context of our mimetic model, may shed light on the structuring of adhesions in the contact zones between two living cells.

Abstract: Cyclopeptide RA-V has potent anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activities, but its potential anti-metastatic activity is unknown. Cancer cells acquire invasive ability to degrade and adhere to extracellular matrix (ECM), allowing them to migrate to adjacent tissues and ultimately metastasize. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of RA-V on cell adhesion, migration, invasion and matrix degradation, and its underlying mechanism in two human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (ER-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (ER-negative). Our results demonstrated that RA-V (12.5nM) can significantly inhibit breast cancer cell adhesion and migration via interfering cofilin signaling and chemokine receptors involved in cell migration. RA-V reduced the expressions of vascular intracellular adhesion molecule (VCAM), intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and integrins. The activities and expressions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and urokinase-type of plasminogen activator (uPA) were also inhibited by RA-V. Furthermore, RA-V inhibits the expressions of EGFR, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling molecules, and reduces the binding of β-estradiol to ER via affecting binding ability of ER in MCF-7 cells. RA-V inhibits breast cancer cell migration, adhesion and ECM degradation in vitro, implying that RA-V is a potential anti-metastatic agent in breast cancer, and likely acts via PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways in both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells.

Abstract: In the last decade an increasing number of plasma membrane (PM) proteins have been shown to be non-randomly distributed but instead forming submicron-sized oligomers called nanoclusters. Nanoclusters exist independently of the ligand-bound state of the receptors and their existence implies a high degree of lateral organisation of the PM and its proteins. The mechanisms that drive receptor nanoclustering are largely unknown. One well-defined example of a transmembrane receptor that forms nanoclusters is the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), a multisubunit protein complex whose nanoclustering influences its activity. Membrane lipids, namely cholesterol and sphingomyelin, have been shown to contribute to TCR nanoclustering. However, the identity of the membrane microdomain in which the TCR resides remains controversial. Using a GFP-labeled TCR we show here that the resting TCR localized in the disordered domain of giant PM vesicles (GPMVs) and PM spheres (PMSs) and that single and nanoclustered TCRs are found in the high-density fractions in sucrose gradients. Both findings are indicative of non-raft localization. We discuss possible mechanisms of TCR nanoclustering in T cells.

Phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase γ by Akt regulates its interaction with talin and focal adhesion dynamics,

Abstract: The type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) family members and their lipid product, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) are important regulators of actin cytoskeleton. PIP5Kγ 90kDa (PIP5Kγ90), an isoform of PIP5K, localizes to focal adhesions (FAs) and is activated via its interaction with the cytoskeletal protein, talin. Currently, regulatory signaling pathways of talin–PIP5Kγ90 interaction related to FA dynamics and cell motility are not well understood. Considering the presence of Akt consensus motifs in PIP5Kγ90, we examined a potential link of Akt activation to talin–PIP5Kγ90 interaction. We found that Akt phosphorylated PIP5Kγ90 specifically at serine 555 (S555) in vitro and in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-treated cells phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependently. EGF treatment suppressed talin–PIP5Kγ90 interaction and PIP2 levels. Similarly, a phosphomimetic mutant (S555D), but not non-phosphorylatable mutant (S555A), of PIP5Kγ90 had reduced talin binding affinity, lowered PIP2 levels, and was dislocated from FAs. The S555D mutant also caused decreases in actin stress fibers and vinculin-positive FAs. Moreover, assembly and disassembly of FAs were enhanced by S555D expression and EGF-induced cell migration was relatively low in S555A-expressing cells compared to wild-type-expressing cells. PIP5Kγ87, a PIP5Kγ splice variant lacking the talin binding motif, was phosphorylated by Akt, which, however, hardly affected PIP2 levels. Taken together, our results suggested that Akt-mediated PIP5Kγ90 S555 phosphorylation is a novel regulatory point for talin binding to control PIP2 level at the FAs, thereby modulating FA dynamics and cell motility.

Abstract: Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of the African sleeping sickness of humans, and other kinetoplastid flagellates belong to the eukarytotic supergroup Excavata. This early-branching model protist is known for a broad range of unique features. As it is amenable to most techniques of forward and reverse genetics, T. brucei was subject to several studies of its iron-sulfur (Fe/S) protein biogenesis and thus represents the best studied excavate eukaryote. Here we review what is known about the Fe/S protein biogenesis of T. brucei, and focus especially on the comparative and evolutionary interesting aspects. We also explore the connections between the well-known and quite conserved ISC and CIA machineries and the tRNA thiolation pathway. Moreover, the Fe/S cluster protein biogenesis is dissected in the procyclic stage of T. brucei which has an active mitochondrion, as well as in its pathogenic bloodstream stage with a metabolically repressed organelle. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Fe/S proteins: Analysis, structure, function, biogenesis and diseases.

Abstract: Pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus strains produce N-formylmethionyl containing peptides, of which the tetrapeptide fMIFL is a potent activator of the neutrophil formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) and the PSMα2 peptide is a potent activator of the closely related FPR2. Variants derived from these two peptide activators were used to disclose the structural determinants for receptor interaction. Removal of five amino acids from the C-terminus of PSMα2 gave rise to a peptide that had lost the receptor-independent neutrophil permeabilizing effect, whereas neutrophil activation capacity as well as its preference for FPR2 was retained. Shorter peptides, PSMα21–10 and PSMα21–5, activate neutrophils, but the receptor preference for these peptides was switched to FPR1. The fMIFL-PSM5–16 peptide, in which the N-terminus of PSMα21–16 was replaced by the sequence fMIFL, was a dual agonist for FPR1/FPR2, whereas fMIFL-PSM5–10 preferred FPR1 to FPR2. Further, an Ile residue was identified as a key determinant for interaction with FPR2. A chimeric receptor in which the cytoplasmic tail of FPR1 was replaced by the corresponding part of FPR2 lost the ability to recognize FPR1 agonists, but gained function in relation to FPR2 agonists. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the C-terminus of the PSMα2 peptide plays a critical role for its cytotoxicity, but is not essential for the receptor-mediated pro-inflammatory activity. More importantly, we show that the amino acids present in the C-terminus, which are not supposed to occupy the agonist-binding pocket in the FPRs, are of importance for the choice of receptor.

Abstract: Cystamine and its reduced form cysteamine showed protective effects in various models of neurodegenerative disease, including Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease. Other lines of evidence demonstrated the cytotoxic effect of cysteamine on duodenal mucosa leading to ulcer development. However, the mechanism for cystamine cytotoxicity remains poorly understood. Here, we report a new pathway in which cystamine induces apoptosis by targeting apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). By screening of various cell lines, we observed that cystamine and cysteamine induce cell death in a cell type-specific manner. Comparison between cystamine-sensitive and cystamine-resistant cell lines revealed that cystamine cytotoxicity is not associated with unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species generation and transglutaminase or caspase activity; rather, it is associated with the ability of cystamine to trigger AIF nuclear translocation. In cystamine-sensitive cells, cystamine suppresses the levels of intracellular glutathione by inhibiting γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase expression that triggers AIF translocation. Conversely, glutathione supplementation completely prevents cystamine-induced AIF translocation and apoptosis. In rats, cysteamine administration induces glutathione depletion and AIF translocation leading to apoptosis of duodenal epithelium. These results indicate that AIF translocation through glutathione depletion is the molecular mechanism of cystamine toxicity, and provide important implications for cystamine in the neurodegenerative disease therapeutics as well as in the regulation of AIF-mediated cell death.

Abstract: CK2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is so important for many aspects of cellular regulation that life without CK2 is impossible. Here, we analysed CK2 during adipogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). With progress of the differentiation CK2 protein level and the kinase activity decreased. Whereas CK2α remained in the nucleus during differentiation, the localization of CK2β showed a dynamic shuttling in the course of differentiation. Over the last years a large number of inhibitors of CK2 kinase activity were generated with the idea to use them in cancer therapy. Our results show that two highly specific inhibitors of CK2, CX-4945 and quinalizarin, reduced its kinase activity in proliferating hMSC with a similar efficiency. CK2 inhibition by quinalizarin resulted in nearly complete inhibition of differentiation whereas, in the presence of CX-4945, differentiation proceeded similar to the controls. In this case, differentiation was accompanied by the loss of CX-4945 inhibitory function. By analysing the subcellular localization of PPARγ2, we found a shift from a nuclear localization at the beginning of differentiation to a more cytoplasmic localization in the presence of quinalizarin. Our data further show for the first time that a certain level of CK2 kinase activity is required for adipogenic stem cell differentiation and that inhibition of CK2 resulted in an altered localization of PPARγ2, an early regulator of differentiation.

Abstract: The differentiation from constantly dividing epithelial cells into secondary fiber cells is a key step during lens development. Failure in this process, which requires cell proliferation inhibition and cell cycle exit, causes cataract formation. HSF4 (Heat Shock Transcription Factor 4) gene mutations may lead to both congenital and senile cataract. However, how HSF4 mutations induce cataract formation remains obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that HSF4 can suppress the proliferation of human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) by promoting G1/S arrest in a p53-dependent manner. In contrast, HSF4 with cataract causative mutations fail to cause cell cycle arrest and have no obvious effect on cell proliferation. We further identify that HSF4 recruits p53 in the nucleus and promotes its transcriptional activity, leading to the expression of its target gene p21 in HLECs. HSF4, but not its cataract-causing mutants, stabilizes p53 protein and inhibits its ubiquitin degradation. Our data reveal that HSF4 may work as a switch between lens epithelial cell proliferation and secondary fiber cell differentiation, a process which mainly depends on p53. Through demonstration of this novel downstream pathway of HSF4, our results help uncover the pathogenic mechanisms caused by HSF4 mutations.

Abstract: Clinical and experimental biomedical studies have shown Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to be a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study demonstrates the effect of metformin, a therapeutic biguanide administered for T2DM therapy, on β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models. Furthermore, the protective role of insulin against metformin is also demonstrated. In LAN5 neuroblastoma cells, metformin increases APP and presenilin levels, proteins involved in AD. Overexpression of APP and presenilin 1 (Pres 1) increases APP cleavage and intracellular accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), which, in turn, promotes aggregation of Aβ. In the experimental conditions utilized the drug causes oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, decrease of Hexokinase-II levels and cytochrome C release, all of which lead to cell death. Several changes in oxidative stress-related genes following metformin treatment were detected by PCR arrays specific for the oxidative stress pathway. These effects of metformin were found to be antagonized by the addition of insulin, which reduced Aβ levels, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Similarly, antioxidant molecules, such as ferulic acid and curcumin, are able to revert metformin's effect. Comparable results were obtained using peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Finally, the involvement of NF-κB transcription factor in regulating APP and Pres 1 expression was investigated. Upon metformin treatment, NF-κB is activated and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it induces increased APP and Pres 1 transcription. The use of Bay11-7085 inhibitor suppressed the effect of metformin on APP and Pres 1 expression.

Abstract: Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations enriched in sterols and sphingolipids. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) is an oncogenic protein that converts sphingosine to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which is a messenger molecule involved in calcium signaling. Caveolae contain calcium responsive proteins, but the effects of SK1 or S1P on caveolar calcium signaling have not been investigated. We generated a Caveolin-1–Aequorin fusion protein (Cav1–Aeq) that can be employed for monitoring the local calcium concentration at the caveolae ([Ca2+]cav). In HeLa cells, Cav1–Aeq reported different [Ca2+] as compared to the plasma membrane [Ca2+] in general (reported by SNAP25–Aeq) or as compared to the cytosolic [Ca2+] (reported by cyt-Aeq). The Ca2+ signals detected by Cav1–Aeq were significantly attenuated when the caveolar structures were disrupted by methyl-β-cyclodextrin, suggesting that the caveolae are specific targets for Ca2+ signaling. HeLa cells overexpressing SK1 showed increased [Ca2+]cav during histamine-induced Ca2+ mobilization in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ as well as during receptor-operated Ca2+ entry (ROCE). The SK1-induced increase in [Ca2+]cav during ROCE was reverted by S1P receptor antagonists. In accordance, pharmacologic inhibition of SK1 reduced the [Ca2+]cav during ROCE. S1P treatment stimulated the [Ca2+]cav upon ROCE. The Ca2+ responses at the plasma membrane in general were not affected by SK1 expression. In summary, our results show that SK1/S1P-signaling regulates Ca2+ signals at the caveolae. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 13th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Protozoan parasites of the family Trypanosomatidae infect humans as well as livestock causing devastating diseases like sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and Leishmaniasis. These parasites compartmentalize glycolytic enzymes within unique organelles, the glycosomes. Glycosomes represent a subclass of peroxisomes and they are essential for the parasite survival. Hence, disruption of glycosome biogenesis is an attractive drug target for these Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). Peroxin 16 (PEX16) plays an essential role in peroxisomal membrane protein targeting and de novo biogenesis of peroxisomes from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We identified trypanosomal PEX16 based on specific sequence characteristics and demonstrate that it is an integral glycosomal membrane protein of procyclic and bloodstream form trypanosomes. RNAi mediated partial knockdown of Trypanosoma brucei PEX16 in bloodstream form trypanosomes led to severe ATP depletion, motility defects and cell death. Microscopic and biochemical analysis revealed drastic reduction in glycosome number and mislocalization of the glycosomal matrix enzymes to the cytosol. Asymmetry of the localization of the remaining glycosomes was observed with a severe depletion in the posterior part. The results demonstrate that trypanosomal PEX16 is essential for glycosome biogenesis and thereby, provides a potential drug target for sleeping sickness and related diseases.

Abstract: The twin-arginine translocation system (Tat) is a protein transport system that moves fully folded and cofactor-containing proteins across membranes of bacteria, archaea and thylakoids. The minimal Tat pathway is composed of two subunits, TatA and TatC. In some organisms TatA has been duplicated and evolved to form a third specialized subunit, TatB. The Bacillus subtilis genome encodes two TatC subunits (TatCd and TatCy) and three TatA subunits (TatAd, TatAy and TatAc). These subunits combine to form two parallel minimal pathways, TatAy-TatCy and TatAd-TatCd. The purpose and role of the third TatA component, TatAc, has remained ambiguous. In this study we examined the translocation of two natively expressed TatAy-TatCy-dependent substrates, EfeB and QcrA, in various Tat-deficient genetic backgrounds. More specifically, we examined the ability of different mutated TatAy subunits to complement for the absence of wild-type TatAy. We further detailed a graded growth phenotype associated with the functional translocation of EfeB. We found that in various instances where specific amino acid substitutions were made in TatAy, a definite TatAc-associated growth phenotype occurred in genetic backgrounds lacking TatAc. Altogether, our findings show that TatAy and TatAc interact and that this TatAy–TatAc interaction, although not essential, supports the translocation of the Tat substrate EfeB when TatAy function is compromised. This implies that the third TatA-like protein in B. subtilis could represent an intermediate evolutionary step in TatA-TatB specialization.

Abstract: Peptide-hormone secretion is partially triggered by Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) and gene inactivation of Zn2+-sensitive Cav2.3-type VGCCs is associated with disturbed glucose homeostasis in mice. Zn2+ has been implicated in pancreatic islet cell crosstalk and recent findings indicate that sudden cessation of Zn2+ supply during hypoglycemia triggers glucagon secretion in rodents. Here we show that diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC), a chelating agent for Zn2+ and other group IIB metal ions, differentially affects blood glucose and serum peptide hormone level in wild-type mice and mice lacking the Cav2.3-subunit. Fasting glucose and glucagon level were significantly higher in Cav2.3-deficient compared to wild-type mice, while DEDTC Zn2+-chelation produced a significant and correlated increase of blood glucose and serum glucagon concentration in wild-type but not Cav2.3-deficient mice. Glucose tolerance tests revealed severe glucose intolerance in Zn2+-depleted Cav2.3-deficient but not vehicle-treated Cav2.3-deficient or Zn2+-depleted wildtype mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that Cav2.3 channels are critically involved in the Zn2+-mediated suppression of glucagon secretion during hyperglycemia. Especially under conditions of Zn2+ deficiency, ablation or dysfunction of Cav2.3 channels may lead to severe disturbances in glucose homeostasis.

Abstract: Numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are glycosylated at extracellular regions. The regulatory roles of glycosylation on receptor function vary across receptor types. In this study, we used the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors as an experimental model to understand the underlying principles governing the functional roles of glycosylation. We used the pharmacological inhibitor, tunicamycin, to inhibit glycosylation, generated chimeric D2 and D3 receptors by swapping their respective N-termini, and produced the glycosylation site mutant D2 and D3 receptors to study the roles of glycosylation on receptor functions, including cell surface expression, signaling, and internalization through specific microdomains. Our results demonstrate that glycosylation on the N-terminus of the D3 receptor is involved in the development of desensitization and proper cell surface expression. In addition, glycosylation on the N-terminus mediates the internalization of D2 and D3 receptors within the caveolae and clathrin-coated pit microdomains of the plasma membrane, respectively, by regulating receptor interactions with caveolin-1 and clathrin. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that glycosylation on the N-terminus of GPCRs is involved in endocytic pathway selection through specific microdomains. These data suggest that changes in the cellular environment that influence posttranslational modification could be an important determinant of intracellular GPCR trafficking.

Abstract: Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and Zyxin are interacting proteins involved in cellular adhesion and motility. PKA phosphorylates VASP at serine 157, regulating VASP cellular functions. VASP interacts with ABL and is a substrate of the BCR–ABL oncoprotein. The presence of BCR–ABL protein drives oncogenesis in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) due to a constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase activity. However, the function of VASP and Zyxin in BCR–ABL pathway and the role of VASP in CML cells remain unknown. In vitro experiments using K562 cells showed the involvement of VASP in BCR–ABL signaling. VASP and Zyxin inhibition decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, BCL2 and BCL-XL. Imatinib induced an increase in phosphorylation at Ser157 of VASP and decreased VASP and BCR–ABL interaction. VASP did not interact with Zyxin in K562 cells; however, after Imatinib treatment, this interaction was restored. Corroborating our data, we demonstrated the absence of phosphorylation at Ser157 in VASP in the bone marrow of CML patients, in contrast to healthy donors. Phosphorylation of VASP on Ser157 was restored in Imatinib responsive patients though not in the resistant patients. Therefore, we herein identified a possible role of VASP in CML pathogenesis, through the regulation of BCR–ABL effector proteins or the absence of phosphorylation at Ser157 in VASP.

Abstract: The inverse correlation between dietary calcium intake and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is well known, but poorly understood. Expression of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a calcium-binding G protein-coupled receptor is downregulated in CRC leading us to hypothesize that the CaSR has tumor suppressive roles in the colon. The aim of this study was to understand whether restoration of CaSR expression could reduce the malignant phenotype in CRC. In human colorectal tumors, expression of the CaSR negatively correlated with proliferation markers whereas loss of CaSR correlated with poor tumor differentiation and reduced apoptotic potential. In vivo, dearth of CaSR significantly increased expression of proliferation markers and decreased levels of differentiation and apoptotic markers in the colons of CaSR/PTH double knock-out mice confirming the tumor suppressive functions of CaSR. In vitro CRC cells stably overexpressing wild-type CaSR showed significant reduction in proliferation, as well as increased differentiation and apoptotic potential. The positive allosteric modulator of CaSR, NPS R-568 further enhanced these effects, whereas treatment with the negative allosteric modulator, NPS 2143 inhibited these functions. Interestingly, the dominant-negative mutant (R185Q) was able to abrogate these effects. Our results demonstrate a critical tumor suppressive role of CaSR in the colon. Restoration of CaSR expression and function is linked to regulation of the balance between proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and provides a rationale for novel strategies in CRC therapy.

Abstract: The cortical cytoskeleton constitutes an important subcellular structure that determines cell shape and regulates cell migration as well as membrane traffic to and from the plasma membrane. Many components of the cortical cytoskeleton have been identified including structural and scaffolding proteins, membrane–cytoskeleton linker proteins and signaling intermediates. We describe here an association of the membrane-F-actin linker protein ezrin with the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 that serves as a hub for concentrating different signaling complexes. Both, ezrin and IQGAP1 bind in a Ca2+-dependent manner to the EF hand protein S100P and complexes consisting of Ca2+-bound S100P, IQGAP1 and ezrin can be isolated by immunoprecipitation. Ezrin and IQGAP1 also interact in the absence of Ca2+, thus independent of S100P. Direct ezrin–IQGAP1 interaction can be shown with the purified proteins. It is mediated via the N-terminal FERM domain of ezrin and the IQ domain of IQGAP1, respectively. Ezrin and IQGAP1 colocalize in the submembraneous cytoskeleton and in cellular protrusions of human epithelial cells and knockdown of ezrin reduces the cortical localization of IQGAP1. Thus, ezrin appears to participate in recruiting IQGAP1 to the cell cortex thereby establishing a close connection between membrane-F-actin contacts and actin regulators that can be assembled by IQGAP1.

Abstract: Oncostatin M (OSM), a cytokine in the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family, has been proposed to play a protective role in the central nervous system, such as attenuation of excitotoxicity induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and glutamate. However, the potential neuroprotective effects of OSM against mitochondrial dysfunction have never been reported. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that OSM may confer neuronal resistance against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), a plant toxin that irreversibly inhibits the complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and characterized the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that OSM preconditioning dose- and time-dependently protected cortical neurons against 3-NP toxicity. OSM stimulated expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member expressed in differentiating myeloid cells, that required prior phosphorylation of Janus kinase-1 (JAK1), JAK2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), STAT1, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Pharmacological inhibitors of JAK1, JAK2, ERK1/2, STAT3, STAT1, and CREB as well as the siRNA targeting at STAT3 and Mcl-1 all abolished OSM-dependent 3-NP resistance. Finally, OSM-dependent Mcl-1 induction contributed to the enhancements of mitochondrial bioenergetics including increases in spare respiratory capacity and ATP production. In conclusion, our findings indicated that OSM induces Mcl-1 expression via activation of ERK1/2, JAK1/2, STAT1/3, and CREB; furthermore, OSM-mediated Mcl-1 induction contributes to bioenergetic improvements and neuroprotective effects against 3-NP toxicity in cortical neurons. OSM may thus serve as a novel neuroprotective agent against mitochondrial dysfunction commonly associated with pathogenic mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Cell fusion process is a critical, rate-limiting step in osteoclastogenesis but the mechanisms that regulate fusopod formation are not defined. We characterized fusopod generation in cultured pre-osteoclasts derived from cells stably transfected with a plasmid that expressed a short, actin filament binding peptide (Lifeact) fused to mEGFP that enables localization of actin filaments in living cells. Fusion was initiated at fusopods, which are cell extensions of width >2μm and that are immunostained for myosin-X at the extension tips. Fusopods formed at the leading edge of larger migrating cells and from the tail of adjacent smaller cells, both of which migrated in the same direction. Staining for DC-STAMP was circumferential and did not localize to cell–cell fusion sites. Compared with wild-type cells, monocytes null for Rac1 exhibited 6-fold fewer fusopods and formed 4-fold fewer multinucleated osteoclasts. From time-lapse images we found that fusion was temporally related to the formation of coherent and spatially isolated bands of actin filaments that originated in cell bodies and extended into the fusopods. These bands of actin filaments were involved in cell fusion after approaching cells formed initial contacts. We conclude that the formation of fusopods is regulated by Rac1 to initiate intercellular contact during osteoclastogenesis. This step is followed by the tightly regulated assembly of bands of actin filaments in fusopods, which lead to closure of the intercellular gap and finally, cell fusion. These novel, actin-dependent processes are important for fusion processes in osteoclastogenesis.

Abstract: We previously identified peptide Lv, a novel bioactive peptide that enhances the activity of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs) in cone photoreceptors. In this study, we verified that peptide Lv was able to augment L-VGCC currents in cardiomyocytes, as well as promote proliferation of endothelial cells. We used a proteomics approach to determine the specific receptors and binding partners of peptide Lv and found that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) interacted with peptide Lv. Peptide Lv treatment in embryonic cardiomyocytes stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 and activated its downstream signaling. Peptide Lv activity was blocked by DMH4, a VEGFR2 specific blocker, but not by SCH202676, an allosteric inhibitor of G protein-coupled receptors, suggesting that the activity of peptide Lv was mediated through VEGFR2 signaling. Inhibition of VEGFR tyrosine kinase or its downstream signaling molecules abolished the augmentation of L-VGCCs elicited by peptide Lv in cardiomyocytes. In addition, peptide Lv promoted cell proliferation of cultured human endothelial cells. Calcium entry through L-VGCCs is essential for excitation–contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes. Since peptide Lv was able to augment L-VGCCs through activation of VEGF signaling in cardiomyocytes and promote proliferation of endothelial cells, peptide Lv may play an important role in regulating the cardiovascular system.

TRIB3 enhances cell viability during glucose deprivation in HEK293-derived cells by upregulating IGFBP2, a novel nutrient deficiency survival factor,

Abstract: Glucose deprivation occurs in several human diseases, including infarctions and solid tumors, and leads to cell death. In this article, we investigate the role of the pseudokinase Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) in the cellular stress response to glucose starvation using cell lines derived from HEK293, which is highly glycolytic under standard conditions. Our results show that TRIB3 mRNA and protein levels are strongly upregulated in glucose-deprived cells via the induction of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor kinase PERK. Cell survival in glucose-deficient conditions is enhanced by TRIB3 overexpression and reduced by TRIB3 knockdown. Genome-wide gene expression profiling uncovered approximately 40 glucose deprivation-responsive genes that are affected by TRIB3, including several genes involved in signaling processes and metabolism. Based on transcription factor motif analysis, the majority of TRIB3-downregulated genes are target genes of ATF4, which TRIB3 is known to inhibit. The gene most substantially upregulated by TRIB3 is insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2). IGFBP2 mRNA and protein levels are downregulated in cells subjected to glucose deprivation, and reduced IGFBP2 expression aggravates cell death during glucose deficiency, while overexpression of IGFBP2 prolongs cell survival. Moreover, IGFBP2 silencing abrogates the pro-survival effect of TRIB3. Since TRIB3 augments IGFBP2 expression in glucose-starved cells, the data indicate that IGFBP2 contributes to the attenuation of cell death by TRIB3. These results implicate TRIB3 and IGFBP2, both of which are known to be overexpressed in several types of cancers, as pro-survival modulators of cell viability in nutrient-deficient microenvironments.

Abstract: P-21-activated kinases (PAKs) are serine/threonine kinases comprising six isoforms divided in two groups, group-I (PAK1–3)/group-II (PAK4–6) which play important roles in cell cytoskeletal dynamics, survival, secretion and proliferation and are activated by diverse stimuli. However, little is known about PAKs ability to be activated by gastrointestinal (GI) hormones/neurotransmitters/growth-factors. We used rat pancreatic acini to explore the ability of GI-hormones/neurotransmitters/growth-factors to activate Group-I-PAKs and the signaling cascades involved. Only PAK2 was present in acini. PAK2 was activated by some pancreatic growth-factors [EGF, PDGF, bFGF], by secretagogues activating phospholipase-C (PLC) [CCK, carbachol, bombesin] and by post-receptor stimulants activating PKC [TPA], but not agents only mobilizing cellular calcium or increasing cyclic AMP. CCK-activation of PAK2 required both high- and low-affinity-CCK1-receptor-state activation. It was partially reduced by PKC- or Src-inhibition, but not with PI3K-inhibitors (wortmannin, LY294002) or thapsigargin. IPA-3, which prevents PAK2 binding to small-GTPases partially inhibited PAK2-activation, as well as reduced CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation and amylase release induced by CCK or bombesin. This study demonstrates pancreatic acini, possess only one Group-I-PAK, PAK2. CCK and other GI-hormones/neurotransmitters/growth-factors activate PAK2 via small GTPases (CDC42/Rac1), PKC and SFK but not cytosolic calcium or PI3K. CCK-activation of PAK2 showed several novel features being dependent on both receptor-activation states, having PLC- and PKC-dependent/independent components and small-GTPase-dependent/independent components. These results show that PAK2 is important in signaling cascades activated by numerous pancreatic stimuli which mediate their various physiological/pathophysiological responses and thus could be a promising target for the development of therapies in some pancreatic disorders such as pancreatitis.

Abstract: During mitosis and meiosis, kinetochore, a conserved multi-protein complex, connects microtubule with the centromere and promotes segregation of the chromosomes. In budding yeast, central kinetochore complex named Ctf19 has been implicated in various functions and is believed to be made up of three biochemically distinct subcomplexes: COMA, Ctf3 and Iml3–Chl4. In this study, we aimed to identify whether Ctf3 and COMA subcomplexes have any unshared function at the kinetochore. Our data suggests that both these subcomplexes may work as a single functional unit without any unique functions, which we tested. Analysis of severity of the defects in the mutants suggests that COMA is epistatic to Ctf3 subcomplex. Interestingly, we noticed that these subcomplexes affect the organization of mitotic and meiotic kinetochores with subtle differences and they promote maintenance of Cse4 at the centromeres specifically during meiosis which is similar to the role of Mis6 (Ctf3 homolog) in fission yeast during mitosis. Interestingly, analysis of ctf3Δ and ctf19Δ mutants revealed a novel role of Ctf19 complex in regulation of SPB cohesion and duplication in meiosis.

Abstract: The tight interrelationship between peroxisomes and mitochondria is illustrated by their cooperation in lipid metabolism, antiviral innate immunity and shared use of proteins executing organellar fission. In addition, we previously reported that disruption of peroxisome biogenesis in hepatocytes severely impacts on mitochondrial integrity, primarily damaging the inner membrane. Here we investigated the molecular impairments of the dysfunctional mitochondria in hepatocyte selective Pex5 knockout mice. First, by using blue native electrophoresis and in-gel activity stainings we showed that the respiratory complexes were differentially affected with reduction of complexes I and III and incomplete assembly of complex V, whereas complexes II and IV were normally active. This resulted in impaired oxygen consumption in cultured Pex5−/− hepatocytes. Second, mitochondrial DNA was depleted causing an imbalance in the expression of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits of the respiratory chain complexes. Third, mitochondrial membranes showed increased permeability and fluidity despite reduced content of the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid. Fourth, the affected mitochondria in peroxisome deficient hepatocytes displayed increased oxidative stress. Acute deletion of PEX5 in vivo using adeno-Cre virus phenocopied these effects, indicating that mitochondrial perturbations closely follow the loss of functional peroxisomes in time. Likely to compensate for the functional impairments, the volume of the mitochondrial compartment was increased several folds. This was not driven by PGC-1α but mediated by activation of PPARα, possibly through c-myc overexpression. In conclusion, loss of peroxisomal metabolism in hepatocytes perturbs the mitochondrial inner membrane, depletes mitochondrial DNA and causes mitochondrial biogenesis independent of PGC-1α.

Abstract: STIM1 is a key regulator of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), and therefore a mediator of Ca2+ entry-dependent cellular events. Phosphorylation of STIM1 at ERK1/2 target sites has been described as enhancing STIM1 activation during intracellular Ca2+ emptying triggered by the inhibition of the sarco(endo)plasmic Ca2+-ATPase with thapsigargin. However, no physiological function is known for this specific phosphorylation. The present study examined the role of STIM1 phosphorylation in cell signaling triggered by EGF. Using a human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line (Ishikawa cells) EGF or H-Ras(G12V), an active mutant of H-Ras, was found to trigger STIM1 phosphorylation at residues Ser575, Ser608, and Ser621, and this process was sensitive to PD0325901, an inhibitor of ERK1/2. Both, ERK1/2 activation and STIM1 phosphorylation took place in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, indicating that both events are upstream steps for Ca2+ entry activation. Also, EGF triggered the dissociation of STIM1 from EB1 (a regulator of microtubule plus-ends) in a manner similar to that reported for the activation of STIM1 by thapsigargin. Migration of the Ishikawa cells was impaired when STIM1 phosphorylation was targeted by Ser-to-Ala substitution mutation of ERK1/2 target sites. This effect was also observed with the Ca2+ channel blocker SKF96365. Phosphomimetic mutation of STIM1 restored the migration to levels similar to that found for STIM1-wild type. Finally, the increased vimentin expression and relocalization of E-cadherin triggered by EGF were largely inhibited by targeting STIM1 phosphorylation, while STIM1-S575E/S608E/S621E normalized the profiles of these two EMT markers.

Abstract: Dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) is a ubiquitously expressed member of the DPP4 gene and protease family. Deciphering the biological functions of DPP9 and its roles in pathogenesis has implicated DPP9 in tumor biology, the immune response, apoptosis, intracellular epidermal growth factor-dependent signaling and cell adhesion and migration. We investigated the intracellular distribution of DPP9 chimeric fluorescent proteins and consequent functions of DPP9. We showed that while some DPP9 is associated with mitochondria, the strongest co-localization was with microtubules. Under steady state conditions, DPP9 was not seen at the plasma membrane, but upon stimulation with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or epidermal growth factor, some DPP9 re-distributed towards the ruffling membrane. DPP9 was seen at the leading edge of the migrating cell and co-localized with the focal adhesion proteins, integrin-β1 and talin. DPP9 gene silencing and treatment with a DPP8/DPP9 specific inhibitor both reduced cell adhesion and migration. Expression of integrin-β1 and talin was decreased in DPP9-deficient and DPP9-enzyme-inactive cells. There was a concomitant decrease in the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, indicating that DPP9 knockdown or enzyme inhibition suppressed the associated adhesion signaling pathway, causing impaired cell movement. These novel findings provide mechanistic insights into the regulatory role of DPP9 in cell movement, and may thus implicate DPP9 in tissue and tumor growth and metastasis.

Disruption of polyubiquitin gene Ubc leads to attenuated resistance against arsenite-induced toxicity in mouse embryonic fibroblasts,

Abstract: The polyubiquitin gene Ubc is upregulated under oxidative stress induced by arsenite [As(III)]. However, the detailed mechanism of Ubc upregulation and the exact role of ubiquitin (Ub) to protect cells against As(III)-induced toxicity remain unknown. Here, we found that Ubc−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited reduced viability under As(III) exposure, although the Nrf2–Keap1 pathway was activated as a cytoprotective response. Intriguingly, due to the reduced polyubiquitination and delayed onset of degradation of Nrf2 in Ubc−/− MEFs, the basal expression levels of Nrf2 target genes were elevated. As(III)-induced accumulation of Ub conjugates occurred in an Nrf2-independent manner, probably due to cellular stress conditions, including reduced proteasomal activity. Increased cellular Ub levels were essential to polyubiquitinate misfolded proteins generated under As(III) exposure and to degrade them by the proteasome. However, when cellular Ub levels decreased, these misfolded proteins were not efficiently polyubiquitinated, but rather accumulated as large protein aggregates inside the cells, causing cytotoxicity. Furthermore, increased activity of the autophagic pathway to clear these aggregates was not observed in Ubc−/− MEFs. Therefore, reduced viability of Ubc−/− MEFs under As(III) exposure may not be due to dysregulation of the Nrf2–Keap1 pathway, but mostly to reduced efficacy to polyubiquitinate and degrade misfolded protein aggregates.

Abstract: Efficient phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) is essential to prevent the development of chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. Glucocorticoids are widely used in the therapy of chronic inflammatory diseases, and increasing evidence suggests that they act partly via enhancing efferocytosis by macrophages. Glucocorticoids were previously shown to promote both protein S- and MFG-E8-dependent efferocytosis. Since previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that glucocorticoids induce the expression of retinaldehyde dehydrogenases in macrophages, in the present experiments the possible involvement of retinoids in the glucocorticoid-induced efferocytosis was studied in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages. Here we show that glucocorticoids promote not only short-term, but also long-term clearance of apoptotic cells. Glucocorticoids seem to directly induce the expression of the phagocytosis-related genes MERTK, C1q, UCP2, and the transcription factor C/EBPβ. C/EBPβ contributes to the further induction of the phagocytosis-related genes, and is required for the induction of lipid sensing receptors LXRs, PPARδ, RARα, RXRα and RALDH1, the latter one in an LXR- and RARα-dependent manner. Glucocorticoid-induced enhancement in long-term efferocytosis was dependent on the induction of lipid sensing receptors known to be triggered by the lipid content of the engulfed cells to enhance phagocytic capacity. Retinoids did not affect the glucocorticoid-induced short term phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, but were required for the glucocorticoid-induced enhancement of efferocytosis during prolonged clearance of apoptotic cells by promoting efficient LXR and PPARδ upregulation. Our data indicate that retinoids could be considered as potential promoters of the efficacy of glucocorticoid treatment in inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the mature cytochrome bc1 complex exists as an obligate homo-dimer in which each monomer consists of ten distinct protein subunits inserted into or bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Among them, the Rieske iron–sulfur protein (Rip1), besides its catalytic role in electron transfer, may be implicated in the bc1 complex dimerization. Indeed, Rip1 has the globular domain containing the catalytic center in one monomer while the transmembrane helix interacts with the adjacent monomer. In addition, the lack of Rip1 leads to the accumulation of an immature bc1 intermediate, only loosely associated with cytochrome c oxidase. In this study we have investigated the biogenesis of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex using epitope tagged proteins to purify native assembly intermediates. We showed that the dimerization process is an early event during bc1 complex biogenesis and that the presence of Rip1, differently from previous proposals, is not essential for this process. We also investigated the multi-step model of bc1 assembly thereby lending further support to the existence of bona fide subcomplexes during bc1 maturation in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Finally, a new model of cytochrome bc1 complex assembly, in which distinct intermediates sequentially interact during bc1 maturation, has been proposed.

Abstract: The metabolism of proliferating cells shows common features even in evolutionary distant organisms such as mammals and yeasts, for example the requirement for anabolic processes under tight control of signaling pathways. Analysis of the rewiring of metabolism, which occurs following the dysregulation of signaling pathways, provides new knowledge about the mechanisms underlying cell proliferation. The key energy regulator in yeast Snf1 and its mammalian ortholog AMPK have earlier been shown to have similar functions at glucose limited conditions and here we show that they also have analogies when grown with glucose excess. We show that loss of Snf1 in cells growing in 2% glucose induces an extensive transcriptional reprogramming, enhances glycolytic activity, fatty acid accumulation and reliance on amino acid utilization for growth. Strikingly, we demonstrate that Snf1/AMPK-deficient cells remodel their metabolism fueling mitochondria and show glucose and amino acids addiction, a typical hallmark of cancer cells.

Abstract: Macroautophagy (autophagy) is an important factor affecting the function of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and must be tightly regulated in these cells. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this process, particularly in the presence of serum, remain obscure. In this study, we identified trans-3,5,4′-trimethoxystilbene (TMS) as a potent small molecule inducer of autophagy in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) in the presence of serum. Using high-throughput DNA microarray and siRNA transfection technologies, we demonstrated that TMS induced autophagy by up-regulating the expression of the transient receptor potential canonical channel 4 (TRPC4), an important cation channel in HUVECs. In addition, the overexpression of TRPC4 by plasmid transfection also induced autophagy. Mechanistic studies revealed that the up-regulation of TRPC4 increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which, in turn, activated the Ca2+/CaMKKβ/AMPK pathway, leading to mTOR inhibition and autophagy. Our study identifies a novel role for TRPC4 in the regulation of autophagy in VECs. TMS is a useful new tool for investigating the molecular mechanism of autophagy in VECs and may serve as a potential lead compound for developing a class of autophagy inducers to treat autophagy-related diseases.

Abstract: Annexin-A5 (AnxA5) is the smallest member of the annexins, a group of soluble proteins that bind to membranes containing negatively-charged phospholipids, principally phosphatidylserine, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. AnxA5 presents unique properties of binding and self-assembling on membrane surfaces, forming highly ordered two-dimensional (2D) arrays. We showed previously that AnxA5 plays a central role in the machinery of cell membrane repair of murine perivascular cells, promoting the resealing of membrane damages via the formation of 2D protein arrays at membrane disrupted sites and preventing the extension of membrane ruptures. As the placenta is one of the richest source of AnxA5 in humans, we investigated whether AnxA5 was involved in membrane repair in this organ. We addressed this question at the level of human trophoblasts, either mononucleated cytotrophoblasts or multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts, in choriocarcinoma cells and primary trophoblasts. Using established procedure of laser irradiation and fluorescence microscopy, we observed that both human cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts repair efficiently a μm2-size disruption. Compared to wild-type cells, AnxA5-deficient trophoblasts exhibit severe defect of membrane repair. Through specifically binding to the disrupted site as early as a few seconds after membrane wounding, AnxA5 promotes membrane resealing of injured human trophoblasts. In addition, we observed that a large membrane area containing the disrupted site was released in the extracellular milieu. We propose mechanisms ensuring membrane resealing and subsequent lesion removal in human trophoblasts. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 13th European Symposium on Calcium.

Characterization of the interactions between SAP97 and an NMDA receptor splice variant, GluN1-3, and of the effects on forward trafficking revealed that an ER-level interaction blocked the RXR ER-retention motif in the GluN1-3 cytoplasmic C-terminus in the context of both reporter molecules and full-length receptors. Binding of SAP97 to the PDZ-binding domain of GluN1-3 was required, but the blockade of ER-retention was mediated by the SH3–GuK domains coupled with the action of the N-terminus of SAP97. While other domains of SAP97 were involved in forward trafficking of GluN1-3 out of the ER, the SH3 domain was necessary and sufficient to block the ER retention. This is the first direct evidence for the masking of ER-retention signals by PDZ domain-containing proteins, and provides detailed underlying mechanistic requirements. Such a mechanism could be central to modulating the ER exit of receptors into local, non-conventional or conventional, secretory pathways in neurons.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the actin binding protein, ezrin, and the cAMP-sensor, EPAC1, cooperate to induce cell spreading in response to elevations in intracellular cAMP. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects we generated a model of EPAC1-dependent cell spreading based on the stable transfection of EPAC1 into HEK293T (HEK293T–EPAC1) cells. We found that direct activation of EPAC1 with the EPAC-selective analogue, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (007), promoted cell spreading in these cells. In addition, co-activation of EPAC1 and PKA, with a combination of the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, and the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, rolipram, was found to synergistically enhance cell spreading, in association with cortical actin bundling and mobilisation of ezrin to the plasma membrane. PKA activation was also associated with phosphorylation of ezrin on Thr567, as detected by an electrophoretic band mobility shift during SDS-PAGE. Inhibition of PKA activity blocked ezrin phosphorylation and reduced the cell spreading response to cAMP elevation to levels induced by EPAC1-activation alone. Transfection of HEK293T–EPAC1 cells with inhibitory ezrin mutants lacking the key PKA phosphorylation site, ezrin-Thr567Ala, or the ability to associate with actin, ezrin-Arg579Ala, promoted cell arborisation and blocked the ability of EPAC1 and PKA to further promote cell spreading. The PKA phospho-mimetic mutants of ezrin, ezrin-Thr567Asp had no effect on EPAC1-driven cell spreading. Our results indicate that association of ezrin with the actin cytoskeleton and phosphorylation on Thr567 are required, but not sufficient, for PKA and EPAC1 to synergistically promote cell spreading following elevations in intracellular cAMP.

Onconase induces autophagy sensitizing pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine and activates Akt/mTOR pathway in a ROS-dependent manner,

Abstract: Onconase® (ONC) is a member of the RNase super-family that is secreted in oocytes and early embryos of Rana pipiens. Over the last years, research interest about this small and basic frog RNase, also called ranpirnase, constantly increased because of its high cytotoxicity and anticancer properties. Onconase is currently used in clinical trials for cancer therapy; however, the precise mechanisms determining cytotoxicity in cancer cells have not yet been fully investigated. In the present manuscript, we evaluate the antitumoral property of onconase in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and in non-tumorigenic cells as a control. We demonstrate that ONC stimulates a strong antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect in cancer cells by reporting for the first time that ONC triggers Beclin1-mediated autophagic cancer cell death. In addition, ONC inhibits the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) triggering mitochondrial superoxide ion production. ONC-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) are responsible for Akt/mTOR pathway stimulation determining the sensitivity of cancer cells to mTOR inhibitors and lessening autophagic stimulation. This indicates ROS/Akt/mTOR axis as a strategy adopted by cancer cells to reduce ONC-mediated cytotoxic autophagy stimulation. In addition, we demonstrate that ONC can sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to the standard chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine allowing a reduction of drug concentration when used in combination settings, thus suggesting a lowering of chemotherapy-related side effects. Altogether, our results shed more light on the mechanisms lying at the basis of ONC antiproliferative effect in cancer cells and support its potential use to develop new anticancer strategies.

Abstract: Fatty acids affect insulin secretion via metabolism and FFAR1-mediated signaling. Recent reports indicate that these two pathways act synergistically. Still it remains unclear how they interrelate. Taking into account the key role of mitochondria in insulin secretion, we attempted to dissect the metabolic and FFAR1-mediated effects of fatty acids on mitochondrial function. One-hour culture of MIN6 cells with palmitate significantly enhanced mitochondrial respiration. Antagonism or silencing of FFAR1 prevented the palmitate-induced rise in respiration. On the other hand, in the absence of extracellular palmitate FFAR1 agonists caused a modest increase in respiration. Using an agonist of the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and PKC inhibitor we found that in the presence of the fatty acid mitochondrial respiration is regulated via Gαq protein-coupled receptor signaling. The increase in respiration in palmitate-treated cells was largely due to increased glucose utilization and oxidation. However, glucose utilization was not dependent on FFAR1 signaling. Collectively, these results indicate that mitochondrial respiration in palmitate-treated cells is enhanced via combined action of intracellular metabolism of the fatty acid and the Gαq-coupled FFAR1 signaling. Long-term palmitate exposure reduced ATP-coupling efficiency of mitochondria and deteriorated insulin secretion. The presence of the FFAR1 antagonist during culture did not improve ATP-coupling efficiency, however, it resulted in enhanced mitochondrial respiration and improved insulin secretion after culture. Taken together, our study demonstrates that during palmitate exposure, integrated actions of fatty acid metabolism and fatty acid-induced FFAR1 signaling on mitochondrial respiration underlie the synergistic action of the two pathways on insulin secretion.

Abstract: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) disease is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene (CF transmembrane conductance regulator). F508 deletion is the most represented mutation, and F508del-CFTR is absent of plasma membrane and accumulates into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment. Using specific Ca2+ genetics cameleon probes, we showed in the human bronchial CF epithelial cell line CFBE that ER Ca2+ concentration was strongly increased compared to non-CF (16HBE) cells, and normalized by the F508del-CFTR corrector agent, VX-809. We also showed that ER F508del-CFTR retention increases SERCA (Sarcoplasmic/Reticulum Ca2+ ATPase) pump activity whereas PMCA (Plasma Membrane Ca2+ ATPase) activities were reduced in these CF cells compared to corrected CF cells (VX-809) and non-CF cells. We are showing for the first time CFTR/SERCA and CFTR/PMCA interactions that are modulated in CF cells and could explain part of Ca2+ homeostasis deregulation due to mislocalization of F508del-CFTR. Using ER or mitochondria genetics Ca2+ probes, we are showing that ER Ca2+ content, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, SERCA and PMCA pump, activities are strongly affected by the localization of F508del-CFTR protein.

Abstract: Steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) is a coactivator that regulates nuclear receptor activity. We previously reported that SRC-2 protein is degraded through the action of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). In the study presented here, we aimed to identify proteins that interact with and thereby regulate SRC-2. We isolated cyclin C (CCNC) as an interacting partner with the SRC-2 degradation domain aa 347-758 in a yeast two-hybrid assay and confirmed direct interaction in an in vitro assay. The protein level of SRC-2 was increased with CCNC overexpression in COS-1 cells and decreased with CCNC silencing in COS-1 and MCF-7 cells. In a pulse-chase assay, we further show that silencing of CCNC resulted in a different SRC-2 degradation pattern during the first 6h after the pulse. Finally, we provide evidence that CCNC regulates expression of cell cycle genes upregulated by SRC-2. In conclusion, our results suggest that CCNC temporarily protects SRC-2 against degradation and this event is involved in the transcriptional regulation of SRC-2 cell cycle target genes.

Abstract: Cancer remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although progress has been made regarding chemotherapeutic agents, new therapies that combine increased selectivity and efficacy with low resistance are still needed. In the search for new anticancer agents, therapies based on biologically active peptides, in particular, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), have attracted attention for their decreased resistance development and low cytotoxicity. Many AMPs have proved to be tumoricidal agents against human cancer cells, but their mode of action is still controversial. The existence of common properties shared by the membranes of bacteria and tumor cells points to similar lipid-targeting mechanisms in both cases. On the other hand, anticancer peptides (ACPs) also induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis. Human neutrophil peptide-1 (HNP-1) is an endogenous AMP that has been implicated in different cellular phenomena such as tumor proliferation. The presence of HNP-1 in the serum/plasma of oncologic patients turns this peptide into a potential tumor biomarker. The present work reveals the different effects of HNP-1 on the biophysical and nanomechanical properties of solid and hematological tumor cells. Studies on cellular morphology, cellular stiffness, and membrane ultrastructure and charge using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and zeta potential measurements show a preferential binding of HNP-1 to solid tumor cells from human prostate adenocarcinoma when compared to human leukemia cells. AFM also reveals induction of apoptosis with cellular membrane defects at very low peptide concentrations. Understanding ACPs mode(s) of action will certainly open innovative pathways for drug development in cancer treatment.

Abstract: Orai1 subunits interacting with STIM1 molecules comprise the major components responsible for calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. The homologs Orai2 and Orai3 yield smaller store-operated currents when overexpressed and are mostly unable to substitute Orai1. Orai3 subunits are also essential components of store independent channel complexes and also tune inhibition of ICRAC by reactive oxygen species. Here we use patch-clamp, microscopy, Ca2+-imaging and biochemical experiments to investigate the interdependence of Orai2, Orai3 and Orai1. We demonstrate that store-operation and localization of Orai3 but not of Orai2 to STIM1 clusters in HEK cells or to the immunological synapse in T cells is facilitated by Orai1 while Orai3's store-independent activity remains unaffected. On the other hand, one Orai3 subunit confers redox-resistance to heteromeric channels. The inefficient store operation of Orai3 is partly due to the lack of three critical C-terminal residues, the insertion of which improves interaction with STIM1 and abrogates Orai3's dependence on Orai1. Our results suggest that Orai3 down-tunes efficient STIM1 gating when in a heteromeric complex with Orai1.

Abstract: Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is a poor prognostic factor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), however its functional roles and molecular mechanisms of action remain to be clarified. Here, we described the functions and signaling pathways for LCN2 in ESCC. Overexpression of LCN2 in ESCC cells accelerated cell migration and invasion in vitro, and promoted lung metastasis in vivo. Blocking LCN2 expression inhibited its pro-oncogenic effect. Either overexpression of LCN2 or treatment with recombinant human LCN2 protein enhanced the activation of MEK/ERK pathway, which in turn increases endogenous LCN2 to increase MMP-9 activity. The decreased p-cofilin and increased p-ERM induced by pERK1/2 cause the cytoskeleton F-actin rearrangement and alter the behavior of ESCC cells mediated by LCN2. As a consequence, activation of MMP-9 and the rearrangement of F-actin throw light on the mechanisms for LCN2 in ESCC. These results imply that LCN2 promotes the migration and invasion of ESCC cells through a novel positive feedback loop.

Abstract: Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) is an adipose tissue-secreted adipokine that is involved in the regulation of energetic metabolism and inflammation. Increased levels of circulating FABP4 have been detected in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors. Recent studies have demonstrated that FABP4 has a direct effect on peripheral tissues, specifically promoting vascular dysfunction; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. The objective of this work was to assess the specific interactions between exogenous FABP4 and the plasma membranes of endothelial cells. Immunofluorescence assays showed that exogenous FABP4 localized along the plasma membranes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), interacting specifically with plasma membrane proteins. Anti-FABP4 immunoblotting revealed two covalent protein complexes containing FABP4 and its putative receptor; these complexes were approximately 108kDa and 77kDa in size. Proteomics and mass spectrometry experiments revealed that cytokeratin 1 (CK1) was the FABP4-binding protein. An anti-CK1 immunoblot confirmed the presence of CK1. FABP4-CK1 complexes were also detected in HAECs, HCASMCs, HepG2 cells and THP-1 cells. Pharmacological FABP4 inhibition by BMS309403 results in a slight decrease in the formation of these complexes, indicating that fatty acids may play a role in FABP4 functionality. In addition, we demonstrated that exogenous FABP4 crosses the plasma membrane to enter the cytoplasm and nucleus in HUVECs. These findings indicate that exogenous FABP4 interacts with plasma membrane proteins, specifically CK1. These data contribute to our current knowledge regarding the mechanism of action of circulating FABP4.

Abstract: Cell invasion and adhesion play an important role in cancer metastasis and are orchestrated by a complicated network of transcription factors including p63. Here, we show that a member of the tripartite motif protein family, TRIM29, is required for regulation of the p63-mediated pathway in cervical cancer cells. TRIM29 knockdown alters the adhesion and invasion activities of cervical cancer cells. TRIM29 knockdown and overexpression cause a significant decrease and increase of TAp63α expression, respectively. TRIM29 knockdown alters the expression pattern of integrins and increases ZEB1 expression. TRIM29 is required for suppression of an increase in the adhesion activity of cells by TAp63α. These findings suggest that TRIM29 regulates the p63-mediated pathway and the behavior of cervical cancer cells.

Abstract: Stable overexpression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS-3) in HepG2 cells (4TO-NOS) leads to increased nitro-oxidative stress and upregulation of the cell death mediators p53 and Fas. Thus, NOS-3 overexpression has been suggested as a useful antiproliferative mechanism in hepatocarcinoma cells. We aimed to identify the underlying mechanism of cell death induced by NOS-3 overexpression at basal conditions and with anti-Fas treatment. The intracellular localization of NOS-3, the nitro-oxidative stress and the mitochondrial activity were analysed. In addition, the protein expression profile in 4TO-NOS was screened for differentially expressed proteins potentially involved in the induction of apoptosis. NOS-3 localization in the mitochondrial outer membrane was not associated with changes in the respiratory cellular capacity, but was related to the mitochondrial biogenesis increase and with a higher protein expression of mitochondrial complex IV. Nitro-oxidative stress and cell death in NOS-3 overexpressing cells occurred with the expression increase of pro-apoptotic genes and a higher expression/activity of the enzymes adrenodoxin reductase mitochondrial (AR) and cathepsin D (CatD). CatD overexpression in 4TO-NOS was related to the apoptosis induction independently of its catalytic activity. In addition, CatD activity inhibition by pepstatin A was not effective in blocking apoptosis induced by anti-Fas. In summary, NOS-3 overexpression resulted in an increased sensitivity to anti-Fas induced cell death, independently of AR expression and CatD activity.

Abstract: DLC1 is a RhoGAP-containing tumor suppressor and many of DLC1's functions are absolutely dependent on its RhoGAP activity. Through its RhoGAP domain, DLC1 inhibits the activity of RhoA GTPase, which regulates actin cytoskeleton networks and dis/assembly of focal adhesions. Tensin1 (TNS1) is a focal adhesion molecule that links the actin cytoskeleton to integrins and forms signaling complexes through its multiple binding domains. Here, we report that TNS1 enhances RhoA activity in a DLC1-dependent manner. This is accomplished by binding to DLC1 through TNS1's C2, SH2, and PTB domains. Point mutations at these three sites disrupt TNS1's interaction with DLC1 as well as its effect on RhoA activity. The biological relevance of this TNS1–DLC1–RhoA signaling axis is investigated in TNS1 knockout (KO) cells and mice. Endothelial cells isolated from TNS1 KO mice or those silenced with TNS1 siRNA show significant reduction in proliferation, migration, and tube formation activities. Concomitantly, the RhoA activity is down-regulated in TNS1 KO cells and this reduction is restored by further silencing of DLC1. Furthermore, the angiogenic process is compromised in TNS1 KO mice. These studies demonstrate that TNS1 binds to DLC1 and fine-tunes its RhoGAP activity toward RhoA and that the TNS1–DLC1–RhoA signaling axis is critical in regulating cellular functions that lead to angiogenesis.

Abstract: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseβ (PI3Kβ) plays a predominant role in integrin outside-in signaling and in platelet activation by GPVI engagement. We have shown that the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 mediates PI3Kβ activation downstream of integrin αIIbβ3, and promotes the phosphorylation of the PI3K-associated adaptor protein c-Cbl. In this study, we compared the functional correlation between Pyk2 and PI3Kβ upon recruitment of the two main platelet collagen receptors, integrin α2β1 and GPVI. PI3Kβ-mediated phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited in Pyk2-deficient platelets adherent to monomeric collagen through integrin α2β1, but occurred normally upon GPVI ligation. Integrin α2β1 engagement led to Pyk2-independent association of c-Cbl with PI3K. However, c-Cbl was not phosphorylated in adherent platelets, and phosphorylation of Akt occurred normally in c-Cbl-deficient platelets, indicating that the c-Cbl is dispensable for Pyk2-mediated PI3Kβ activation. Stimulation of platelets with CRP, a selective GPVI ligand, induced c-Cbl phosphorylation in the absence of Pyk2, but failed to promote its association with PI3K. Pyk2 activation was completely abrogated in PI3KβKD, but not in PI3KγKD platelets, and was strongly inhibited by Src kinases and phospholipase C inhibitors, and by BAPTA-AM. The absence of PI3Kβ activity also hampered GPVI-induced tyrosine–phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ2, preventing intracellular Ca2+ increase and phosphorylation of pleckstrin. Moreover, GPVI-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase and pleckstrin phosphorylation were also strongly inhibited in human platelets treated with the PI3Kβ inhibitor TGX-221. These results outline important differences in the regulation of PI3Kβ by GPVI and integrin α2β1 and suggest that inhibition of Pyk2 may target PI3Kβ activation in a selective context of platelet stimulation.

Abstract: The lipid droplet (LD) is a cellular organelle that stores neutral lipids in cells and has been linked with metabolic disorders. Caenorhabditis elegans has many characteristics which make it an excellent animal model for studying LDs. However, unlike in mammalian cells, no LD structure-like/resident proteins have been identified in C. elegans, which has limited the utility of this model for the study of lipid storage and metabolism. Herein based on three lines of evidence, we identified that MDT-28 and DHS-3 previously identified in C. elegans LD proteome were two LD structure-like/resident proteins. First, MDT-28 and DHS-3 were found to be the two most abundant LD proteins in the worm. Second, the proteins were specifically localized to LDs and we identified the domains responsible for this targeting in both proteins. Third and most importantly, the depletion of MDT-28 induced LD clustering while DHS-3 deletion reduced triacylglycerol content (TAG). We further characterized the proteins finding that MDT-28 was ubiquitously expressed in the intestine, muscle, hypodermis, and embryos, whereas DHS-3 was expressed mainly in intestinal cells. Together, these two LD structure-like/resident proteins provide a basis for future mechanistic studies into the dynamics and functions of LDs in C. elegans.

Abstract: The importance of the oncogene Ras in cardiac hypertrophy is well appreciated. The hypertrophic effects of the constitutively active mutant Ras-Val12 are revealed by clinical syndromes due to the Ras mutations and experimental studies. We examined the possible anti-hypertrophic effect of Ras inhibition in vitro using rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (NRCM) and in vivo in the setting of pressure-overload left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (POH) in rats. Ras functions were modulated via adenovirus directed gene transfer of active mutant Ras-Val12 or dominant negative mutant N17-DN-Ras (DN-Ras). Ras-Val12 expression in vitro activates NFAT resulting in pro-hypertrophic and cardio-toxic effects on NRCM beating and Z-line organization. In contrast, the DN-Ras was antihypertrophic on NRCM, inhibited NFAT and exerted cardio-protective effects attested by preserved NRCM beating and Z line structure. Additional experiments with silencing H-Ras gene strategy corroborated the antihypertrophic effects of siRNA-H-Ras on NRCM. In vivo, with the POH model, both Ras mutants were associated with similar hypertrophy two weeks after simultaneous induction of POH and Ras-mutant gene transfer. However, LV diameters were higher and LV fractional shortening lower in the Ras-Val12 group compared to control and DN-Ras. Moreover, DN-Ras reduced the cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes in vivo, and decreased the expression of markers of pathologic cardiac hypertrophy. In isolated adult cardiomyocytes after 2weeks of POH and Ras-mutant gene transfer, DN-Ras improved sarcomere shortening and calcium transients compared to Ras-Val12. Overall, DN-Ras promotes a more physiological form of hypertrophy, suggesting an interesting therapeutic target for pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

Abstract: The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum possesses sophisticated systems of protein secretion to modulate host cell invasion and remodeling. In the present study, we provide insights into the function of the AP-1 complex in P. falciparum. We utilized GFP fusion constructs for live cell imaging, as well as fixed parasites in immunofluorescence analysis, to study adaptor protein mu1 (Pfμ1) mediated protein trafficking in P. falciparum. In trophozoites Pfμ1 showed similar dynamic localization to that of several Golgi/ER markers, indicating Golgi/ER localization. Treatment of transgenic parasites with Brefeldin A altered the localization of Golgi-associated Pfμ1, supporting the localization studies. Co-localization studies showed considerable overlap of Pfμ1 with the resident rhoptry proteins, rhoptry associated protein 1 (RAP1) and Cytoadherence linked asexual gene 3.1 (Clag3.1) in schizont stage. Immunoprecipitation experiments with Pfμ1 and PfRAP1 revealed an interaction, which may be mediated through an intermediate transmembrane cargo receptor. A specific role for Pfμ1 in trafficking was suggested by treatment with AlF4, which resulted in a shift to a predominantly ER-associated compartment and consequent decrease in co-localization with the Golgi marker GRASP. Together, these results suggest a role for the AP-1 complex in rhoptry protein trafficking in P. falciparum.

Abstract: IL-34 is a challenging cytokine sharing functional similarities with M-CSF through M-CSFR activation. It also plays a singular role that has recently been explained in the brain, through a binding to the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase RPTPβ/ζ. The aim of this paper was to look for alternative binding of IL-34 on other cell types. Myeloid cells (HL-60, U-937, THP-1) were used as cells intrinsically expressing M-CSFR, and M-CSFR was expressed in TF-1 and HEK293 cells. IL-34 binding was studied by Scatchard and binding inhibition assays, using 125I-radiolabelled cytokines, and surface plasmon resonance. M-CSFR activation was analysed by Western blot after glycosaminoglycans abrasion, syndecan-1 overexpression or repression and addition of a blocking anti-syndecan antibody. M-CSF and IL-34 induced different patterns of M-CSFR phosphorylations, suggesting the existence of alternative binding for IL-34. Binding experiments and chondroitinase treatment confirmed low affinity binding to chondroitin sulphate chains on cells lacking both M-CSFR and RPTPβ/ζ. Amongst the proteoglycans with chondroitin sulphate chains, syndecan-1 was able to modulate the IL-34-induced M-CSFR signalling pathways. Interestingly, IL-34 induced the migration of syndecan-1 expressing cells. Indeed, IL-34 significantly increased the migration of THP-1 and M2a macrophages that was inhibited by addition of a blocking anti-syndecan-1 antibody. This paper provides evidence of alternative binding of IL-34 to chondroitin sulphates and syndecan-1 at the cell surface that modulates M-CSFR activation. In addition, IL-34-induced myeloid cell migration is a syndecan-1 dependent mechanism.

Abstract: Brief changes in the cytosolic and intra-organellar Ca2+ concentration serve as specific signals for various physiological processes. In mesothelial cells lining the surface of internal organs and the walls of body cavities, a re-entry in the cell cycle (G0–G1 transition) evoked by serum re-administration induces long-lasting Ca2+ oscillations with a slowly decreasing frequency. Individual mesothelial cells show a wide range of different oscillatory patterns within a single, supposedly homogenous cell population. Changes in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (ccyt) show baseline oscillatory patterns i.e., discrete Ca2+ transients starting from a constant basal ccyt level. The ER Ca2+ concentration (cER) displays a sawtooth wave at a semi-depleted ER state; the minimum level is reached just briefly after the maximal value for ccyt. These oscillations depend on plasmalemmal Ca2+ influx and on the inositol trisphosphate concentration [InsP3]; the Ca2+ influx is a crucial determinant of the oscillation frequency. Partial blocking of SERCA pumps modifies the oscillation frequency in both directions, i.e. increasing it in some cells and lowering it in others. Current mathematical models for Ca2+ oscillations mostly fail to reproduce two experimentally observed phenomena: the broad range of interspike intervals and constant basal ccyt levels between two Ca2+ spikes. Here we developed a new model based on – and fitted to – Ca2+ recordings of ccyt and cER recorded in primary mouse mesothelial cells. The model allowed for explaining many features of experimentally observed Ca2+ oscillations. We consider this model to be suitable to simulate various types of InsP3 receptor-based baseline Ca2+ oscillations.

Abstract: Inflammasomes play a critical role in the development of vascular diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms activating the inflammasome in endothelial cells and the relevance of this inflammasome activation is far from clear. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which an Nlrp3 inflammasome is activated to result in endothelial dysfunction during coronary arteritis by Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) cell wall fragments (LCWE) in a mouse model for Kawasaki disease. Endothelial dysfunction associated with increased vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) expression and endothelial–leukocyte adhesion was observed during coronary arteritis in mice treated with LCWE. Accompanied with these changes, the inflammasome activation was also shown in coronary arterial endothelium, which was characterized by a marked increase in caspase-1 activity and IL-1β production. In cultured endothelial cells, LCWE induced Nlrp3 inflammasome formation, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production, which were blocked by Nlrp3 gene silencing or lysosome membrane stabilizing agents such as colchicine, dexamethasone, and ceramide. However, a potassium channel blocker glibenclamide or an oxygen free radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine had no effects on LCWE-induced inflammasome activation. LCWE also increased endothelial cell lysosomal membrane permeability and triggered lysosomal cathepsin B release into cytosol. Silencing cathepsin B blocked LCWE-induced Nlrp3 inflammasome formation and activation in endothelial cells. In vivo, treatment of mice with cathepsin B inhibitor also abolished LCWE-induced inflammasome activation in coronary arterial endothelium. It is concluded that LCWE enhanced lysosomal membrane permeabilization and consequent release of lysosomal cathepsin B, resulting in activation of the endothelial Nlrp3 inflammasome, which may contribute to the development of coronary arteritis.

Abstract: Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles which participate in a variety of essential biochemical pathways. An intimate interrelationship between peroxisomes and mitochondria is emerging in mammals, where both organelles cooperate in fatty acid β-oxidation and cellular lipid homeostasis. As mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation is lacking in yeast and plants, suitable genetically accessible model systems to study this interrelationship are scarce. Here, we propose the filamentous fungus Ustilago maydis as a suitable model for those studies. We combined molecular cell biology, bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses and provide the first comprehensive inventory of U. maydis peroxisomal proteins and pathways. Studies with a peroxisome-deficient Δpex3 mutant revealed the existence of parallel and complex, cooperative β-oxidation pathways in peroxisomes and mitochondria, mimicking the situation in mammals. Furthermore, we provide evidence that acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) are bona fide peroxisomal proteins in fungi and mammals and together with acyl-CoA oxidases (ACOX) belong to the basic enzymatic repertoire of peroxisomes. A genome comparison with baker's yeast and human gained new insights into the basic peroxisomal protein inventory shared by humans and fungi and revealed novel peroxisomal proteins and functions in U. maydis. The importance of our findings for the evolution and function of the complex interrelationship between peroxisomes and mitochondria in fatty acid β-oxidation is discussed.

Abstract: Small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily play diverse roles in intracellular trafficking. Among them, the Rab, Arf, and Rho families function in successive steps of vesicle transport, in forming vesicles from donor membranes, directing vesicle trafficking toward target membranes and docking vesicles onto target membranes. These proteins act as molecular switches that are controlled by a cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). In this study we explored the role of GAPs in the regulation of the endocytic pathway using fluorescently labeled yeast mating pheromone α-factor. Among 25 non-essential GAP mutants, we found that deletion of the GLO3 gene, encoding Arf-GAP protein, caused defective internalization of fluorescently labeled α-factor. Quantitative analysis revealed that glo3Δ cells show defective α-factor binding to the cell surface. Interestingly, Ste2p, the α-factor receptor, was mis-localized from the plasma membrane to the vacuole in glo3Δ cells. Domain deletion mutants of Glo3p revealed that a GAP-independent function, as well as the GAP activity, of Glo3p is important for both α-factor binding and Ste2p localization at the cell surface. Additionally, we found that deletion of the GLO3 gene affects the size and number of Arf1p-residing Golgi compartments and causes a defect in transport from the TGN to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we demonstrated that glo3Δ cells were defective in the late endosome-to-TGN transport pathway, but not in the early endosome-to-TGN transport pathway. These findings suggest novel roles for Arf-GAP Glo3p in endocytic recycling of cell surface proteins.

Abstract: P21-activated kinases (PAKs) are multifunctional effectors of Rho GTPases with both kinase and scaffolding activity. Here, we investigated the effects of inflammation on PAK1 signaling and its role in colitis-driven carcinogenesis. PAK1 and p-PAK1 (Thr423) were assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. C57BL6/J wildtype mice were treated with a single intraperitoneal TNFα injection. Small intestinal organoids from these mice and from PAK1-KO mice were cultured with TNFα. NF-κB and PPARγ were analyzed upon PAK1 overexpression and silencing for transcriptional/translational regulation. PAK1 expression and activation was increased on the luminal intestinal epithelial surface in inflammatory bowel disease and colitis-associated cancer. PAK1 was phosphorylated upon treatment with IFNγ, IL-1β, and TNFα. In vivo, mice administered with TNFα showed increased p-PAK1 in intestinal villi, which was associated with nuclear p65 and NF-κB activation. p65 nuclear translocation downstream of TNFα was strongly inhibited in PAK1-KO small intestinal organoids. PAK1 overexpression induced a PAK1–p65 interaction as visualized by co-immunoprecipitation, nuclear translocation, and increased NF-κB transactivation, all of which were impeded by kinase-dead PAK1. Moreover, PAK1 overexpression downregulated PPARγ and mesalamine recovered PPARγ through PAK1 inhibition. On the other hand PAK1 silencing inhibited NF-κB, which was recovered using BADGE, a PPARγ antagonist. Altogether these data demonstrate that PAK1 overexpression and activation in inflammation and colitis-associated cancer promote NF-κB activity via suppression of PPARγ in intestinal epithelial cells.

Abstract: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) maintains animal body temperature by non-shivering thermogenesis, which is through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and utilizes β-oxidation of fatty acids released from triacylglycerol (TAG) in lipid droplets (LDs). Increasing BAT activity and “browning” other tissues such as white adipose tissue (WAT) can enhance the expenditure of excess stored energy, and in turn reduce prevalence of metabolic diseases. Although many studies have characterized the biology of BAT and brown adipocytes, BAT LDs especially their activation induced by cold exposure remain to be explored. We have isolated LDs from mouse interscapular BAT and characterized the full proteome using mass spectrometry. Both morphological and biochemical experiments showed that the LDs could tightly associate with mitochondria. Under cold treatment mouse BAT started expressing LD structure protein PLIN-2/ADRP and increased expression of PLIN1. Both hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipose TAG lipase (ATGL) were increased in LDs. In addition, isolated BAT LDs showed increased levels of the mitochondrial protein UCP1, and prolonged cold exposure could stimulate BAT mitochondrial cristae biogenesis. These changes were in agreement with the data from transcriptional analysis. Our results provide the BAT LD proteome for the first time and show that BAT LDs facilitate heat production by coupling increasing TAG hydrolysis through recruitment of ATGL and HSL to the organelle and expression of another LD resident protein PLIN2/ADRP, as well as by tightly associating with activated mitochondria. These findings will benefit the study of BAT activation and the interaction between LDs and mitochondria.

Abstract: STIM1 is a ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor of the intracellular, agonist-sensitive, Ca2+ stores that communicates the filling state of the Ca2+ compartments to plasma membrane store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) channels. STIM1 has been presented as a point of convergence between store-operated and voltage-operated Ca2+ influx, both inducing activation of SOC channels while suppressing Cav1.2 channels. Here we report that Homer proteins play a relevant role in the communication between STIM1 and Cav1.2 channels. HEK-293 cells transiently expressing Cav1.2 channel subunits α1, β2 and α2δ–1 exhibited a significant Ca2+ entry upon treatment with a high concentration of KCl. In Cav1.2-expressing cells, treatment with thapsigargin (TG), to induce passive discharge of the intracellular Ca2+ stores, resulted in Ca2+ influx that was significantly greater than in cells not expressing Cav1.2 channels, a difference that was abolished by nifedipine and diltiazem. Treatment with TG induces co-immunoprecipitation of Homer1 with STIM1 and the Cav1.2 α1 subunit. Impairment of Homer function by introduction of the synthetic PPKKFR peptide into cells, which emulates the proline-rich sequences of the PPXXF motif, or using siRNA Homer1, reduced the association of STIM1 and the Cav1.2 α1 subunit. These findings indicate that Homer is important for the association between both proteins. Finally, treatment with siRNA Homer1 or the PPKKFR peptide enhanced the nifedipine-sensitive component of TG response in Cav1.2-expressing cells. Altogether, these findings provide evidence for a new role of Homer1 supporting the regulation of Cav1.2 channels by STIM1.

Abstract: Amino acid (AA) deprivation in mammalian cells activates a collection of signaling cascades known as the AA response (AAR), which is characterized by transcriptional induction of stress-related genes, including FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (cFOS). The present study established that the signaling mechanism underlying the AA-dependent transcriptional regulation of the cFOS gene in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells is independent of the classic GCN2-eIF2-ATF4 pathway. Instead, a RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade mediates AAR signaling to the cFOS gene. Increased cFOS transcription is observed from 4-24h after AAR-activation, exhibiting little or no overlap with the rapid and transient increase triggered by the well-known serum response. Furthermore, serum is not required for the AA-responsiveness of the cFOS gene and no phosphorylation of promoter-bound serum response factor (SRF) is observed. The ERK-phosphorylated transcription factor E-twenty six-like (p-ELK1) is increased in its association with the cFOS promoter after activation of the AAR. This research identified cFOS as a target of the AAR and further highlights the importance of AA-responsive MAPK signaling in HepG2 cells.

Abstract: The acidic nuclear phosphoproteins (ANP32A-H) are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins with diverse and sometimes opposing cellular functions. Here we show that the oncogenic family members ANP32C and ANP32D are associated in complexes containing the molecular chaperone Hsp90. The oncogenic ANP32C protein appears to be highly unstable with a rapid degradation (t1/2>30min) occurring upon treatment of cells with cycloheximide. ANP32C was also found to be associated with oncogenic Hsp90 complexes by virtue of its ability to interact and be immunoprecipitated by the Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71. Further studies treating cells with the Hsp90 inhibitors PU-H71 and 17-AAG showed atypical increased protein stability and prevention of ANP32C degradation compared to the Hsp90 client AKT. Cells overexpressing ANP32C or its mutant ANP32CY140H showed enhanced sensitivity to treatment with PU-H71 as demonstrated by CCK-8 and colony formation assays. Our results highlight that certain malignancies with ANP32C/D overexpression or mutation might be specifically targeted using Hsp90 inhibitors.

Abstract: Migrating cells sense variations of stiffness in connective tissue matrices but how cells detect and respond to stiffness orientation is not defined. We examined cell extension formation on collagen with underlying support (vertical stiffness gradient) or on collagen laterally supported by nylon (lateral stiffness gradient). At 6h after plating, cells plated on laterally-supported collagen exhibited >2-fold more abundant and ~2-fold longer cell extensions than cells plated on collagen with underlying support. We examined whether p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) influences extension formation that is dependent on the orientation of support. At 6h after plating on collagen with underlying support, wild-type cell extensions were 40% shorter than PAK1 knockdown cells. In contrast, on laterally-supported collagen, wild-type cell extensions were 2-fold longer than PAK1 knockdown cells. In cells plated on laterally-supported collagen, there were ~2-fold reductions of collagen fiber alignment and compaction in PAK1 knockdown cells compared with wild-type cells. PAK1 knockdown did not affect collagen fiber alignment or compaction by cells plated on collagen with underlying support. Wild-type cells with lateral support of collagen exhibited 3-fold increases of phospho-myosin staining at 6h, which was 2-fold lower in PAK1 knockdown cells. In contrast, cells on collagen with underlying support showed no increase of phospho-myosin staining at any times. PAK1 knockdown did not affect α2 or β1 integrin expression or function. We conclude that PAK1 is involved in the ability of cells to sense the orientation of stiffness in collagen substrates and generate contractile forces that affect cell extension formation.

Abstract: There is a wide range of drugs and combinations under investigation and/or approved over the last decade to treat colorectal cancer (CRC), but the 5-year survival rate remains poor at stages II–IV. Therefore, new, more-efficient drugs still need to be developed that will hopefully be included in first-line therapy or overcome resistance when it appears, as part of second- or third-line treatments in the near future. In this study, we revealed that heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors have high therapeutic potential in CRC according to combinative analysis of NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository and chemical genomic database of Connectivity Map (CMap). We found that second generation Hsp90 inhibitor, NVP-AUY922, significantly downregulated the activities of a broad spectrum of kinases involved in regulating cell growth arrest and death of NVP-AUY922-sensitive CRC cells. To overcome NVP-AUY922-induced upregulation of survivin expression which causes drug insensitivity, we found that combining berberine (BBR), a herbal medicine with potency in inhibiting survivin expression, with NVP-AUY922 resulted in synergistic antiproliferative effects for NVP-AUY922-sensitive and -insensitive CRC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that treatment of NVP-AUY922-insensitive CRC cells with the combination of NVP-AUY922 and BBR caused cell growth arrest through inhibiting CDK4 expression and induction of microRNA-296-5p (miR-296-5p)-mediated suppression of Pin1–β-catenin–cyclin D1 signaling pathway. Finally, we found that the expression level of Hsp90 in tumor tissues of CRC was positively correlated with CDK4 and Pin1 expression levels.

Abstract: The vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is crucial for the maintenance of ion homeostasis. Dysregulation of ion homeostasis affects various aspects of cellular processes. However, the importance of V-ATPase in Candida albicans is not totally clear. In this study, we demonstrated the essential roles of V-ATPase through Tfp1, a putative V-ATPase subunit. Deletion of TFP1 led to generation of an iron starvation signal and reduced total iron content, which was associated with mislocalization of Fet34p that was finally due to disorders in copper homeostasis. Furthermore, the tfp1∆/∆ mutant exhibited weaker growth and lower aconitase activity on nonfermentable carbon sources, and iron or copper addition partially rescued the growth defect. In addition, the tfp1∆/∆ mutant also showed elevated cytosolic calcium levels in normal or low calcium medium that were relevant to calcium release from vacuole. Kinetics of cytosolic calcium response to an alkaline pulse and VCX1 (VCX1 encodes a putative vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger) overexpression assays indicated that the cytosolic calcium status was in relation to Vcx1 activity. Spot assay and concentration-kill curve demonstrated that the tfp1∆/∆ mutant was hypersensitive to fluconazole, which was attributed to reduced ergosterol biosynthesis and CDR1 efflux pump activity, and iron/calcium dysregulation. Interestingly, carbon source utilization tests found the tfp1∆/∆ mutant was defective for growth on N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) plate, which was associated with ATP depletion due to the decreased ability to catabolize GlcNAc. Taken together, our study gives new insights into functions of Tfp1, and provides the potential to better exploit V-ATPase as an antifungal target.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence indicates that some miRNAs could form feedback loops with their targets to fine-tune tissue homeostasis, while disruption of these loops constitutes an essential step towards human tumorigenesis. In this study, we report the identification of a novel negative feedback loop formed between miR-139 and its oncogenic target Jun. In this loop, miR-139 could inhibit Jun expression by targeting a conserved site on its 3′-UTR, whereas Jun could induce miR-139 expression in a dose dependent manner through a distant upstream regulatory element. Interestingly, aberration in this loop was found in human gastric cancer, where miR-139 was down-regulated and inversely correlated with Jun expression. Further functional analysis showed that restored expression of miR-139 in gastric cancer cells significantly induces apoptosis, and inhibits cell migration and proliferation as well as tumour growth through targeting Jun. Thus, our data strongly suggests a role of aberrant miR-139/Jun negative feedback loop in the development of human gastric cancer and miR-139 as a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer. Given that miR-139 and Jun are deregulated in many cancers, our findings here might have broader implication in other types of human cancers.

Abstract: The effects of physiological concentration of magnesium on the switch states of the neuronal calcium sensor proteins recoverin, GCAP1 and GCAP2 were investigated. Isothermal titration calorimetry was applied for binding studies. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to characterize protein thermal stability, secondary and tertiary structure in conditions of high and low [Ca2+], mimicking respectively the dark-adapted and light-exposed photoreceptor states during the phototransduction cascade. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were run to investigate the dynamical structural properties of GCAP1 in its activator, inhibitor and putative transitory states. Our results confirmed that Mg2+ is unable to trigger the typical Ca2+-induced conformational change of recoverin (myristoyl switch) while it decreases its thermal stability. Interestingly, Mg2+ seems to affect the conformation of GCAP2 both at high and low [Ca2+], however the variations are more substantial for myristoylated GCAP2 in the absence of Ca2+. GCAP1 is responsive to Mg2+ only in its low [Ca2+] state and Mg2+-GCAP1 tertiary structure slightly differs from both apo and Ca2+-bound states. Finally, MD simulations suggest that the GCAP1 state harboring one Mg2+ ion bound to EF2 acquires structural characteristics that are thought to be relevant for the activation of the guanylate cyclase. Moreover, all the putative Mg2+-bound states of myristoylated GCAP1 are structurally less flexible than Ca2+-bound states. GCAP1 acquires a more compact tertiary structure that is less accessible to the solvent, thereby inducing a different conformation to the myristoyl moiety, which might be crucial for the activation of the guanylate cyclase. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 13th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Diligent balance of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity is essential owing to NF-κB's decisive role in cellular processes including inflammation, immunity and cell survival. Ubiquitin/proteasome-system (UPS)-dependent degradation of activated NF-κB/RelA involves the cullin-RING-ubiquitin-ligase (CRL) ECSSOCS1. The COP9 signalosome (CSN) controls ubiquitin (Ub) ligation by CRLs through the removal of the CRL-activating Ub-like modifier NEDD8 from their cullin subunits and through deubiquitinase (DUB) activity of associated DUBs. However, knowledge about DUBs involved in the regulation of NF-κB activity within the nucleus is scarce. In this study we observed that USP48, a DUB of hitherto ill-defined function identified through a siRNA screen, associates with the CSN and RelA in the nucleus. We show that USP48 trims rather than completely disassembles long K48-linked free and substrate-anchored Ub-chains, a catalytic property only shared with ataxin-3 (Atx3) and otubain-1 (OTU1), and that USP48 Ub-chain-trimming activity is regulated by casein-kinase-2 (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation in response to cytokine-stimulation. Functionally, we demonstrate for the first time the CSN and USP48 to cooperatively stabilize the nuclear pool of RelA, thereby facilitating timely induction and shutoff of NF-κB target genes. In summary, this study demonstrates that USP48, a nuclear DUB regulated by CK2, controls the UPS-dependent turnover of activated NF-κB/RelA in the nucleus together with the CSN. Thereby USP48 contributes to a timely control of immune responses.

Abstract: Cancer cells with defective DNA decatenation checkpoint can be selectively targeted by the catalytic inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) enzyme. Upon treatment with catalytic topo IIα inhibitors, cells with defective decatenation checkpoint fail to arrest their cell cycle in G2 phase and enter into M phase with catenated and under-condensed chromosomes resulting into impaired mitosis and eventually cell death. In the present work we analyzed decatenation checkpoint in five different colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, Caco2, COLO 205 and SW480) and in one non-cancerous cell line (HEK293T). Four out of the five colon cancer cell lines i.e. HCT116, HT-29, Caco2, and COLO 205 were found to be compromised for the decatenation checkpoint function at different extents, whereas SW480 and HEK293T cell lines were found to be proficient for the checkpoint function. Upon treatment with ICRF193, decatenation checkpoint defective cell lines failed to arrest the cell cycle in G2 phase and entered into M phase without proper chromosomal decatenation, resulting into the formation of tangled mass of catenated and under-condensed chromosomes. Such cells underwent mitotic catastrophe and rapid apoptosis like cell death and showed higher sensitivity for ICRF193. Our study suggests that catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase IIα are promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of colon cancers with defective DNA decatenation checkpoint.

Abstract: Chronic inflammation in tumor microenvironment plays an important role at different stages of tumor development. The specific mechanisms of the association and its role in providing a survival advantage to the tumor cells are not well understood. Mitochondria are emerging as a central platform for the assembly of signaling complexes regulating inflammatory pathways, including the activation of type-I IFN and NF-κB. These complexes in turn may affect metabolic functions of mitochondria and promote tumorigenesis. NLRX1, a mitochondrial NOD-like receptor protein, regulate inflammatory pathways, however its role in regulation of cross talk of cell death and metabolism and its implication in tumorigenesis is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that NLRX1 sensitizes cells to TNF-α induced cell death by activating Caspase-8. In the presence of TNF-α, NLRX1 and active subunits of Caspase-8 are preferentially localized to mitochondria and regulate the mitochondrial ROS generation. NLRX1 regulates mitochondrial Complex I and Complex III activities to maintain ATP levels in the presence of TNF-α. The expression of NLRX1 compromises clonogenicity, anchorage-independent growth, migration of cancer cells in vitro and suppresses tumorigenicity in vivo in nude mice. We conclude that NLRX1 acts as a potential tumor suppressor by regulating the TNF-α induced cell death and metabolism.

Abstract: Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are calcium channels modulating important calcium-mediated processes. Recent studies implicate IP3R in cell metabolism, but specific evidence is missing regarding IP3R's effects on actual metabolic pathways and key energy metabolites. Here, we applied metabolomics and molecular biology to compare DT40 cell lines devoid of IP3R (KO) and its wild-type (WT) counterpart. NMR and LC–MS metabolomic data showed that the KO cell line has a very different basic energy metabolism from the WT cell line, showing enhanced Warburg effect. In particular, the KO cells exhibited significant perturbation in energy charge, reduced glutathione and NADPH ratios with slower cellular growth rate. Subsequent flow cytometry results showed that the KO cell line has a higher level of general reactive oxygen species (ROS) but has a lower level of peroxynitrites. This ROS disturbance could be explained by observing lower expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and unchanged expression of catalase. The higher ROS seems to be involved in the slower growth rate of the KO cells, with an ROS scavenger increasing their growth rate. However, the KO and WT cell lines did not show any noticeable differences in AMPK and phosphorylated AMPK levels, suggesting possible saturation of AMPK-mediated metabolic regulatory circuit in both cells. Overall, our study reveals IP3R's roles in ROS homeostasis and metabolic pathways as well as the effects of its KO on cellular phenotypes.

Abstract: Nur77 is a transcription factor, which plays a determinant role in mediating T cell receptor-induced cell death of thymocytes. In addition to regulation of transcription, Nur77 contributes to apoptosis induction by targeting mitochondria, where it can convert Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein into a proapoptotic molecule. Previous studies have demonstrated that retinoids are actively produced in the mouse thymus and can induce a transcription-dependent apoptosis in mouse thymocytes. Here we show that retinoic acids induce the expression of Nur77, and retinoid-induced apoptosis is completely dependent on Nur77, as retinoids were unable to induce apoptosis in Nur77 null thymocytes. In wild-type thymocytes retinoids induced enhanced expression of the apoptosis-related genes FasL, TRAIL, NDG-1, Gpr65 and Bid, all of them in a Nur77-dependent manner. The combined action of these proteins led to Caspase 8-dependent Bid cleavage in the mitochondria. In addition, we could demonstrate the Nur77-dependent induction of STAT1 leading to enhanced Bim expression, and the mitochondrial translocation of Nur77 leading to the exposure of the Bcl-2/BH3 domain. The retinoid-induced apoptosis was dependent on both Caspase 8 and STAT1. Our data together indicate that retinoids induce a Nur77-dependent cell death program in thymocytes activating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.

Abstract: Cellular mechanics plays a crucial role in many biological processes such as cell migration, cell growth, embryogenesis, and oncogenesis. Epithelia respond to environmental cues comprising biochemical and physical stimuli through defined changes in cell elasticity. For instance, cells can differentiate between certain properties such as viscoelasticity or topography of substrates by adapting their own elasticity and shape. A living cell is a complex viscoelastic body that not only exhibits a shell architecture composed of a membrane attached to a cytoskeleton cortex but also generates contractile forces through its actomyosin network. Here we review cellular mechanics of single cells in the context of epithelial cell layers responding to chemical and physical stimuli.

Abstract: In amphibian embryos, our previous work has demonstrated that calcium transients occurring in the dorsal ectoderm at the onset of gastrulation are necessary and sufficient to engage the ectodermal cells into a neural fate by inducing neural specific genes. Some of these genes are direct targets of calcium. Here we search for a direct transcriptional mechanism by which calcium signals are acting. The only known mechanism responsible for a direct action of calcium on gene transcription involves an EF-hand Ca2+ binding protein which belongs to a group of four proteins (Kcnip1 to 4). Kcnip protein can act in a Ca2+-dependent manner as a transcriptional repressor by binding to a specific DNA sequence, the Downstream Regulatory Element (DRE) site. In Xenopus, among the four kcnips, we show that only kcnip1 is timely and spatially present in the presumptive neural territories and is able to bind DRE sites in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The loss of function of kcnip1 results in the expansion of the neural plate through an increased proliferation of neural progenitors. Later on, this leads to an impairment in the development of anterior neural structures. We propose that, in the embryo, at the onset of neurogenesis Kcnip1 is the Ca2+-dependent transcriptional repressor that controls the size of the neural plate. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 13th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Cancer-associated fibroblasts play a crucial role in accelerating tumor progression, but there is a knowledge gap regarding the chemotactic signal activated in a tumor microenvironment. In this study, the expression of type IV collagen was knocked down using a lentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNA strategy. Although there was no obvious effect on cell growth in vitro, silencing the Col4-α1 gene decreased the tumorigenicity of B16F10 in C57BL/6 mice, which was accompanied by a reduction in the infiltration of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive (α-SMA+) fibroblasts. Silencing the Col4-α1 gene or disrupting integrin engagement by blocking the antibody reduced the expression of platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A), a potent chemotactic factor for fibroblasts. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the autoclustering integrin mutant significantly stimulated PDGF-A expression in murine B16F10 and human U118MG and Huh7 cells. PDGF-A-specific sh-RNA and neutralizing anti-PDGF-A antibody effectively inhibited the transwell migration of fibroblasts. Adding recombinant PDGF-A back to shCol cell-conditioned media restored the fibroblast-attraction ability indicating that PDGF-A is a major chemotactic factor for fibroblasts in the current study model. The integrin-associated PDGF-A production correlated with the activation of Src and ERK. High type IV collagen staining intensity colocalized with elevated PDGF-A expression was observed in tumor tissues obtained from hepatoma and glioma patients. The integrin signal pathway was activated by collagen engagement through Src and ERK, leading to enhanced PDGF-A production, which serves as a key regulator of fibroblast recruitment.

Abstract: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a type I integral membrane protein that is expressed in the central nervous system. MOG has a single N-glycosylation site within its extracellular domain. MOG has been linked with pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis; anti-MOG antibodies have been detected in the sera of multiple sclerosis patients. N-glycosylation is an important post-translational modification of protein that might impact their folding, localization and function. However, the role of sugar in the biology of MOG is not well understood. In this study, we created a mutant MOG lacking N-linked glycan and tested its properties. We concluded that the lack of sugar did not impact on MOG abundance in the absence of endoplasmic reticulum molecular chaperone calnexin. We also show that the absence of N-glycan did not interfere with MOG's subcellular localization and it did not result in activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 13th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide; PDAC is characterized by poor prognosis, resistance to conventional chemotherapy and high mortality rate. TP53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in PDAC, resulting in the accumulation of mutated protein with potential gain-of-function (GOF) activities, such as genomic instability, hyperproliferation and chemoresistance. The purpose of this study was to assess the relevance of the p53 status on the PDAC cells response to the standard drug gemcitabine. We also examined the potential therapeutic effect of p53-reactivating molecules to restore the mutant p53 function in GEM treated PDAC cells. We showed that gemcitabine stabilized mutant p53 protein in the nuclei and induced chemoresistance, concurrent with the mutant p53-dependent expression of Cdk1 and CCNB1 genes, resulting in a hyperproliferation effect. Despite the adverse activation of mutant p53 by gemcitabine, simultaneous treatment of PDAC cells with gemcitabine and p53-reactivating molecules (CP-31398 and RITA) reduced growth rate and induced apoptosis. This synergistic effect was observed in both wild-type and mutant p53 cell lines and was absent in p53-null cells. The combination drug treatment induced p53 phosphorylation on Ser15, apoptosis and autophagosome formation. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy further increased apoptosis stimulated by gemcitabine/CP-31398 treatment. Together, our results show that gemcitabine aberrantly stimulates mutant p53 activity in PDAC cells identifying key processes with potential for therapeutic targeting. Our data also support an anti-tumoral strategy based on inhibition of autophagy combined with p53 activation and standard chemotherapy for both wild-type and mutant p53 expressing PDACs.

Abstract: The tumor suppressor protein programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4) is a highly conserved RNA-binding protein that inhibits the translation of specific mRNAs. Here, we have identified the homeobox-interacting protein kinase-2 (Hipk2) mRNA as a novel translational target of Pdcd4. Unlike most other protein kinases Hipk2 is constitutively active after being synthesized by the ribosome and its expression and activity are thought to be mainly controlled by modulation of the half-life of the kinase. Our work provides the first evidence that Hipk2 expression is also controlled on the level of translation. We show that Hipk2 stimulates the translation of its own mRNA and that Pdcd4 suppresses the translation of Hipk2 mRNA by interfering with this auto-regulatory feedback mechanism. We also show that the translation of the related kinase Hipk1 is controlled by a similar feedback loop and that Hipk2 also stimulates the translation of Hipk1 mRNA. Taken together, our work describes a novel mechanism of translational suppression by Pdcd4 and shows for the first time that Hipk2 controls its own synthesis by an auto-regulatory feedback mechanism. Furthermore, the effect of Hipk2 on the translation of Hipk1 RNA suggests that Hipk2 and Pdcd4 can act in similar manner to control the translation of other mRNAs.

Abstract: Emerging evidence suggests that activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy gauge and redox sensor, controls the cell cycle and protects against DNA damage. However, the molecular mechanisms by which AMPKα isoform regulates DNA damage remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine if AMPKα deletion contributes to cellular hyperproliferation by reducing p21WAF1/Cip1 (p21) expression thereby leading to accumulated DNA damage. The markers for DNA damage, cell cycle proteins, and apoptosis were monitored in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from wild type (WT, C57BL/6J), AMPKα1, or AMPKα2 homozygous deficient (AMPKα1−/−, AMPKα2−/−) mice by Western blot, flow cytometry, and cellular immunofluorescence staining. Deletion of AMPKα1, the predominant AMPKα isoform, but not AMPKα2 in immortalized MEFs led to spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) which corresponded to repair protein p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) foci formation and subsequent apoptosis. Furthermore, AMPKα1 localizes to chromatin and AMPKα1 deletion down-regulates cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, an important protein that plays a role in decreasing the incidence of spontaneous DSB via inhibition of cell proliferation. In addition, AMPKα1 null cells exhibited enhanced cell proliferation. Finally, p21 overexpression partially blocked the cellular hyperproliferation of AMPKα1-deleted MEFs via the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Taken together, our results suggest that AMPKα1 plays a fundamental role in controlling the cell cycle thereby affecting DNA damage and cellular apoptosis.

Abstract: The majority of known nucleolar proteins are freely exchanged between the nucleolus and the surrounding nucleoplasm. One way proteins are retained in the nucleoli is by the presence of specific amino acid sequences, namely nucleolar localization signals (NoLSs). The mechanism by which NoLSs retain proteins inside the nucleoli is still unclear. Here, we present data showing that the charge-dependent (electrostatic) interactions of NoLSs with nucleolar components lead to nucleolar accumulation as follows: (i) known NoLSs are enriched in positively charged amino acids, but the NoLS structure is highly heterogeneous, and it is not possible to identify a consensus sequence for this type of signal; (ii) in two analyzed proteins (NF-κB-inducing kinase and HIV-1 Tat), the NoLS corresponds to a region that is enriched for positively charged amino acid residues; substituting charged amino acids with non-charged ones reduced the nucleolar accumulation in proportion to the charge reduction, and nucleolar accumulation efficiency was strongly correlated with the predicted charge of the tested sequences; and (iii) sequences containing only lysine or arginine residues (which were referred to as imitative NoLSs, or iNoLSs) are accumulated in the nucleoli in a charge-dependent manner. The results of experiments with iNoLSs suggested that charge-dependent accumulation inside the nucleoli was dependent on interactions with nucleolar RNAs. The results of this work are consistent with the hypothesis that nucleolar protein accumulation by NoLSs can be determined by the electrostatic interaction of positively charged regions with nucleolar RNAs rather than by any sequence-specific mechanism.

Abstract: SH3 domains are evolutionarily conserved protein interaction domains that control nearly all cellular processes in eukaryotes. The current model is that most SH3 domains bind discreet PxxPxR motifs with weak affinity and relatively low selectivity. However, the interactions of full-length SH3 domain-containing proteins with ligands are highly specific and have much stronger affinity. This suggests that regions outside of PxxPxR motifs drive these interactions. In this study, we observed that PxxPxR motifs were required for the binding of the adaptor protein GRB2 to short peptides from its ligand SOS1. Surprisingly, PxxPxR motifs from the proline rich region of SOS1 or CBL were neither necessary nor sufficient for the in vitro or in vivo interaction with full-length GRB2. Together, our findings show that regions outside of the consensus PxxPxR sites drive the high affinity association of GRB2 with SH3 domain ligands, suggesting that the binding mechanism for this and other SH3 domain interactions may be more complex than originally thought.

Abstract: Mammalian diaphanous1 (mDia1) is a homologue of Drosophila diaphanous and belongs to the Formin-homology family of proteins that catalyze actin nucleation and polymerization. Although Formin family proteins, such as Drosophila diaphanous, have been shown to be essential for cytokinesis, whether and how mDia1 functions during meiosis remain uncertain. In this study, we explored possible roles and the signaling pathway involved for mDia1 using a mouse oocyte model. mDia1 depletion reduced polar body extrusion, which may have been due to reduced cortical actin assembly. mDia1 and Profilin1 had similar localization patterns in mouse oocytes and mDia1 knockdown resulted in reduced Profilin1 expression. Depleting FMNL1, another Formin family member, resulted in reduced mDia1 expression, while RhoA inhibition did not alter mDia1 expression, which indicated that there was a FMNL1-mDia1-Profilin1 signaling pathway in mouse oocytes. Additionally, mDia1 knockdown resulted in disrupting oocyte spindle morphology, which was confirmed by aberrant p-MAPK localization. Thus, these results demonstrated indispensable roles for mDia1 in regulating mouse oocyte meiotic maturation through its effects on actin assembly and spindle organization.

Abstract: Non-capacitative calcium entry (NCCE) contributes to cell activation in response to the occupation of G protein-coupled membrane receptors. Thrombin administration to platelets evokes the synthesis of diacylglycerol downstream of PAR receptor activation. Diacylglycerol evokes NCCE through activating TRPC3 and TRPC6 in human platelets. Although it is known that immunophilins interact with TRPCs, the role of immunophilins in the regulation of NCCE remains unknown. Platelet incubation with FK506, an immunophilin antagonist, reduced OAG-evoked NCCE in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect that was independent on the inactivation of calcineurin (CaN). FK506 was unable to reduce NCCE evoked by OAG in platelets from TRPC6−/− mice. In HEK-293 cells overexpressing TRPC6, currents through TRPC6 were altered in the presence of FK506. We have found interaction between FKBP38 and other FKBPs, like FKBP25, FKBP12, and FKBP52 that were not affected by FK506, as well as with calmodulin (CaM). FK506 modified the pattern of association between FKBP25 and TRPCs as well as impaired OAG-evoked TRPC3 and TRPC6 coupling in both human and mouse platelets. By performing biotinylation experiments we have elucidated that FKBP25 and FKBP38 might be found at different cellular location, the plasma membrane and the already described intracellular locations. Finally, FKBP25 and FKBP38 silencing significantly inhibits OAG-evoked NCCE in MEG-01 and HEK293 cells, while overexpression of FKBP38 does not modify NCCE in HEK293 cells. All together, these findings provide strong evidence for a role of immunophilins, including FKBP25 and FKBP38, in NCCE mediated by TRPC6.

Abstract: In eukaryotic protein synthesis the translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is a key player in the recruitment and assembly of the translation initiation machinery. Mammalian eIF3 consists of 13 subunits, including the loosely associated eIF3j subunit that plays a stabilizing role in the eIF3 complex formation and interaction with the 40S ribosomal subunit. By means of both co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses we demonstrate that the protein kinase CK2 interacts with and phosphorylates eIF3j at Ser127. Inhibition of CK2 activity by CX-4945 or down-regulation of the expression of CK2 catalytic subunit by siRNA cause the dissociation of j-subunit from the eIF3 complex as judged from glycerol gradient sedimentation. This finding proves that CK2-phosphorylation of eIF3j is a prerequisite for its association with the eIF3 complex. Expression of Ser127Ala-eIF3j mutant impairs both the interaction of mutated j-subunit with the other eIF3 subunits and the overall protein synthesis. Taken together our data demonstrate that CK2-phosphorylation of eIF3j at Ser127 promotes the assembly of the eIF3 complex, a crucial step in the activation of the translation initiation machinery.

Abstract: The amount of transcription factor OCT4 is strictly regulated. A tight regulation of OCT4 levels is crucial for mammalian embryonic development and oncogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying regulation of OCT4 protein expression and nuclear distribution are largely unknown. Here, we report that DPF2, a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger protein, is upregulated during H9 cell differentiation induced by retinoic acid. Endogenous interaction between DPF2 and OCT4 in P19 cells was revealed by an immunoprecipitation assay. GST-pull down assay proved that OCT4 protein in H9 cells and recombinant OCT4 can precipitate with DPF2 in vitro. In vitro ubiquitination assay demonstrated DPF2 might serve as an E3 ligase. Knock down of dpf2 using siRNA increased OCT4 protein level and stability in P19 cells. DPF2 siRNAs also up-regulates OCT4 but not NANOG in H9 cells. However, RA fails to downregulates OCT4 protein level in cells infected by lenitviruses containing DPF2 siRNA. Moreover, overexpression of both DPF2 and OCT4 in 293 cells proved the DPF2–OCT4 interaction. DPF2 but not PHD2 mutant DPF2 enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of OCT4 in 293 cells co-expressed DPF2 and OCT4. Both wild type DPF2 and PHD2 mutant DPF2 redistributes nuclear OCT4 without affecting DPF2–OCT4 interaction. Further analysis indicated that DPF2 decreases monomeric and mono-ubiquitinated OCT4, assembles poly-ubiquitin chains on OCT4 mainly through Ub–K48 linkage. These findings contribute to an understanding of how OCT4 protein level and nuclear distribution is regulated by its associated protein.

Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase catalyzes Tyr-19 and Tyr-27 phosphorylation of caveolin-2 (cav-2), leading to stimulation of signaling proteins downstream of IR, and that the catalysis is dependent on fatty acylation status of cav-2, promoting its interaction with IR. Cav-2 is myristoylated at Gly-2 and palmitoylated at Cys-109, Cys-122, and Cys-145. The fatty acylation deficient mutants are unable to localize in the plasma membrane and not phosphorylated by IR tyrosine kinase. IR interacts with the C-terminal domain of cav-2 containing the cysteines for palmitoylation. IR mutants, Y999F and K1057A, but not W1220S, fail interaction with cav-2. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is recruited to interact with the IR-catalyzed phospho-tyrosine cav-2, which facilitates IRS-1 association with and activation by IR to initiate IRS-1-mediated downstream signaling. Cav-2 fatty acylation and tyrosine phosphorylation are necessary for the IRS-1-dependent PI3K-Akt and ERK activations responsible for glucose uptake and cell survival and proliferation. In conclusion, fatty acylated cav-2 is a new substrate of IR tyrosine kinase, and the fatty acylation and phosphorylation of cav-2 present novel mechanisms by which insulin signaling is activated.

Abstract: Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) senses depletion of ER–Ca2+ store and clusters in ER–PM junctions where it associates with and gates Ca2+ influx channels, Orai1 and TRPC1. Clustering of TRPC1 with STIM1 and Orai1 in these junctions is critical since Orai1-mediated Ca2+ entry triggers surface expression of TRPC1 while STIM1 gates the channel. Thus, plasma membrane function of TRPC1 depends on the delivery of the channel to the sites where STIM1 puncta are formed. This study examines intracellular trafficking mechanism(s) that determine plasma membrane expression and function of TRPC1 in cells where Orai1 and TRPC1 are endogenously expressed and contribute to Ca2+ entry. We report that TRPC1 is internalized by Arf6-dependent pathway, sorted to Rab5-containing early endosomes, and trafficked to ER–PM junctions by Rab4-dependent fast recycling. Overexpression of Arf6, or Rab5, but not the respective dominant negative mutants, induced retention of TRPC1 in early endosomes and suppressed TRPC1 function. Notably, cells expressing Arf6 or Rab5 displayed an inwardly rectifying ICRAC current that is mediated by Orai1 instead of TRPC1-associated ISOC, demonstrating that Orai1 function was not altered. Importantly, expression of Rab4, but not STIM1, with Rab5 rescued surface expression and function of TRPC1, restoring generation of ISOC. Together, these data demonstrate that trafficking via fast recycling endosomes determines TRPC1–STIM1 clustering within ER–PM junctions following ER–Ca2+ store depletion which is critical for the surface expression and function of the channel. Ca2+ influx mediated by TRPC1 modifies Ca2+-dependent physiological response of cells.

Abstract: In the protozoa parasite Giardia lamblia, endocytosis and lysosomal protein trafficking are vital parasite-specific processes that involve the action of the adaptor complexes AP-1 and AP-2 and clathrin. In this work, we have identified a single gene in Giardia encoding a protein containing an ENTH domain that defines monomeric adaptor proteins of the epsin family. This domain is present in the epsin or epsin-related (epsinR) adaptor proteins, which are implicated in endocytosis and Golgi-to-endosome protein trafficking, respectively, in other eukaryotic cells. We found that GlENTHp (for G. lamblia ENTH protein) localized in the cytosol, strongly interacted with PI3,4,5P3, was associated with the alpha subunit of AP-2, clathrin and ubiquitin and was involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. It also bonded PI4P, the gamma subunit of AP-1 and was implicated in ER-to-PV trafficking. Alteration of the GlENTHp function severely affected trophozoite growth showing an unusual accumulation of dense material in the lysosome-like peripheral vacuoles (PVs), indicating that GlENTHp might be implicated in the maintenance of PV homeostasis. In this study, we showed evidence suggesting that GlENTHp might function as a monomeric adaptor protein supporting the findings of other group indicating that GlENTHp might be placed at the beginning of the ENTH family.

Abstract: The use of 3-dimensional (3D) collagen gels has yielded new insights into the migratory behaviour of cancer cells. While the large GTPase dynamin has emerged as an important regulator of cancer cell migration and invasion under 2D conditions, its role in 3D migration is unclear. We have used a potent dynamin modulator, a bis-tyrphostin derivative, Ryngo® 1-23, to investigate the role of dynamin in 3D migration in 3 different cell lines. The compound specifically inhibits persistent, elongated 3D migration in U87MG and SMA-560 cells. Treated U87MG cells adopt a rounded morphology that is not due to apoptosis, loss of matrix metalloprotease activity or inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Given that Ryngo 1-23 is known to regulate dynamin oligomerisation and actin dynamics at the leading edge, we analysed actin filament distribution. Ryngo 1-23 induced a switch in actin filament organization in 3D cultures resulting in the generation of multiple short actin-rich microspikes. Correlated with the change in actin filament distribution, cells displayed reduced collagen gel contraction. Since acto-myosin force transmission to the extra-cellular matrix underpins persistent, elongated migration, our results suggest that Ryngo 1-23 modulates this process in 3D migration via dynamin-mediated regulation of acto-myosin force transmission to the extra-cellular matrix.

Abstract: Programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) plays a crucial role in TP53-mediated apoptosis, but the regulatory mechanism of PDCD5 itself during apoptosis remains obscure. We identified YY1-associated factor 2 (YAF2) as a novel PDCD5-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen for PDCD5-interacting proteins. We found that YY1-associated factor 2 (YAF2) binds to and increases PDCD5 stability by inhibiting the ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation pathway. However, knocking-down of YAF2 diminishes the levels of PDCD5 protein but not the levels of PDCD5 mRNA. Upon genotoxic stress response, YAF2 promotes TP53 activation via association with PDCD5. Strikingly, YAF2 failed to promote TP53 activation in the deletion of PDCD5, whereas restoration of wild-type PDCD5WT efficiently reversed the ineffectiveness of YAF2 on TP53 activation. Conversely, PDCD5 efficiently overcame the knockdown effect of YAF2 on ET-induced TP53 activation. Finally, impaired apoptosis upon PDCD5 ablation was substantially rescued by restoration of PDCD5WT but not YAF2-interacting defective PDCD5E4D nor TP53-interacting defective PDCD5E16D mutant. Our findings uncovered an apoptotic signaling cascade linking YAF2, PDCD5, and TP53 during genotoxic stress responses.

Abstract: The transcription factor NF-κB family serves as a key component of many pathophysiological events such as innate and adaptive immune response, inflammation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis. Various cell signals trigger activation of the regulatory mechanisms of NF-κB, resulting in its nuclear translocation and transcriptional initiation. The diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) family, a lipid second messenger-metabolizing enzyme in phosphoinositide signaling, is shown to regulate widely various cellular processes. Results of recent studies suggest that one family member, DGKζ, is closely involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Nevertheless, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of DGKζ on NF-κB pathway in cytokine-induced inflammatory signaling. This study shows that siRNA-mediated DGKζ knockdown in HeLa cells facilitates degradation of IκB, followed by nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit. In addition, DGKζ-deficient MEFs show upregulation of p65 subunit phosphorylation at Serine 468 and 536 and its interaction with CBP transcriptional coactivator upon TNF-α stimulation. These modifications of p65 subunit might engender enhanced NF-κB transcriptional reporter assay of DGKζ knockdown cells. These findings provide further insight into the regulatory mechanisms of cytokine-induced NF-κB activation.
